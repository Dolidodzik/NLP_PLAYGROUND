4,"This book centers on the security of the Camp Half-blood. The Thalia's tree protecting the camp is poisoned and the camp is at risk. Percy needs a quest to go in search of a golden fleece but the camp director who already dislikes Percy, doesn't give him the permission. But Percy disregards him and along with his friends Annabeth and Tyson goes on a quest to the Sea of Monsters to retrieve the Golden Fleece and rescue their friend Grover, who is in trouble. 
 I am very interested in the Greek gods and was hence very delighted to read the series. I didn't enjoy this book as much as the first book. But it was still entertaining and action-packed. The ending made me want to read more, didn't see that coming. I can't wait to continue on with the series. 
 Sea of monsters was an overall fun read. So I gave it 4 stars."
4,"really 3.5. there were some good things about this book, but i don't think it was as good as the earlier ones."
3,"A Crown of Wishes is a book about a couple of 18-year-olds snarking at each other. Is it funny? Oh yes, but in that Rom-Com 'laugh or roll your eyes' kind of way. 
 But I'm being critical up front, so now that that's out of the way... 
 Chokshi has no problem making her fantasies 'fantastic.' Much like in The Star-Touched Queen, the Otherworld is full of metaphors made manifest: stories in the form of birds, fruit that brings out who you really are, a land pulled directly from your dreams (or nightmares), a hunt for the key to immortality, and I love it just as much here as I did before. 
 ...perhaps more, since Vikram and Gauri don't have the entanglement of a love and destiny that spans lifetimes pulling them together, but rather spend most of the book deliberately needling each other. It's petty, funny, and occasionally juvenile, but also very human, which makes the story more relatable. 
 In sum, it's a cute book. Not sure what else to say."
4,"After waiting almost a year, we finally got Jory's book. I mean we read about him two years ago when he was first mentioned in Forgotten Sins as the MIA brother who they suspected was murdered. Of course that isn't so, and this is not even a spoiler. 
 But the mystery surrounding the missing Jory had been speculated since Book 1 and continue throughout the series. Finally we are getting some answers! 
 The heroine, Piper came in the form of a skilled hacker employed by the evil Commander to help remove Jory's kill-chip because the Commander can't just let his 'creation' die. You know since Sweet Revenge, we knew the brothers only have 6 weeks to live unless they remove the chip in time. I can't believe I spent more than a year waiting for their 6 weeks to take place. 
 In the beginning, Piper was lead to believe that Jory was a traitor, thus she was having a hard time believing that Jory was innocent. Piper real identity also came as a surprise and resulting in a quite a delicate situation between her and the brothers. 
 I felt the romance was done just alright due the limited time they had shared. From the time they met until the climatic ending, they only have one week left before the kill-chip detonation. Is hard to make it into the kind of epic love like Nate and Audrey. Therefore, in my opinion compare to the rest of the brothers, I think Jory had a weaker romance plot. 
 To me, the highlight of The Sin Brothers series are always the fast pacing plot, action-packed, suspense, romance and the camaraderie among the Dean brothers. The major draw for me is always the brothers, especially when they blow things up together. They are all so badass. I know, is confusing why the series is called Sin Brothers, but in actuality they are the Dean brothers. 
 Honestly, I thought this is the last book of the series. But apparently Rebecca is gearing for more or maybe a spin-off. I'm not sure whether I like the similar direction that the author seems to do going for. (view spoiler)[To me, Chance and his brothers sound too similar to Matt and his brothers. (hide spoiler)] Since I had finished all 4 books according to sequence, I shall gladly declare that I love Blind Faith featuring Nate's story the most."
5,"Oh wow, what an amazingly compelling, vivid and passionate book! 
 It seems like everyone is raving about this book, so I had to pick it up and read it for myself. And I can only join the raves! The story is phenomenal. Each and every scene is described with such rich words and vivid expressions that you're instantly drawn into the midst of what's happening. I didn't just get to observe the story, it felt like I was living in it--living in a Tim Burton movie. Think of a gothic version of Alice in Wonderland mixed with Beetlejuice and Corpse Bride and you'll get a hint of how absolutely stunning (and terrifying) the world of Under is. 
 There is not one thing I didn't adore about this book. 
 All the characters are very well developed, really likable and have an own personality. Donny, Ame (Theia's best friends) and the rest don't act as plain side-kicks and are perfectly capable to stand on their own feet. The premise is unlike anything I've read before. Oh, and did I tell you how I'm not the biggest fan of stories in which the two protagonists can't touch for some reason? Gwen Hayes did manage to find a way to make the air around Theia and Haden sizzle even without touching. She let them ""touch by proxy"" (if you can call it that), and oh, dear God, it was so lustful I had goose bumps. [image error](P.S.: Worry not! They soon break the ""no-touching"" rule, which doesn't make their relationship less passionate. Far from it.) 
 It's a must read, and I cannot wait for the sequel to come out!"
4,"I've had Jessica's Guide sitting on my shelf for about a year now, maybe even longer. The concept appealed to me at first, but then I lost interest and shelved it for a while (all those vampire YA's, just...over-saturated feeling). I recently picked it back up again because I want to read Fantaskey's upcoming novel Jekel Loves Hyde, so I figured I should get a handle on her writing tone. 
 I was pleasantly surprised by this book. It had what sounded like the hallmarks of clichedom--dark, brooding alpha male vampire, kind of useless but secretly powerful girl, dippy friend, witchy popular girl--but Fantaskey wrote them in a wholly entertaining way. Lucius was definitely vying for creeper of the year with much of his behavior towards and for Jessica, but admittedly he was raised in a ruthless manner and taught that women are given respect by males--but men still get all the respect from everyone. His arrogance was almost charming since for all his bluster he didn't push Jessica too far. 
 Jessica, who spent a small portion of the book insufferably wishy-washy about how she liked Jake but was lusting hardcore for Lucius, wised up. His attempts to convince her of both his vampireness and her true heritage, and her attempts to rationalize weird inhuman behavior, are kind of amusing. Later, when her mom makes some rather pointed remarks about Jessica's 'rational' heroes, I thought it was deserved and well played. Her parents clearly supported Lucius, but they both retained a realistic expectation--they were not going to force her if she was truly against the match. 
 I would have liked to know more about her vampire family and have spent less time on her rejecting everything Lucius was. The end also, when Jessica comes into her own and teaches Lucius a lesson, could have been fleshed out a little more as well. While it does tie up practically all the loose ends, some of the character relationships and consequences were ignored for the sake of the climax of the story. Reading the first chapter of the Sequel Story (who's title I can't type here as its a pretty big spoiler for this book) some of those issues are resolved however. 
 This was definitely a darker read then I originally expected. Somewhere along the way I got the idea that this is meant as a parody of the Twilight and Twilight-like novels. Honestly Fantaskey's writing reminded me of L.J. Smith's, during the Night World series, with its mixture of dark comedy, harsh realities and rough courtship shenanigans."
3,"There were many things here that I liked - a fairly original story despite the ""fairytale retelling"" elements, an pretty capable female heroine and an actually largely female cast, a cute enough love story. But somehow it didn't fully connect with me. I liked but didn't love it, though it's still on the higher ranks of the books of it's kind I've read lately."
5,"What surprised me about this retelling of Hansel and Gretel was not the brilliance and beauty of the sentences (it's Neil Gaiman, so I expected that) but rather the use of darkness in the illustrations. So often Hansel and Gretel books feature bright, cheery colors, particularly in the house made out of candy. But there is none of that in this book, because the story really is about darkness and how you might survive it. The use of white and even gray is so minimal that it draws great attention to movement, to a particular focus. The closest parallel I can think of is the German expressionism film movement in the 1920s. 
 The other thing I loved about this book is that Neil Gaiman's retelling reminds us that fairy tales are not meant just for children--they are for all of us. (In fact, my toddlers couldn't sit still for the book--too many paragraphs and words for the page. I read this book simply for me. Though I will read it to them in a few years.) Gaiman manages to capture the sketch-feel of a fairy tale while also bringing us in a little closer point of view. An excellent read, which I highly recommend."

5,"Another fantastic book by the epically awesome Laurie Halse Anderson. 
 'Fever 1793' is set in Philadelphia in the summer of 1793. Yellow fever breaks out, and what starts as just another summer fever becomes a deadly epidemic that wipes out whole families, and causes people to abandon the city. Mattie lives with her widowed mother, grandfather, and their African-American servant, Eliza, above the family coffee shop. When her mother becomes ill, Mattie is sent to live at a friend's house in the countryside, along with her grandfather. On the journey, however, they are abandoned at the side of the road when Mattie's grandfather falls sick. From this moment on, Mattie has to find a way to survive - first on the road and in a fever hospital, and then back in Philadelphia. When she returns to Philadelphia, survival is even harder than it was out on the road - her mother and Eliza are gone, their coffee shop has been broken into and robbed, food is scarce, and sickness is everywhere. 
 I was originally a little wary about this book because of it's historical context, I worried that Mattie might be some cliched historical character. I should not have worried - as with all of Anderson's protagonists, Mattie is fantastic. What I was most impressed by was how, although Anderson made Mattie true to her time (worrying about showing her elbows in front of the boy she likes, bathing once a month etc) she makes Mattie a *teenager* and in some ways, teenagers, even before they were called that, haven't changed. Mattie argues with her mother, wants to sleep in, both likes and kicks the butt of a boy she likes, and isn't afraid to share her opinions and stand up for herself. 
 The historical context of the yellow fever epidemic of 1793 - which I knew nothing about - was fascinating, as was the portrayal of post-war of independence America. 
 I liked the supporting characters as well, especially Mattie's grandfather."
5,"I went into this book cold, that is to say I knew no more about it than its famous title. I was intrigued but at the same time worried about the quality of the language or like ability of the story. I needn't have wasted my energy - ""The age of innocence"" is a masterpiece that has that essential flow that enables one to read it hours on end without ever getting tired but ever more urged to read on (which is how I came to finish it in about a days time). 
 The world Wharton describes is to me as foreign as anything out of the Arabian nights and I feel glad to never have been any sort of member of this kind of 'society' which is described with a painstaking detail that resonates of authenticity. The rather off-hand but sometimes scathing comments on this society are lively and can inflame a heart even decades later while serving to remember that the setting of this book is not that far off really. 
 I thoroughly enjoy Wharton's writing, her easy shifts from feelings and actions, though (and I don't mean this in an negative manner should it come across as such) but Archer has the definite touch having been written by a woman. The whole text is feminine to me, which should be read more as a statement than a judgement, from someone who will now on count Newland Archer as one of her favorite literary characters. 
 Quotes: 
 On society - ""Archer had gone to the house an hour earlier in full agreement with Mr Letterblair's view; but put into words by this selfish, well-fed and supremely indifferent old man it suddenly became the Pharisaic voice of a society wholly absorbed in barricading itself against the unpleasant."" 
 An example of where I find a (well spoken) feminine agenda: ""It would presently be his task to take the bandage from this young woman's eyes, and bid her look forth on the world. But how many generations of the women who had gone to her making had descended bandaged into the family vault? He shivered a little, remembering some of the new ideas in his scientific books, and the much cited instance of the Kentucky cave-fish, which had ceased to develop eyes because they had no use for them."" 
 It is lines like that that make me feel that ''The age of innocene"" should be more mandatory to read in schools than is ""Madam Bovary"" or Jane Austen. Edith Wharton, the first female winner of the Pulitzer price deserves a wider recognition than she has gotten."
5,"** spoiler alert ** 
 This is the 6th and final book in the Vampire Academy series. I loved this book as well as the series. Richelle Mead is one of my favorite authors, she truly has a golden pen. 
 Being a final book there was a lot to close-up and most last books there are still lingering questions, but not this book. The whole love triangle with Rose, Dimitri and Adrian was closed up. I know that there are Adrian fans out there and I am one as well. I found his character endearing and funny but I am more than happy to find that Rose and Dimitri found their way back to one another. 
 The 5 books prior to this one was based on their attraction to one another and then their love, once they gave into it. Dimitri is everything a leading man should be: strong, smart, hot and dare I say? god like.... 
 Lissa, and her now new found sister, Christian and his Aunt Tasha all had their moments in this book, you were left knowing the who, what, when and the whys. 
 Mead out did herself with this storyline. She kept Rose her smartass, tough and endearing self and made sure that the core of the Vampire Academy series was still left very much in tact. 
 I was a bit surprised at first on how Mead left Adrian's loose ends untied but then I realized that she is writing spin off series and maybe, just maybe Adrian may be a character. 
 Overall the the book was great and had a satisfying ending to a series that had me hooked from the beginning. The book was a story that had both a great romance and friendship. It had high and lows and never for a minute did you doubt that this was a great book and series. 
 To all who have not had the pleasure of reading Richelle Mead stop the torture and get your self to a bookstore or Library and enjoy what a book should be ....an escape

4,"Four stars. I really liked it but I didn't love it. Maybe because Hailey and Matt were just such nice people? 
 Hailey and her ex-husband run a business call Fetch which does exactly that for wealthy individuals. From 4 am cheesecake orders to nappy deliveries to buying an entire apartment's full of furniture for a recently divorced client. Nothing is too much trouble or out of hours. 
 As co-owner Hailey looks after their very special or very difficult clients - and she has one of each. The special client Sniper87 MIGHT be her favourite hockey player Matt Eriksson, but she is too professional to break her client's request for confidentiality and look at his personal details, even though she has every right as the co-owner. The difficult client likes to send dick picks to illustrate every request he makes, many of which are for sex-related items. 
 After her favourite client messages her to complain that the dog-walker sent by the service she recommended walked round his apartment taking pictures and fondling things (!!), Hailey agrees to find a staff member to walk Rufus for Sniper87, but decides to do it herself. 
 Matt Eriksson is a divorcee and a father of five year old twins. His ex-wife Tara hated hockey and spent their entire marriage complaining about everything Matt did and didn't do, things haven't changed much since his divorce and at 30 years old he feels like a veteran compared to some of the young kids on his team. Trouble is, at his age, he doesn't want one-night stands and hook-ups with puck-bunnies. The one thing he enjoys is the online chat with THE (or Hottie as he thinks of her), the person who answers 90% of his Fetch requests. The two of them have a great rapport and he wonders if they could take it further. When he watches the security video of the latest person to walk his dog Rufus he is struck by the looks of the young woman he sees and wonders if she could be Hottie. 
 There are plots involving Matt's ex-wife and Hailey's ex-husband but they are the normal kind of dramas that can be expected when you are still connected to your ex, nothing outlandish or unbelievable. Oh and we get more of the WAGs and Wesmie, so that was nice. 
 There is just one thing that felt off to me. (view spoiler)[Hailey finds out something about Matt's ex-wife through her analysis of Fetch's client data for a potential expansion of the business. Despite her protestations about client confidentiality in relation to the identity of Sniper87, she feels no such aversion to telling Matt what she found. Not once does she think that she is breaching that client's confidentiality. (hide spoiler)] 
 However, maybe if this had been written by anyone other than the incomparable Elle Kennedy and Sarina Bowan I would have rated this higher - these ladies just set the bar so flippin' high."
4,"I found this book a lot easier to get into than The Iron King. Without all the introductory, mysterious ""what's going on?!"" set-up stuff, the story got going a lot quicker and moved faster without so many fae-creature introduction thrown in there too. Meghan is finding her footing in NeverNever, getting to grips with who she is and the role she finds herself playing, because really she is once again forced into circumstances without any real choice. She cares so deeply, what else can she do when those she loves need her? I'm looking forward to seeing how the (really quite big, not at all subtle) hints in this book work out in the next."
3,"Read 4 Review: 
 I received a copy of Brenda St. John Brown's Swimming to Tokyo from the group Never too old to read Y.A & N.A. books. In turn, I will give an honest review of the book. This post will be cross posted to GoodReads, my blog, and Barnes and Noble's page for the book. 
 Overall, I gave the book a solid 3 stars with GoodRead's star ratings, but personally I'd give it more of a 3.5. Once I started reading, the book I didn't want to put it down. It was intriguing, and it was refreshing to see how these characters seemed ""broken"" to themselves, but couldn't see what others saw of themselves. To me that kind of made the book more realistic. 
 Zosia and Finn went to the same high school, but she only had a crush on him from afar. He was a loner, she was popular. They haven't crossed paths until the eve of Zosia leaving for Tokyo for her father's job. Once they ""reconnected"" I kind of figured there'd be a lot more to them once they arrived in Tokyo. What started out as a friendship between two similar aged teens, turns into more when they both realize that together they are better than they are alone. 
 I also enjoyed the research Ms. St. John Brown put into the story. Knowing about the different areas of Tokyo, and the trains kind of made me feel like I was there with Zosia (side note, ever since HBO's Girl's became popular, I see the name Zosia and think of Zosia Mamet and I had her face in mind every time I saw the name. Not that it is bad thing. I just kind of like creating an image of a book characters on my own, and not because a name makes me think of someone.) 
 I also know I would have rated this higher if there had been some better editing. A couple times towards the end of the book, there were some missing words in sentences, and throughout the whole book I noticed missing quotation marks or conversations from two different characters placed on the same line and at times that made it confusing as to: was Zosia saying it or was Finn? 
 While I breezed through the book, I also thought a lot happened in the last 80 or so pages. The first part of the book wasn't slow I do think something more could have been added in. 
 Also this book made me cry. So if the loss of a loved one gets to you, make sure you have tissues handy. 
 Would I recommend this book to others? Yes, I would I would tell them that this is a nice quick read. (If this was summertime this is the book I would have been reading on the beach and I don't think that is a bad thing either, it's just one of those that you'd want to read while sitting in a beach chair sipping a lovely drink). 
 Overall, I really enjoyed Zosia and Finn's story of their summer in Tokyo. They got to experience amazing things in a completely different culture and that summer helped both characters move on from different circumstances in life."
4,"Yeah! A book that can stand on its own! It just seems that there are so many young adult books written nowadays that are part of a series. And, it was also clean - only one little scene that got mildly steamy, which was nice for a young adult book. Well with that being said, this was a refreshing novel about a young love so new and unexpected. After being thrown together to work on an English project, Jaden McEntyre - a superior academic student trying to save the world, and Parker Whelan - the epitomy of a motorcycle badboy with that brooding sexual confidence, become friends. Jaden already has a boyfriend, and is not looking for a relationship with the mysterious Parker, but she just can't help herself. After two months of working on their English project together, there's something between the pair. Jaden's main plan after high school is to get into the college of her dreams, Harvard. As time goes by while still working with Parker on their English project, which includes reading and interpreting the literature classic Ethan Frome written by Edith Wharton, their relationship takes on a whole new dimension, and her life's plan might not be in her future. Her friends just don't understand her interest in him. He's a loner - sitting outside eating his lunch and not bothering with anyone else in school. Jaden insists, though, that she's just hanging out with him because of their English project. But as their time together increases, she finds herself sneaking around to be with Parker - wanting more privacy, and, making up all kinds of excuses not to be with her boyfriend, Blake. The discussions between the two concerning Ethan Frome, become more intimate - more personal. Jaden just doesn't know what it is about Parker that she's so attracted to, but she does know that she can't stop thinking about him. He just smells soooo goood! And he has such an amazing smile - that is, when he decides to smile. And whenever she thinks about the guy she gets all warm and cozy with butterflys in her stomach! What will she do as her feelings for him intensify? And, does he feel the same way about her? This novel kept my attention the whole time - wanting to find out what happens in the end. Does the heroine end up with the good boy (Blake) or the bad boy (Parker)? In fact, I was totally blind-sided when I read the ending. Did not see that coming at all! So, it's totally different than what you think is going to happen; at least for me it was. Applause for Ms. Klein for pulling that off!!! I really enjoyed the two young adults. Jaden is so confident about what she wants and is always willing to help - the stellar student, everybody's best friend. Parker is the dark guy in the distance - watching everybody intensely, secretly listening. This was a sweet and tender romance concentrating on two young adults trying to find the path to their future, while stumbling upon a love so rarely possible at such a young age. Definitely worth a look!"
4,"So it's like a... you jump, I jump, Jack and Rose kind of thing? 
 No. you jump... and i'll be there to catch you"
5,"FANTASTIC book!!! I loved the part of the narrator, it totally makes the whole book. I love Edward, Jane and G as well. It was written so wonderfully and I loved the shape shifting that happens in this book. Was such a great story. Some was true to the actual history but the narrator lets you know when history ends and the fiction begins. I am sad that in real life Lady Jane is beheaded after 9 days of being queen but love how they made her fictionally alive and happy. Fun book and so easy to read. I never wanted it to end."
2,"I enjoyed some parts of this very much, but the whole of it was a little disappointing; it is a story with a moral message and judges the characters rather than simply showing them. 
 (view spoiler)[ 
 The novel centres all on Madame Wu and her choices; the rest of the family is there to show whether or not she is doing well or ill -- and really that is the crux of what I did not like in the book, it is all a judgement upon Madame Wu's choices. I loved that it began with her withdrawing herself from sexual life with her husband to live a life of the spirit and mind, and I loved that it showed her callous brutality in buying a girl to be her husband's concubine, and the way Buck did not back down both from the fact that this was rape, and also from the fact that Madame Wu was not a person who could initially understand the wrong of it. The parts about her growing understanding of consent and personhood were fascinating, and I liked (and identified with) her struggles around responsibility and freedom. 
 But then, oh, Brother Andre is introduced, and suddenly it becomes a book about the Simple Yet Wise White Man teaching the Smart But Ignorant Chinese Woman true morality, and the fact that he does not overtly teach but merely lives beautifully does not change it, nor does the fact that I agreed with some of his moral teachings. It changes the book so that it is really about how she is wrong and learns to be 'right' which is annoying. I wanted a dense, layered novel that looks at all the different ways women might live in a Chinese compound, the family and the servants, the wise matriarch and the young wives with their more Western educations, all the clash brought about by the ideas of companionate marriage and women's equality and technological change and the tension between the push to Westernise and the push to conserve -- that would have been a fascinating book. Instead it is all a moral lesson, and thus very, very disappointing.

4,"4 STARS 
 LOLWUT. 
 I may liked this. Yes, as in a bit swoony over Marcus. I was never a fan of love triangle story, but this one was a very good love triangle, so I just had to make an exception for this one. For Marcus. Okay, you've heard me. 
 Asia was not your typical girl in the story, she's a tomboy, she likes to surf, she likes to smoke weed along with her brother, she mostly friends with guys because of her upbringing not because she's a bitch. So when two guys were vying for her attentions, she's not sure how to do with them, even with herself. 
 Jay. He's your typical alpha male, dominant, protective and came from fortune. But he's trying to change her into something that's not her. Even if she kind of likes it at first. 
 Marcus, bad boy for life. He's been best friends with her older brother, Shaun almost all his life. She knows him since she's still a kid, she had a huge crush for him when she's a teenager. They had history together. But he broke her heart and left her. 
 And now both men, came to her life at the same time. Can she choose between those two different men? Can she free herself? 
 This story isn't only looking for romance, but it's more about self-discovery. I love Asia, she's strong, sexy, tough, sweet and with a hint of girl-next-door type. There were amazing and scorching hot steamy scenes, there were humours, friendship, family and great romance. 
 I highly recommend this book for those who like love triangle story."
5,"At 1%: This is the second year of my Dickens in December project. 
 At 10%: Dickens is simply brilliant, and the names of his characters are so fun. 
 At 25.0%: What a page turner of a read this one is turning out to be. 
 At 32.0%: Such wit and on point critiques of people and society. Too bad Dickens isn't alive to write about our times. 
 At 46.0%: Almost at the halfway mark, and it just keeps getting better. 
 At 55.0%: Distracted by holiday travels, but back in the swing of things, only to find myself delighted by an incidence of spontaneous combustion. 
 At 75.0%: And now we have a murder mystery thrown into the mix? Oh, Dickens, how I adore thee. 
 I read some Dickens in school, and while I recall liking them, I think I was more impressed with myself for reading him than his actual writing. So to rectify that, and to get to the rest of his oeuvre, I decided in 2015 to start an annual tradition of 'Dickens in December'. 2016 was year two of the new tradition, and I decided to go with what is widely considered his masterpiece. What with holiday travel, etc. I didn't end up completely the book until early January, but I'm not complaining. 
 I listened to the audiobook, and was enthralled for the entire 33 hours or so it took to get through this masterpiece. I loved everything about it. The wit, the social and judicial critiques, the character development and their individual voices, the plot, the numerous tangents, the wonderful names of people and places, oh, I could go on and on. This is a classic for a reason, and I don't think I need to summarize the story, for indeed how could I? The wonder of this master craftsman is that whenever he took me on a tangent, I waited with delight to see where we'd end up. In the end you realize that there is a reason for each and every sentence, each scene, and each item that we are shown. There is not a wasted sentence in my opinion, and all those nay-sayers who say he wrote such wordy tomes because he got paid by the word can go suck on a lemon. I wanted more, and would happily have read a book twice this size. I had a severe book hangover when I was done, for who on earth could even hope to keep my interest after Dickens? 
 A note on the audiobook production. The book was narrated by the wonderful Simon Vance, and his ability to keep the numerous character voices straight is incredible. The narration is superb and only added to my delightful experience. I'd highly recommend the audio version of this one. 
 I could not put this book down, and when I had to, I found myself thinking about the characters and saying things they would say. It surely is an East Wind I feel now that I have to wait until December to read my next Dickens. Which one will it be?"
5,"** spoiler alert ** 
 I kept going back and forth between 4 and 5 stars with this one so I settled with 4.5 stars. Fish and Chip is the third installment of the Cut and Run series. 
 This book grabbed my attention instantly. Ty and Zane were assigned a case on a cruise ship where they had to portray an openly gay married couple. Ty impersonated Del Porter, who is fun-loving, spirited, and on the submissive side. Not exactly Ty's personality. I kind of thought he could have a smidgen of this in him though. Zane, who impersonated Corbin Porter is a possessive, jealous, hard-nose business man. I loved this story line. It allowed Ty and Zane to be open with each other and also bring their emotions to the forefront. 
 As usual, there was also a lot of humor. I loved Zane calling Ty ""Doll"" and when Ty found Del's toys, classic moment. I could go on and on about these two. 
 Both men struggled to find the line between what they were actually feeling and what were Del/Corbin's feelings. These lines got blurred as they had to come to terms with what they felt. They both had to face their insecurities and fears. 
 They became extremely intimate during this case. This is by far the most passionate of the books so far. As they begin to realize their feelings for one-another, the sex is not just about a quick fix. It's HOT but also it pulls at your heartstrings because you can feel their emotions up front. Sex has never been a huge part of these books but I found after the opening of this one, I couldn't get enough, which is a first for me. I typically think there's always too much sex but in this series I find myself saying ""DAMN why didn't we see that!"" 
 Ty finally admits he loves Zane and for me it came out at the perfect time. I knew Zane has always had a hard time coming to terms with his feelings for Ty even though he does love him. I really thought that once Ty admitted his feelings, Zane would have been able to come to terms with his. My heart went out to Ty when Zane didn't completely reciprocate his feelings. Although, it was frustrating that Ty wasn't able to see through Zane's facade and see how much he really loves him. He usually can read Zane so well. This was one of the issues that bothered me in the book. I was hoping that Ty would at least see that it's Zane's fears that are in the way and that it wasn't that Zane didn't love him. 
 Also, I think the book ended way too soon. After the big ""I Love You"", they talk about it briefly, in a jail cell and then just go on with their lives and we see nothing. And why the hell didn't Zane give Ty the necklace he bought him? I really hope it's going to be saved for a ""perfect"" moment because I was hoping that moment would have been in this book. At least Zane didn't put his wedding ring back on. I wish we saw Ty noticing that. 
 I did enjoy the mystery for the most part even though some things did bother me about the case. For one, Ty and Zane didn't know who their back team was (makes no sense), they didn't have any way to contact their superiors or anyone on their team and the explanation of the killers at the end seemed a bit anti-climatic after all they went through on the ship. As always the relationship aspect of the book was top notch. 
 I have to admit I'm a little nervous about the next book, Divide & Conquer which has a cover of a broken piggy with a bandage. This doesn't sound too promising for Ty and Zane. I don't want anything dividing these boys especially after the big step they took in this book."
5,"This book had it all. 
 Humor. Romance. Heartbreak. Drama. Lots of it. Hollywood style. 
 What shone through the most, however, were the true-to-life feelings 
 it evoked. The emotional affliction felt real and heartfelt as the 
 quirky couple we fell in love with fight to stay together. 
 ********************** 
 This has been one of my favorite series, first off, because Alice Clayton wrote it and every book she's written has been pure gold. Secondly, because since the beginning, she adeptly mixed romance, playfulness, seductiveness and humor in just the right amounts to deliver a well-crafted, well-balanced story that is truly heartfelt. This last installment in the Redhead series followed the same trajectory, but this time, the experience felt deeper. The author amped up the drama and emotion while she softened the humor a touch. It was still undeniably Jack and Grace with their endearing wit and sweetness, but the story felt more meaningful, the problems felt real despite the surrealism of Hollywood, from which the drama was rooted. In my opinion, this was a slightly more serious Alice Clayton and I found myself really feeling the sadness, heartbreak and angst. I thought it was a great conclusion to the series as Grace and Jack struggle to define who they are, who they want to be, and what they are willing to lose when all bets are off and the choices they make can forever change their future. 
 Jack's career is skyrocketing. After the huge success of TIME, he's in hot demand, lusted over by fans, directors, producers alike. With Holly's strategic direction shepherding his next move, he's chosen a gritty war movie as his next project. Meanwhile, Grace is getting ready to begin shooting her new TV show and truly, it seemed life couldn't be better. Gracie and George were happy. 
 With Holly dictating his every move, emboldened fans accosting him constantly and the rising frustration at not being able to go public with his relationship with Grace, Jack begins to break as the pressure mounts. In addition, he begins to deal with his tumultuous emotions by going out and drinking himself into a stupor. 
 ""As I worked, Jack played. Sure, he spent his days on the set filming, but he spent his nights out on the town. And then his days sleeping it off. He was young, and this town laid itself out for him. Clubs were packed to capacity on the nights he was in attendance, and the photographers were out in full force."" 
 Being the young Hollywood actor he is, Grace dismisses his behavior as a way to let loose and blow off steam, ignoring that gut feeling that something could be wrong. At the same time, Grace is put under some pressure too. Producers of her new show feel that she's a little too heavy for the role. 
 ""The exact note is: 'We need her to have a little more cheekbone, a little more jawline."" 
 So Grace goes full speed ahead on Operation Cheekbone. Sucking down as much non-caloric air as she can and clocking as many hours at the gym as humanly possible, Grace swallows her pride and gets to work in order to achieve her dream. In addition, as if the weight situation wasn't enough, Jack's fans continue to antagonize her, constantly mentioning her more mature status in every single article publicized. 
 One of the notions this book explores in very sharp focus is the price of fame. Both Grace and Jack fight their raging feelings in an environment that constantly pushes and pushes and pushes. Whether it be the blinding lights and incessant clicking of camera shutters or the carefully orchestrated outings and the strict directions on what to do, what to say and where to go every minute of every day, it's all too overwhelming, especially for a 24-year-old who detests the limelight. 
 I imagine some might debate on whether Jack succumbed to the pressures of stardom too easily, but I think the point is that people handle things differently and in this case, whether it's a result of his youth or his persona, it was simply too much to handle. Jack became someone else entirely and his choices threatened to split Grace and him up permanently, that is, if he didn't do damage to himself first. Fueled by a ""friend"" with perhaps insidious intent, Jack's life spirals out of control. He refuses to see it, blinded by his own frustrations and dispelling any concerns. 
 ""Don't worry about a prat like me. I'm fine...."" 
 ""I wish I could believe you, George..."" 
 ""I wish you could too."" 
 There are moments that are so heartbreaking, that I really felt Grace's helplessness, Jack's frustration that threatened to explode, their inability to reach each other and the sadness I felt seeing something so good fall apart. But in order for them to reach their happily ever after, they both needed to evolve. Grace needed to do some growing up of her own, gaining the confidence to be herself regardless of the circumstances... regardless of what others say. Regardless, despite the intensity of their issues, there are absolutely moments that are happy and funny and normal and I simply reveled in those instances. I particularly loved Grace's inner musings. 
 ""In this moment, in this car, on this stretch of highway, we were a couple in love. We were not an older woman and a younger man, Jack wasn't the Sexiest Man Alive, but he was the sexiest man in my world. I wasn't an up-and-coming actress who'd been asked about the size of her boyfriend's dick the night before by a total stranger, I was a girl in a convertible in my pajamas, holding hands with the man I was in love with."" 
 Overall, I loved this book. Loved that it made me feel so much. Loved these characters. Loved the witty and sweet exchanges. And in the end, loved the way it ended. LOVED. I can't wait to see what new kind of ""crazy"" Alice Clayton comes up with next in the first book in the Cocktail series, Rusty Nailed, coming out summer of next year!

5,"Touching, sometimes horrifying, usually portraits of children in startling situations with realistic responses."
5,"What an amazing book. I really like when mythology is used properly in a story, when the author respects the original stories and at the same time puts their own spin on it. It is nice to read another great book on Egyptian myths."
5,Best ending! I was a bit sad with some of the deaths.. but I guess that comes with most good book series. I cannot wait for the prequel this summer!
5,"Soulless is exactly the paranormal historical fiction book I didn't know I was waiting for. 
 Alexia Tarabotti is smart, fashionable, and unwilling to bend herself and her personality to the rules of society. Her power is interesting and helps to define her, without being the only reason for her involvement in the book's various plotlines. 
 The setting is an alternative Victorian Britain, where supernatural creatures (vampires, werewolves, and ghosts) are an accepted part of society and are a large factor in Britain's rise to power. I love paranormal stories where the vampires, werewolves, etc. are integrating/integrated into society. I like seeing how the author deals with it, and how the world reacts. So, score another big point for this series. 
 Even the names, vocabulary and phrasing got me. I found myself grinning or laughing outright at the book so many times! 
 Most importantly for me, this book completely sidestepped the biggest problem I have with paranormal series: the yo-yo-ing between multiple love interests. It's obvious to the reader very early on where the romance side is heading, but it's sooooo, so enjoyable watching it get there! There are plenty of steamy bits without it ever being skanky (another thing I dislike about a lot of other series) and as the story progresses you get a bit of both characters' views on viewpoint on the matter. This is supremely enjoyable. I really thought the omniscient perspective was used in all the right places, with all the right characters. 
 Speaking of characters, I really LIKED Alexia and Lord Maccon... but the story was rounded out by how fun the side characters are. Lord Akeldama, Professor Lyall, and even Floote the butler! 
 It all just comes together to make a fantastic Julie book. 
 Ahhhhh, I cannot WAIT for book two."
3,"Beware of spoilers 
 An alternate world set after the ""Other Wars"" (Others being vampires, werewolves, demons, etc) the public is not only aware of their existence, but ""wards"" (magical symbols and charms used to protect people) are common place, and come standard innew cars. Anyone who is half-blood or a magic welder must be registered with the SOF (Special Other Forces), whose job is to track down and destroy the Others. 
 Rae ""Sunshine"" Seddon is in her mid-twenties and is, for the most part, happy to spend her time baking cinnamon rolls in her mom and step-fathers restaurant, reading everything she can about the Others. Until one night she goes for a drive and is kidnapped by vampires. She is locked in an abandoned house with one other prisoner; a vampire named Constantine. From that day forward her life changes so rapidly in ways she couldn't have ever dreamed, and she learns that there is a lot more going on in the world than she ever knew. A mix of vampire horror, magic and sarcasm, it's a new way of seeing what the world would be like withvampires. 
 One of the reviews on the back cover says that fans of Buffy will love this book, and that's very true; Sunshine has Buffy's sarcastic tone, and there is the same mix of action, wit and magic that keep it interesting. Sunshine is a little hard to follow in the beginning; the author talks about the Other Wars like the reader was there, and continually mentions things (a ""combox"" is a computer, for instance) without actually explaining them. As a result, the first 1/3 of the book feels like you're being dragged along, grabbing random bits of information as you try to keep up. 
 After the initial learning curve, you start to follow, and do get sucked in. McKinley's assumption that you'll figure it out does allow you to become more engrossed in the world she's created, but you have to wonder what information (or cool things) you might be missing out on. 
 The plot is constantly moving forward, and isn't predictable (in a good way). There's enough action to keep you going, but it has calm periods in between that explain what Sunshine is learning and a little more about the world she lives in. My only other complaint is you learn just enough about the supporting characters to become intrigued with them, and enough to make you want to know what their deal is, but you never find out. The only character you really learn about is Sunshine. 
 It's an intriguing book, but it may make you wish there was an insiders guide so you could get a little more out of it. Be warned, there is a sex scene in the middle, but something to keep in mind."
3,3.5 stars. This reminded me a lot of Rosemarie Clement-Moore's trilogy (Highway to Hell and so on) with a similarly clever and snarky heroine and some wacky demon stuff. I liked Rosemarie's a lot more though- the humor was a bit more spot on and the plot more complex and intriguing. This was still a fun read though and I have to say my only big disappointment (as a librarian myself) was that the evil librarian was a bit lame and not as entertaining as I thought he would be.
5,"Oh My Gosh. This book. I loved it. I went from laughing on one pages, to blushing the next, to being scared out of my wits. And Noah Shaw. Can I have one? But that ending. *dies* I need the next book."
4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 I totally love this book though there are some points that I wish that it just ended there. My rating 4.5 out of 5, I describe Sam as the perfect boyfriend so sweet and would do anything for her girl as for Grace I describe her as the over protective girlfriend. Well who wouldn't? One day you just found out that the wolf thats looking out for you and the one you're constantly looking at has turned to be a man and is your soulmate what else is there to do? well obviously to protect him from being that wolf again. The ending is just too predictable cause just like a story would end or atleast most of the books that i've read its that it turns to be a happy ending and so is the book, its just too predictable. Looking forward on reading the sequel Linger :)"
5,"OH MY WOW! So this book has been on my to be read list forever, there just wasn't an urgency. But I so wish I had read it earlier. 
 I started listening while doing housework during the day. I had to run to the library tonight to get a hard copy because the audio version was just to slow and the kids wern't being quiet enough for me to hear. I really didn't want to put this one down. There was a mystery to it and I was pretty sure I had it figured out early on but there was just enough to doubt that I was right. However I didn't guess the last twist. Great job Ms. Revis. I will be picking up the next book as soon as I can!"
4,"Oy vey. 
 A.J. is a badass drummer and has been giving sweet Chloe crap since the moment they met. Committed to nice guy cop Eric, Chloe can't understand why AJ is so darn mean. 
 Thrown together because of their friends' wedding, AJ lowers his guard and let's Chloe in. The fallout from their chemistry, the nice guy cop's exit, and what turns out to be AJ's unbelievably horrific past is where the fight between pain and true love comes in. NO CHEATING. 
 I usually eye-roll at most damaged romantic heroes; however, the damage that comes with AJ is insurmountable or almost so. As horrible as his past is, I am sure that in reality it is more than just a possibility given the state of some human nature. 
 Lots of angst, some unrealistic scenarios, but bottom line you have a pretty spunky heroine and a damaged hero who begins as an ass-hat extradonnaire and reveals himself to be one hunk of a damaged hero ready and wiling to martyr himself for the girl he loves. The sex scenes, while sparse compared to a lot of similar books, are incendiary. 
 There is more than a whiff of YA, but the characters are strong enough and cool enough to stamp that crap down. 
 Sidenote: Chloe has a set of uber snotty parents. Happily, we find out (view spoiler)[ that her dad was a badass Irish mafia wannabee that smartened up enough to cacth Chloe's upper crust mother. His sharkish approval of AJ's more brutal moments was entertaining 
 (hide spoiler)]"
4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 Why was I surprised that this book was such a bummer? A 9th grader recommended this to me (albeit long after Megan already had) and I enjoyed it; I like that the book took the protagonist to task over objectifying Alaska, though her own feminist rants felt a bit canned to me. Still, any book that has a main character who is proud of being a feminist AND celebrates that character in an honest and nuanced way? Big win, John Green. Hooray."
5,"'No Pants Required' by Kim Karr is the perfect summertime read! This absolutely fun and light hearted romantic comedy will completely whisk you away with its' witty and charming characters, laugh out loud moments, and sizzling escapades. I highly recommend you grab your favorite libation, prop up your feet, and dive right into this deliciously sweet and sexy summer read! 
 I would just like to start by saying that I just absolutely adored the characters in this book! 
 Makayla had such an intriguing and quirky personality, and I absolutely loved her inner dialogue. I also really admired that along with her insecurities, she also had great strength and confidence in trying to overcome them. It was quite surprising to me that she had so much sexual confidence, but that's one of the many things that made her relationship with Camden spontaneous and super-hot! Oh, and did I mention her checklist for finding her old self and how fantastic it was? Believe me, this isn't your ordinary checklist that I am speaking of, and Makayla showed great determination and courage in completing it to prove to herself that she could be the spontaneous person she once was! 
 I loved how Camden was strong and steadfast in his beliefs, although he struggled with his anger from his past issues and goals regarding his career. It made him more real and genuine, and it was very refreshing that he was so trustworthy and not wish-washy in his feelings for Makayla. He was so incredibly sweet, playful, and spontaneous which made his character even more charming, sexy, and totally dream worthy! 
 I also appreciated Makayla's and Camden's patience and respect for each other as they worked through their individual struggles within themselves. It ultimately allowed them to build a strong foundation of friendship with each other. Together, their passion was incredible and they made such a fun loving and absolutely adorable couple! 
 Kim Karr has such an impeccable ability in creating heartfelt and true to life characters and weaving them into unique storylines that consume you from beginning to end. The story moved along at a nice and steady pace, and combined with the beach setting made for a very refreshing romance. This is such a fun and enjoyable story that makes for the perfect summer reading escape! 
 *** 5 Stars for me!!*** 
 *** ARC kindly provided by the author in exchange for an honest review ***"
5,AMOS BURTON IS AMAZING. I have really come to love these characters more and more in each book. Someone compared them to the characters of Firefly and I kinda have to agree. This is the book that is from the perspective of the Scientist.
1,"Yeah, I didn't like this book. 
 Read the review on http://pandaheartsbooks.wordpress.com/"
2,Not my cup of tea. I'm just glad that I was able to finish it.
4,"And now, I can finally read Blood-Kissed Sky 
 I checked t out weeks ago, but found out later that it was book 2 so I got Darkness Before Dawn and was satisfied with it. 
 I like the connection between Dawn and Victor. The story kept me hooked and I would have wondered who the stalker was if I hadn't started book 2 first by accident. 
 So, I want to like Michael, but his insecurities bothered me so much, they weren't even about their relationship, they were about himself not feeling that he was macho enough."
3,"3.5 - cute, but even the characters are making jokes about the series premise at this point. Also, it felt like there was filler-sex scenes I would have rather hung out more with the characters getting to know one another."
5,"1984 was one of those novels that say on my mental shelf of books needing to be read at some point in my literary life. I had honestly very little insight as to what it was, but was under the impression that it had become a classic, and therefore, had to be read in accordance to my morals. Thankfully, my dear friend and sister, was there to assist my in reading this book. In other words, she forced me to read it, all in good faith. 
 There is absolutely nothing wrong with being forced to read a classic because, as we see in this George Orwell novel, you are hardly ever disappointed. 
 1984 is the novel that introduces the most frightening world one could ever imagine. And yes, no matter what you may believe, I know that this is entirely possible. This dystopia is not a fictitious idea we can avoid, and if you look with just an ounce of effort you can see a example of it in today's society. A world where there is power, you are loyal to the government, you do not freely think, and you are not an individual. You are a part of a machine that works the way the government says it must work. Think against the government and you vanish. 
 The book is written well on all fronts, but it's the plot that really caught me. It was terrifying, it instilled hope, but then betrayed me. I finished the book feeling extremely glad to have read it, thinking it an excellent book, but also frozen with its depressive reality and absoluteness."
4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 I really felt sorry for Balthazar. I was so glad when Lucas and Bianca broke up because I really wanted her to end up with Balthazar. But of course I know that that would never happen since the main couple here are Bianca and Lucas. :( 
 I pity Balthazar even more when his sister Charity turned against him. He had been searching for her for so long, and when he finally found her, she didn't want to join him anymore. 
 I liked how the author made some twists in Bianca's life, making her part-wraith somehow."
4,"So, this is the second Murakami that I've read and I have to say that I really enjoyed it. The premise and the imagery and the writing and... just all of it... really came together for me. I wouldn't say that any of it 'hit me' (I don't think Murakami goes for that kind of thing) but the realizations and impacts keep washing over me in waves. 
 This one gives me hope that I can get into Murakami more going forward. I might update this review, as well, as my impressions really sink in, since I just finished it and these are my initial thoughts."
3,Surprisingly good...But...We will have to see how it goes....
2,"This book has no plot and all the characters are unrealistic. The narrator although through other people's word kept telling us how kind he was. I never found someone so pretentious like Toru. I would have never finished the book if it was not part of reading for a book club. Other reason I finished it is just to know what others found so great in this book. In every review, I read before starting I found a common line saying the end is so beautiful. I found it worst. The entire book contains only unnecessary sex descriptions and details of their organ . The female characters are so weak and dependent. Mr. Haruki, you failed to create a single female character. I do not know whether it is the translation or what. The dialogues were so poorly written. Even at the end why on earth, a man who was mourning for his departed girlfriend was having sex with his girlfriend's comforter. Can anyone explain it? I gave it two stars just for one line in the book which actually defines the book itself. ""'If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking.'""- This is absolute truth for this book too. Only because everyone is reading it do not read a book and just because everyone is thinking it good does not necessary mean the book will be good."
3,"ARC provided through NetGalley for an honest review 
 Ford and Ruby were best friends during college, never letting things go beyond a sister/brother type relationship, until their last night together when they kissed. Eight years later, they are about to see each other again for New Years Eve, and their best friends, Emma and Niall's, wedding. 
 Once they see each other again its on... 
 This was a cute novella. I'm not a big fan of them, but it worked for what it was."
5,"This is a book to be savored. I think I found this one recommended when I searched for more books like Georgette Heyer, and this does have a very satisfying romance and takes place during the Regency era, but it is so much more than a Regency romance. Anna's growth from sheltered child into confident woman is beautiful. As the daughter of a classical musician, I found the musical details accurate and interesting. When she and Henry are reunited, the slow burn development of their marriage is beautiful to read. This book isn't really like Persuasion, but it shares a lot of common themes (the difference between infatuation in youth and mature love, contrasting the discipline of naval life with the self-indulgence of lazy aristocracy, family dynamics in close-knit society where everyone knows everyone else's business). Poignant, well-written, wonderful."
3,Interesting wrap up to the series. It's not as good as Uglies but it isn't as tough to read as Pretties. I think that is because Tally is a little more in control of her mind but the interesting narrator of Uglies was destroyed with her surge in Pretties.
3,"Gym Reading, aka ""I got it free for my Kindle."" This is a romance story. No more, no less. The premise is pretty shaky. The characters annoyed me. It always annoys me when there's SOME BIG SECRET that the main character should just fess up to, but doesn't. But sometimes, I get it. There's a reason Kari never told her daughter and it makes sense. But when Max is back in her life, she needed to tell her. And for a bit there, it just couldn't happen due to LIFE. But there's one point where she says she just doesn't have a chance, then THREE DAYS OF NOTHING go by and she takes her daughter to spend the weekend with Max's family and still doesn't tell her. Really? Her best friend was able to see that Max was the daughter just from a picture, and you don't think Max's fam's going to be able to see it from a weekend?? Her quick turn around (when she left the bar) in the end also came out of nowhere. It jut didn't make sense. 
 In the end, I gave this three stars because I did enjoy reading it, but there are a LOT of problems."
5,"This and other reviews can be found on The Psychotic Nerd 
 MY THOUGHTS 
 I loved The Madman's Daughter! Her Dark Curiosity was a bit of a letdown, but this book most certainly wasn't! 
 On the run, Juliet, Montgomery, Lucy, Edward (who is deathly ill), and Balthazar, make it to a very remote Scottish home (thanks to Elizabeth von Stein). But both the home and Elizabeth's family have secrets. Shown by the secret passages, the servants with non-matching appendages, and a creepy little boy. When Juliet finds out about the experiments going on in the house, she has to fight whether she wants to continue into her father's footsteps. 
 What I really like about this series is how each book is a retelling of classic gothic literature, yet all of the books are connected and have the same characters! And I am still able to see how it connects to the original story! 
 Juliet is such a complex character and she goes through so much character growth throughout this series. I had issues with her in the first two book, mostly due to the romance, and she still has her flaws, but I actually liked how this book addressed those flaws. In this book, she struggles with the fact that she actually liked killing those men in the last book. She also struggles with the idea that she might be becoming her father, by doing these experiments and playing god. She learns so much throughout this series and especially in this book! It makes me so sad how she has to learn, but I am so proud of how strong she has become. 
 There is romance in this book and it really takes a backseat in this book. I am quite happy about the romance in this book! There is no more love triangle (as Edward is dying and Juliet is now engaged to Montgomery), so there is no more annoying back and forth between men! Doesn't mean everything is all happy and dandy. Juliet and Montgomery do have to work things out in this book and it is very heartbreaking seeing them fight at all, but it is all part of Juliet discovering herself and I am satisfied with the ending. 
 IN CONCLUSION 
 I adore this series and I am sad to see it go! This book was dark, like the others, but it was even more tragic. Really, if you want to read an amazing gothic retelling series, this is the series to pick up! Now I am highly anticipating Megan Shepherd's next book, The Cage!"
3,"Better than the first book, but you could see the plot coming a mile away. Not surprisingly, the same problems (present-tense style, insecure character) repeat themselves here."
4,"Usually when I review a book I try to allot the stars not by the audiobook's narration but by the author's words and content. With this book I am awarding four stars but it is partially due to Kate Winslet's fantastic narration. She is as you must know a famous actress. I strongly believe I would never have been able to imagine the words with the terror and emotion evoked through her reading. She does a fantastic job. In addition, I would have been furious if at every mention of Camille's name it had been improperly pronounced. All the French streets and terms are spot-on; this is an important part of drawing the downtrodden life in the poorer, less affluent areas of Paris where the story unfolds in the latter 1800s. 
 You are told in the book description that Laurent and Therese kill Camille, Therese's husband and cousin. It is what happens afterwards that constitutes the true story. This is a psychological drama, not a murder mystery. It is suspenseful, creepy and horrifying. Are you listening? It is horrifying!! At least when it is read by Kate Winslet. She notches up the suspense, the creepiness and the horror until you are sitting on the very edge of your seat. I haven't read a horror book in years; this has given me a good dose, enough to last for at least the next ten years. 
 In the book description we are also told that Zola ""... dispassionately dissects the motivations of his characters - mere 'human beasts', who kill in order to satisfy their lust..."" I disagree; there is nothing dispassionate about this book. It is all about emotions and passions, and please note the end of that sentence I quoted. It speaks of humans behaving as beasts, filled with lust. Now that gives the proper feeling of the book. 
 So read this book if you want a moving study of human emotions, of fear and guilt and what propels some of us to behave feverishly and crazily. Being a horror story, I at the same time find it a bit exaggerated. Not everybody behaves like this, but you get so pulled into the tension that you feel the agony of their guilt. And what about punishment? That is another question delved into. What is the worst punishment - that we allot ourselves or that forced upon us by others? Violence and abuse, which is harsher, the physical or the psychological? 
 I have read this is also a study of people with different temperaments. This didn't work for me. Therese's aunt, Camille's mother, is drawn as a sweet loving mother, but I see her as calculating! Laurent's temperament is clear. He is, at first at least, careful and prudent. He is calculating and egotistical, avaricious, just plain wicked. Therese, she is drawn as a passionate figure, and yet at the same time devious and secretive. Putting together those two characteristics does not work for me. Usually emotional, passionate people simply cannot hide what they are thinking or feeling. Perhaps under the stress of her evil deed she searches everywhere for absolution and escape. You have to read the story to see where it ends. 
 I do recommend it, but listen to the audiobook version narrated by Kate Winslet."
4,"An interesting ""reboot"" feel for the series, I like the resolution of the Mayor Tate mystery. I still don't quite understand the impetus behind the Evil Mallory plot line, but I like Merit's emotional reaction. Romantic frustration dropped this book in my estimation, however, as Merit and Ethan fall into old patterns. As much power and growth as Merit has displayed lately, Ethan comes across as the weak and indecisive half of the relationship (especially when compared to Jonah). Glad to be back in Chicagoland, looks like things are going to be heating up for book seven. Dare I hope more interaction with the gorgeous but temperamental Master Morgan?

5,"*May contain spoilers for Clockwork Angel* 
 I came off such a book high with Clockwork Angel I immediately had to pick up the second book, Clockwork Prince. I am completely and utterly addicted to this series and all of the characters. Clockwork Prince starts off exactly where Angel leaves off. The Magister has the pyxis, Nate has betrayed his sister and the Shadowhunters are about to be in the middle of a war. 
 Tessa Gray is such an amazing main character. I adored her in Clockwork Angel and I didn't think it would be possible to love her anymore. She is slowly starting to find herself while living with the Shadowhunters and realizing that it's not all about being proper when your amongst the Shadowhunters world. She wears her heart on her sleeve, although she does try not too and it's clear by the way all of the other characters adore her. Sophie played such a large part in Prince as well and I was excited to see that. I really warmed up to her in the first book and I was glad to see she had such a role in Clockwork Prince. Will & Jem... well I continue to love them more and more. I could keep talking about the characters for days honestly because the character development and building is just so great. Cassandra Clare is a master at creating these believable and lovable(and hateable!) people and the secondary characters are as strong as the main. 
 Clockwork Prince was a lot more fast paced then Angel in my opinion. In the first book, the characters were being developed and the story being told but in Prince we get so much more action. I love when the shadowhunters go to battle so I was happy to see it again! One thing I thoroughly enjoyed was that there wasn't a massive gap between where the first and second book left off. In a lot of trilogies or series I find that there is a sometimes months between the stories and you are expected to fill the gaps with what happened. That's not the case with The infernal Devices, which is great as we get to experience the full story. 
 There was quite a few surprises in the second installment. I was shocked by several of the things that happened and that also helped in keeping the pace and plot running. I also appreciated that we learned more about Will and his family and also learned about quite a few shadowhunters and downworlders. 
 Clockwork Prince definitely did not suffer from second book syndrome and it's made me even more excited to read Clockwork Princess! 100% recommend this!"
5,"If you loved The Hunger Games, you're gonna love Divergent. Veronica Roth takes you places, helps you escape and never let you go. She still succeeded in surprising me at some point, which is not an easy task to do. I cannot wait to read the sequel."
5,"Anyway, as long as there is oil in the Middle East we will never have peace. 
 I have a hard time rating memoirs... How can you say their life is x stars? 
 I love how unique this story is. I cannot say I've ever read a book like this before. Its a graphic novel and a memoir? Yes please! 
 Overall, I loved this book. It was engaging, enlightening, and it put us in a position we wouldn't have otherwise known. This book should be required reading for high school students, and I'm a little embarrassed I didn't read this sooner! 
 Also, Marjane is a badass! She is just fantastic. 
 Warning: Mini Rant Time 
 I, for one, love history!. I read history books. I've taken many, many history courses. I watch history documentaries and TV shows. BUT I KNOW NOTHING. 
 Its embarrassing how little of Middle Eastern history is covered in American classes (unless you take a course in college). There is a huge blind spot in the American curriculum. We cover American history, World History (usually a little bit of China's history, ancient Egypt, ancient Greek and Rome, but mostly European history.) All the while rich (and sometime tumultuous) cultures are misrepresented and largely ignored by the public."
4,"**4 Stars** 
 Like many people, I started reading the series after watching the show. I was pleasantly surprised, however, at how close the two are. There were very few changes from show to book. It is a very long book, and I actually wonder if I would have finished it if it had not been for the show. Don't get me wrong, I loved the book, but I wonder if part of that love came from watching the show first. 
 A Game of Thrones would have gotten a higher review from me, as I love the story, had it not been for a few things that fell short of expectations. I know that the book was originally published in 1996 and has had many reprintings since then (especially after the show came out). With that knowledge I did not expect the number of grammar flubs that I came across while reading. I would have thought they would have been edited out a long time ago. 
 I understand that in medieval times (and in high fantasy books) people did not live very long, so yes, they were married off at 12, 13, and 14. I do not think the ages would have bothered me as much had it not been for the sex scenes with 13- and 14-year-olds. Again, I understand this was the way it was done in medieval times, but it just felt awkward when reading a book that has recently been published. 
 All that aside, it is a fantastic story and George R.R. Martin has created a vast world that rivals Middle Earth. (Tolkien fans don't hate me - I'm a Tolkien fan as well). I am excited to continue the series and hope that Martin will be able to finish the series within the next few years."
4,"I could not put this book down! While reading it I couldn't focus on work or anybody, I only wanted to find out how my two darling boys were faring in this magical world full of vampires, dragons and Humdrums. This book made me laugh, and sigh (the dramatic ahw kind of sigh), and to be honest, almost cry at one point. It was everything and more of what I expected from Rowell. 
 I've been waiting for this book for a long time and finally, it is read. 
 Many of you may know how this book came to be - from Rowell's book FanGirl, but just in case you have no idea what I'm talking about, here is an explanation. In Rowells' book FanGirl her heroine was obsessed by a made up fantasy book franchise (something very much like Harry Potter) and she wrote gay fan fiction based on two characters from it. 
 Well. Rowell fell so much in love with the fan fiction that her fictional character was writing in her own fiction book, that she decided to bring it to life in it's own separate story. It's not, however, the actual fanfic from Fangirl written by Cath, but it's the story how it would be done if Rainbow Rowell wrote it. Not that complicated, right? 
 Anyhoo, this is Rowell's take on the classic ""chosen one"" story and she's done a really great job. While reading it I couldn't put it down and I was completely absolved by it. Give me magic, friendship and love and I'm hooked, don't you know it. 
 It wasn't until I put it down I realized I had some thoughts and objections to it. First of all, it's ridiculously similar to the Harry Potter books in both story and over all vibe. Secondly, it felt like I was reading the last book of a series and missing the first, I guess in this case, 7 books, since it's placed during our hero Simon Snow's last year of school. His past adventures are constantly mentioned and I can't help but to feel like I missed out on them and the shared history with friends and foes. So that was a bit sad. 
 But, and it's a big but, it's done with a self irony and a glint in the eye from Rowell's side. She is very much aware of the similarities to HP and other ""chosen one"" stories and she writes this book knowing that and That makes all the difference. I can easily forgive her where I probably wouldn't forgive any other author. 
 For me this book was mainly about love. The fantasy part wasn't especially new or word building, even though the magic was actually quite interesting and quirky. Here magic worked with the power of words and by using modern phrases, nursery rhymes and pop culture references, you could do a whole lot of damage by putting them together in different combinations. She also had that Diana Wynne Jones unexplained air of things, you just had to accept what was said without necessarily knowing everything. 
 But yes, what Rowell does best is relationships, whether it's family, friendships or romance, and the love between Simon and Baz is 100 % believable. It's just adorable and amazing, like always when Rowell is writing. She is so good at at making human and believable characters, even when one happens to be most certainly dead, as he is a vampire. 
 Its easy to be harsh on a book once you've read it, and I'm trying not be, because I stayed up 2 nights binge reading this and didn't have time for food or people or anything. That's how exciting and good it was. If that's not a good grade then I don't know what is."
4,"Can I just give an insanely huge thank you to this author for NOT being afraid of her ending? There is very little worse than reading an intensely emotional, painful book and having it end with every single character finding their happy place. 
 This is NOT that book. This is not a book of sunshine and rainbows but it IS a powerful book with an important message that I think people, especially teenagers, NEED to hear. 
 Your actions and choices DO matter. They DO make a difference. And staying silent about something important? That IS a choice and it WILL have an impact and you ARE to blame for the result and you DO have to accept the consequences. 
 GOOD on ya Ms. Grace. You have now become one of my favorite people."

 ---------------------------------- 
 I loved Just One Day and I feel like I've been waiting a million years to read Just One Year. But, of course, when I finally got the book from the library I put it off and put it off in true Lisa fashion. And now I feel like that was a mistake. 
 Because, oh my god, you guys! Just One Year was so good. I will go ahead and say that I did kind of like the first book more, but I still absolutely adored this one. Willem, while not by any means ""perfect"", captured my heart. In fact, he is kind of a train wreck, Willem... but I think that's why I like him. He seems real. 
 This entire book is one big ""OH MY GOD""! I feel like I got jerked around in so many different ways. Several times I went back to the first book for comparison and just wanted to scream. Just One Year is by no means a ""thriller"" or ""suspense"" novel, but I feel like I was being wound up in suspense the whole time. Life, I tell you guys. Life. 
 Poor Willem went through so much in this book. In regards to Allyson, yes, but also when it came to other aspects of his life as well. Though he made a good show of it, his life was really way less awesome than it seemed at first, and that is touched on (and in some respects, concluded) in this installment. Like in JOD, Willem too goes through a growing process, making this book all the more fantastic. I adored that it wasn't just about Willem and Allyson's relationship. 
 Did I like Just One Year? Well, I think I kind of loved it. I can't wait to buy my own copy and push it on everyone I know. Gayle Forman has such a wonderful and impacting way of writing. I can't wait to see what else she pulls out of her mind."
4,loved it and i don't really know how to explain why. 4.5 stars
5,"Oh I loved this book so much!!!!!!! 
 Review: Kaylee Cavanaugh is discovering some unique new powers. And not any normal powers either, she screams when someone is about to die. A terrible blood curling scream. Not only is she not sure what she is she thinks she is going crazy. Kaylee starts to seek answers to what may be happening to her, she finds startling answers and something wonderful she never expected. 
 I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!! SO MUCH! seriously! I had bought this maybe like a month ago and then I came across a raving review that made me pick this up. By the way I looked for the review but I couldn't find it! I was so mad! Instead of doing my homework I read this book and loved it! 
 Kaylee was just a great character. I loved reading about her and her abilities.Getting in her head and knowing what she was thinking was amazing! Everything was just so unique and new to me and it made me read the book more because I needed to know what Kaylee was and what she could do. Nash was another plus factor in this book. He was incredibly hot and very sweet. But when reading summaries for the other books.....it sounds like he is being a bad boy. I have the other ones on order so hopefully they get here today or tomorrow. 
 The romance was very good and well written and I really, really enjoyed it. I mean who doesn't love romance!? 
 Anyway, all the character were great and so was the plot. I really like the suspense and the murder. I mean I didn't like it but I liked reading about it, if that makes any sense! I never saw that ending coming! I was like WOW!! 
 Overall this is one of my new favorite books and I finished it in about a day! Read this because you won't regret it!!

1,"Boring, juvenile, ridiculous. 
 The plot drags, the writing is awful, and when things do happen they're so ridiculous that I couldn't stop rolling my eyes. 
 Dorothy Must Die wasn't this bad. I didn't think it was amazing, but I liked it well enough. The Wicked Will Rise is just awful. Amy is a terrible heroine in this book. She's as unlikable as they get, and uninteresting to boot. She's a terrible narrator. The author tries to write her as being sarcastic and funny, but she fails miserably. 
 All of the characters speak like morons. They call each other 'toots' and 'babe.' 
 The action scenes are stilted and just odd. This author does not write first person action well at all. I wish I had the words to describe it, but all I can say is that reading action scenes from Amy's point of view was bizarre and not at all appealing. I didn't feel like I was there. I felt like I was reading reallllllly bad teenage fanfiction. And as a fan of fanfic, that's saying something. 
 What a waste of time. I'm glad I got it from the library and didn't pay for it."
4,"pooled ink Reviews: 
 If the book's blurb doesn't immediately take you captive then you must be a tinge mad because it contains everything required of a desperately good read. 
 This slanted world of good and evil trods along at a brisk English pace. The story moves along at its own dignified speed, beginning with a frantic wake from sleep and a long-time tradition of midnight interrogations amongst the boys. Confess your sins or the smoke will do it for you. Either way you will be punished for your sinful spirit, as are the rules of the school. 
 I found Vyleta's writing to be seamless to fall into and roll along with its current. He definitely has a strong talent for storytelling, at least via writing. One can immediately tell that this story is not American and not of this time for the style is quite different, more somber, frank, evenly paced, and flowing. It's perfect for the telling of this bleak mysterious account of Thomas, Charlie, and Julius as they rebel, stumble, and pry their way into startling truths about their lives. 
 Vyleta writes a thrilling fantasy that seeps into your skin holding you caught in its addictive grasp as it transports you back a century into the English countryside at a boys school, a pompous hierarchy amidst a world where sin and wickedness reveals itself in the form of smoke and soot. One cannot hide their evil thoughts or dark deeds because it pours out for all to witness. Intriguing, chilling, mysterious, and quite English, Smoke rapidly ensnares the reader and draws them into its withered world. This story could easily fit into the themes of Midsomer Murders, Charles Dickens' tales, Agatha Christie's works, or the like but with its own twist of unsettling fantasy.

5,"What a surprise. I happened across this book on accident when trying to look for something else entirely on Amazon. What a fun surprise this was. 
 I'm not sure if the fact that I have had a SLEW of terrible awful no good very bad book luck lately made this book just that much better to find, or if, it was in fact, just as amazing as I thought. Doesn't matter, either way, this book was awesome. I laughed at parts in the beginning, middle, and end. Just when things were getting too heavy in the story, BOOM the author threw in some light humor with perfect timing. Maybe because of the ominous grey tone of the cover, I thought this would be a more angsty darker read (there was angst, but it wasn't terrible). 
 Gemma was hilarious chaos. She was a mess. And I can relate to that one hundred percent. A lot of her thought processes made perfect sense to me in the fact that in her position I would have done/imagined the same things. So the fact that she was a nut case who was incredibly relatable was pretty awesome. Her friends were amazing, and as far as friends go, perfect for her. Her mom needed a bitch slap, and her 'dad' (even if he did 'try', he is a billionaire, he OBVIOUSLY didn't try hard enough) needed a kick in the ass. 
 Chase, poor Chase. His family was one totally f*cked up mess. Makes a person wanna run far far away from those crazies. Especially the messed up 'uncle'... however with such a screwed up situation, he still turned out alright. A little broody, and little cavemanish, and totally bossy, but I enjoyed it. Not sure how he didn't just stab his cousin and pay to have the body removed, but that's just me. Haha. 
 I would recommend this read to anyone who enjoys a good well rounded romance, with shots of humor throughout. Okay, so I basically recommend this one to... everyone."
3,"I'm afraid that John Scalzi is firmly entrenching himself in the three star category. Interesting ideas. Writing and characters which are rather one-dimensional, but which I enjoy nonetheless. But his books always seem to be less than what they could be. Great ideas that never quite pan out to their full potential. Writing that's passable but hasn't been polished. Worst of all, he seems to take pride in this fact -- he often talks about how he banged out a book in a few short months, as if speed is a virtue greater than the actual output. I'm afraid that Scalzi is, in my mind, becoming an author I can count on for an entertaining read, but one who continually disappoints me that he doesn't try that little bit more."
4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 Disclaimer: I picked this up because I liked the author's blog. 
 The one thing I really hate about Goodreads is the fact that I can't give half stars. Sometimes something is more than ""liked it"" but not quite ""really liked it"". This is a 3.5 or higher, but not quite a four. Here's why it's not quite a four - the characterization could have been a little better for there are places in the novel where it is a little uneven and there are, quite frankly, a bit too many info-dumps. I may or may not touch on these issues further in this review. 
 There is far, far, far, far too much urban fantasy out there where a girl with a chip on her shoulder has two men pursuing her. These men are usually supernatural's and one is the ""bad boy"" while the other is a ""good boy"". 
 Thankfully, Ms. Armintrout keeps the meaning of bad. 
 Cause too often in UF the bad boy's (and sometimes he's the true love) behavior is stalker like. 
 Carrie, the heroine of this book, is in fact a woman and not girl. She is in her later twenties and after a rather bad night becomes a vampire. On top of that, she finds herself caught between two men who represent two sides. The first, the bad boy, is her sire Cyrus who is a real vampire. He does not sparkle; he's like a shark on steroids that is addicted to S&M, and believes vampires should rule the world. The second man, the good boy, is Nathan who is a vampire who is also a vampire hunter. There is just one little problem. Nathan and his quasi son Ziggy are not members of Buffy's team. 
 Think Van Helsing times six hundred. Chose us or die. 
 The decisions Carrie has to make are far more than ""Team Cyrus"" or ""Team Nathan"". The choice is about who she should be as a person- or a vampire - a far more important question than who she should sleep with. 
 BTW - if you are Team Cyrus, seek help. 
 And that's point. Carrie's choice is compound by the fact that as her sire, her maker, Cyrus has a bond with her. In fact, Carrie's relationship with Cyrus is one of the few where a writer really takes a look at the idea of control. It's true that in some cases the excuse of the blood tie is used a bit too much, but it is also immensely refreshing to read a book where the ""love"" scene with the bad boy are not the be all and end all. There is a load of difference between the interactions between Carrie and Cyrus, and Carrie and Nathan. The scenes where Carrie is with Cyrus are uncomfortable, and seem intended to be that way. And this is because of the question of control and free will. It's nice to see someone really, truly look at that issue. To take the step and deal with issues like abusive relationships and how some UF stories use them, whether Stockholm syndrome would take place. Is it done perfectly? No, not quite. The characterization could be a little more even or fluid. But Armintrout does really seem to be examining sexual politics in a way that very few others in the paranormal/UF books. The only other writer I can think of it who has touched upon the issue in such a way is Carrie Vaughn. 
 And that's why I rounded up. That and the fact that the vampires are not toothless Romeos, and Armintrout does write in such a way that we can see why Carrie is tempted, why she might give into the dark side. And at the end, you really can't help wanting to shout, 'You go girl!'. The book isn't perfect but it is enjoyable and different enough to stand out."
5,"I loved every piece of this book. And I'm definitely digging the whole Seven Sins theme going on. 
 I was looking for an easy read and this book more than delivered. It did have an issue and quite entertaining moments don't get me wrong; but everything was normal and the angst level was just right for a lovely book. The spark between Jax and Rowan was amazing. I loved how he developed these strong bonds both with her and Lily and how they ended up forming the best kind of family, one where the love for each other was given and formed out of being selfless and caring. 
 I will definitely be waiting for the other six stories, because each of the guys sounds interesting and I am guessing their stories will be equally outstanding like Jax's. Hopefully the books will come fast between each other because I can hardly wait."
4,"Is this a great year for Potterheads or what? 
 First Cursed Child, then Fantastic Beasts and now this! I don't care if it's good or bad or a mixed bag. We're getting something to talk about and discuss and that is more than enough for me. Power, Politics and Pesky Poltergeists is the second of three in the Short Stories from Hogwarts series. It is 75 pages long and filled with trademark J.K Rowling goodness. I don't know what Pottermore has got to do with it. Maybe these stories have already been published on Pottermore before? In any case, I hadn't read them and so the experience was a joyful one. 
 Chapter 1: Dolores Umbridge 
 In it, we are given details about her childhood, her ascent to power, her eventual downfall along with the sources of inspiration for her character and the author's thoughts about it. This bit is what I most enjoyed reading. 
 Chapter 2: Ministers for Magic, Azkaban 
 My most favorite of all chapters, it gives the history of the prestigious ""Head of the Wizarding World"" position; brief descriptions of all Ministers of Magic, from Ulick Gamp to Kingsley Shacklebolt. I don't understand why Hermione wasn't in this. 
 Getting to know how Azkaban became the notorious prison we know of was really exciting! It is also revealed that Kingsley purged the prison of all the Dementors instead posting Aurors who guarded it in shifts. 
 Chapter 3: Horace Slughorn 
 There wasn't much in it that we hadn't known or read between the lines before. Strangely, this was really long and really very boring. It had nothing new except perhaps for his birthday and his wand information. 
 This chapter also contained an essay on Potions, Polyjuice Potion and Cauldrons and the most interesting thing to read in those essays were J.K Rowling's thoughts. It was fun getting to know what inspired her to add these things to her world. 
 Chapter 4: Quirrinus Quirrel 
 Again, nothing particularly fascinating or new. 
 Chapter 5: A Pesky Poltergeist 
 I liked this one. A short history of Peeves and his stay at Hogwarts. 
 All in all, a memorable read."
3,"I totally typed ""Skin Job"" into the search bar at first, and then realized how dirty it sounded. Anyway, picking this book up back when it was first published caused me to realize I had no idea what the fuck was going on in this series, prompting me to go back and re-read all the previous books. 
 ...Yeah. 
 So, with that accomplished, I was finally able to read this, the newest book in the series. 
 And it was ok. Which is weird, cos it's a heist book, and I love heists. But I dunno. 
 I'm more-so excited for the next one, to see the development of threads laid in this book. 
 The good: 
 -Harry muttering 'parkour' after fucking up his leap and face planting 
 -the fact that he's using the crystal prisons as hurdles 
 -Mister sprawled out in Harry's lap, totally blissed out, glad his human is back 
 -the speech Harry makes to the Famor [or w/e] that's basically like 'tell your boss if I see him in my city again, I'll punch his teeth out.... Assuming he has teeth' 
 -Octokongs 
 -Mouse being Maggie's support dog 
 -Harry and Bob pretending to fight, while actually co-ordinating attacks against their enemies 
 -the entire scene between Harry FINALLY acting as Maggie's dad and tucking her in and fussing over Mouse and oh god so many feelings 
 -I especially love the moment of Harry realizing that Maggie is another person, an actual human being, not just this cherished ideal 
 -Uriel getting in on the fight FINALLY 
 -Harry being reassured that Michael still thinks he's a good man and drawing strength from that 
 -Harry yelling PARKOUR as he makes the final jump of the smashy ice maze 
 -I adore Hades in the Dresden verse. I love that Persephone has agency (that is, chose Hades), and that Hades named his dog 'Spot' 
 -Hades wanting to shake Harry's hand and wish him luck 
 -""Pansy?"" 
 ""Oh, sorry, I thought you were quoting the movie."" 
 ""What movie?"" 
 ""Holy Grail?"" 
 ""Nicodemus still has it."" 
 -The spot on description of Mouse's ""happy little sounds"" because he's so relieved Harry is ok 
 -Harry giving Mouse permission to join the kids in their game of running around the house like maniacs 
 -Butters as a jewish knight of the cross 
 -Grey is awesome; cool to see a moral skin walker 
 -I'm glad Anna survived and is ok 
 -Michael believing that Harry will be able to resist Mab's influence and that of the Winter Knight mantle 
 The awkward: 
 -that vivid sex dream Harry has about Murphy 
 -""Beautiful Susan, who I failed"" way to rob her of agency Harry 
 -Molly not telling her parents she's the Winter Lady 
 -Michael thinking that Molly and Harry are a thing 
 -FUCKING BUTTERS RUINING EVERYTHING 
 -What did Murphy do to break the sword?? idgi 
 -Poor Ascher :( 
 -It's so gross that her motivations for practicing the craft aren't ""pure"" enough and it's shitty for Harry to judge her to that 
 -not to mention she's on the run for using her powers to kill 3 men who were trying to rape her like c'mon 
 -I totally called the back up skull thing 
 Lore stuff to remember for next time: 
 -Molly can use tech, meaning she's super not human anymore 
 -the coins were able to escape the church's grasp meaning there's a leak 
 -Murphy has admitted she loves Harry 
 -the tired Brit under Demonsreach is a loose end"
5,"4.5, I love this series. But the way this book ended made me angry. Now I have to wait for the next book. I can't wait damn it!!!!!"

 I cant wait to read the next book in the series...."
4,"Ah, Dan! Dan, Dan, Dan! 
 Dan hooked me with his trilogy about a young sociopath hunting serial killers (I AM NOT A SERIAL KILLER). His writing is fantastic, as is his characterization. 
 And now he's done something completely different: writing a story set in a grim future where 99.9 percent of the population has been killed by a terrible virus, no babies born live more than three days, and there is constant threat of attack from superhuman soldiers. And it's from the point of view of teenage girl, no less. 
 Guess what? He pulls it off! The characters are believable, the story is gripping, and Dan's vision of a decaying future is both realistic and terrifying. This is such a great book, and I can't wait for the sequel."
3,"I had a hard time with this book because I spent the entire time thinking, ""ok they're about to get caught""! Other than that, I enjoyed the story very much & liked the love story too. Sebastian was great but I think he'll be amazing at 27! The writing was great and sex was hot but like I said I just couldn't get past the secrecy of it all!"
4,Excellent story. Review to come.
3,"Nowadays, I always feel so immature whenever I read anything with angst. Maybe around 2-3 years ago it would've appealed to me. Now I kind of cringe inside every time he does something so immature, contrary to his relative maturity to everyone else. I guess it's a case of alienation, but I think I don't know which side is right. 
 Though I value all the voices in this book. I like his insights too. No need to go further XD"
5,"from kalireads.com: 
 This was a novel of beautifully slow pacing. A husband and wife out to a painfully slow, grotesquely upscale dinner which they admit dreading from the morning of. The drinks, the appetizers, the meal, the desserts, and all the life in between. The novel matched the meal in time - dragging in a way that was purposeful and neat. The lines that finished each chapter were crisp and the chapters themselves were timed beautifully, each chapter ending with a cut that left an absence, a statement in itself with the words unsaid. 
 I listened to the audio version of this book, narrated by Clive Mantel, and he took the time with the story that it deserved. Each time he spat out the family name I felt all the emotions boiled up underneath ""Lohman"", I heard the contempt broiling up in way that is hard to do in a narration without sounding overdone. 
 I was surprised to read other reviews that compared this to Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn. Every book I've read since Gone Girl has been published, there's a required comparison. I don't see too many similarities. I would compare this to the film There Will Be Blood by Paul Thomas Anderson, for its slow crawl through the story, and its emphasis on family, social expectations, and violence. Or another comparison here, without giving too much away of either book, would be to Defending Jacob by William Landay. 
 I loved this book and it helped me get through several loads of laundry and many commutes. If you dislike a book that drifts before it reaches its conclusion, however, I'd skip it."
5,"Artemis, dear Artemis, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways. This series is so much fun, and I love the characters."
4,"Okay, this will be a hard review for me. I think I'll sound a little like I have a split personality:) 
 Gin Blanco, aka the Spider, is continuing with her mission to exact revenge upon Mab Monroe for killing her older sister and mother 17 years earlier. She's slowly chipping away at Mab's empire and (for the first time ever) leaving her mark so that everyone knows it was her. Now, Mab has someone else working for her, a hired assassin out to get the Spider and Bria (Gin's long lost sister and the person Mab believes will be her ultimate downfall). Gin has to work through a lot of her own personal emotions with regard to Owen and how he may fit into her life. Gin also has discovered the great rewards of working pro bono. I can't say much more or I will give away the surprises. 
 What I liked? The general flow of the story - it progresses at a manageable speed, not too much action all the time and not too much slow time either. Gin grows more in this story, I think, than she has yet so far in the series. We learn a little more about Bria, too. I found the suspense wonderful, the fight scenes were detailed enough to cause tension and stress (all good), while not being overly done so that I feel like I have battle fatigue. I also liked the ending - no real cliff hanger - thank you Jennifer Estep! I also enjoy Estep's writing style. 
 What I didn't really like? I really can't stand the way the author constantly reminds me of what happened in previous books (and sometimes previous chapters of this book). Maybe she's trying to work it so that it could be read without reading the previous books and not leave the reader scratching his/her head. But enough! I feel like I could have halved the book if I deleted all of the repetitive scenes. Honestly, I must have simply skipped over 3 or 4 paragraphs at a time on more than 10 occasions simply because the author was reminding us of earlier things. That was really the only big thing that I had a problem with in this book, but (for me) it was a REALLY big thing. Jennifer, if you are reading this review - PLEASE reconsider adding so much in the way of review and reminders for the reader? Thanks:) Oh, there is one more thing that kind of irritates me about this book (and the previous ones as well) and that's the so called relationship that Gin and Detective Caine had together. I just don't see it as a relationship. It seemed more like an infatuation Gin had with Caine and he had a curious interest in her, but a true relationship? No. I also don't get how she's so hurt over his leaving because he couldn't deal with her chosen profession. I get that part, but why would she be sooooo hurt by it? They didn't really have a true relationship. They never had a date, or much of a true conversation - it seemed mostly like sex and maybe an appreciation of Caine's principles. 
 I can't wait to read the next book in this series and I will definitely recommend this book to others."
5,"This one was fantastic, because it had such interesting characters. I enjoyed seeing someone from the Lore coming from an entirely different background and perspective, as well as the addition of a child into the storyline. 
 When I stared this series, I remembered thinking that after I read a few, they would probably all seem the same. That is not the case. The more books she writes, the more fascinating the world becomes, and the deeper she digs with the character development.

4,If you read this backwards it totally makes sense!
3,"Marko and Alana find a place to settle down, with Alana working as an actor for the underground Open Circuit. Meanwhile, Marko takes Hazel for dance lessons; Prince Robot IV's wife has a son, (view spoiler)[ his wife gets killed and their son is kidnapped (hide spoiler)]. 
 There's lots more of these, or I think there are, these are combinations of the graphic novel, but I'm not sure I'll read them, even if I can get them from the library. I got this from my public library."
3,"I devoured this book very quickly, with a fascination that made me unable to put it down. With a look into life in a community that is a cult, a commune where every man has many wives, what happens to a young girl coming of age. Her story rings true - a little too true at times - and is disturbing. I didn't want it to be real but suspect it is somewhere. 
 The ending was a little too quick though, a little too pat, and the deaths a little too senseless. I felt rushed and that everyone on the outside were too ready to take action (would they be? seriously with the red tape, the bureaucracy...I can't even imagine the police finding her so fast...) And it left too many questions. A hint of hope is all you get after such a disturbing book that I came away unsettled and a little traumatized myself. 
 So...an interesting read. Just not a pretty one."
4,"If you're looking for a quick, creepy read, look no further than The Winter People. Told from various viewpoints at various points in time, the action never stops. 
 Sara Harrison Shea is a local legend in West End because of her daughter's premature death and her own brutal end. Some of her diary entries exist and claim to hold the secret to reanimating the dead, and that she performed this feat with her own daughter Gertie. One hundred years later, a family living in Sara's home stumbles upon her secrets and hope they can use her knowledge to find their missing mother."
4,"Sunshine is about to be a Food Network star. Think Rachel Ray or Giada. The only problem is she can't really cook, her recipes aren't hers, she lied about every detail of her life, and she may have gotten a little too close to her married producer. On the night of her 35th birthday all of her secrets are revealed on Twitter. Overnight she loses her job, home, and husband. And so the story starts as she gets thrown from her pinnacle of glory to the bottom of heap where she has to decide who is the real Sunshine and what is truly important in life. 
 I love the Food Network celebrities so I really enjoyed the setting of this novel. You also can't help but root for Sunshine who owns her mistakes and is capable of self reflection. At the heart of the story is the mystery of who outed Sunshine to the world and I can say that I did not see that one coming. The story is also relevant to today's social media where anyone can craft a persona online even it it is at odds with who they really are. I enjoyed the story but if I had one small criticism it would be that the ending felt a little abrupt. Things are left ambiguous as to Sunshine's eventual fate. I would have liked a more tidy wrap up after becoming invested in the characters."
4,"Toni Murphy had a strained relationship with her parents and younger sister, Nicole, and had more than a few enemies at school. Her high school boyfriend, Ryan, was just about the only person in the world she could count on. Tragedy strikes the Murphy family when Nicole is murdered and Toni and Ryan are convicted of the crime. Now at the age of 34, Toni has just been released from prison and she has a choice to make; try to move on with her life or search for the answers of what really happened the night her sister was killed. 
 This is one of those books where you have a pretty good idea which direction it is heading, but it is still fun watching the whole thing play out. What was interesting to me was just about every character in the book was unlikable. I can't remember the last time I read a mystery where I couldn't muster up at least some sympathy for the victim or victim's family. Regardless of how I felt about the characters, the book still held my interest and I am looking forward to checking out the author's other books."
4,"This book is a dark BDSM erotica. And it was surprisingly good. I've just started with Ms. Thomas and so far i like her work. 
 The story is about a young woman who wakes up to anybody's worst nightmare. In a room with no windows and at the mercy of a complete stranger. 
 What is a very important element of this book is that her captor doesn't speak to her. At all!! It added so much difficulty to Emily's position. It had me glued to the pages. 
 The ending I DID NOT LIKE!!!! At all.. 
 SPOILER BELOW!!! 
 I would have wanted some other sort of reconciliation, if there had to be any reconciliation at all. She could have gone ahead with her life or just plain go back and kick the hell out of the bastard. But the reason i gave a high mark to this book was that Ms. Thomas delivered in one way a true meaning of master and slave relationship. Not my cup of tea but very well done."
4,"""There's a small monster in my brain that controls my doubt. 
 The doubt itself is a stupid thing, without sense or feeling, blind and straining at the end of a long chain. The monster, though, is smart. It's always watching, and when I am completely sure of myself, it unchains the doubt, and lets it run wild."" 
 This was such a great contemporary. I loved the love for stories, in all their forms, and seeing Eliza's passion come to life in her comics. I loved Wallace and seeing him grow close with Eliza. And I loved seeing each of them beginning to grow and heal in their own ways. Eliza Mirk is a secret comic savant who has kept her identity as the creator of the uber popular Monsterous Sea comic a secret. But when new student Wallace happens to be one of the biggest fanfiction writers for her comic series, she starts to wonder if she should start living in the offline world. 
 Things I Liked 
 I loved the stories-within-a-story we get! The world of Orcus and the Nocturnian people that Eliza has created was so captivating. I can easily see why she has such a strong following. I also thought the Children of Hypnos story sounded super interesting. It immediately hooked me because I'm trash for all things Greek mythology, but I loved the idea of fighting your nightmares. 
 I loved seeing the included pieces of artwork from the comics. They were beautiful and I liked seeing Eliza's characters coming to life. 
 All of Wallace and Eliza's flirting and getting-to-know-you stage was so endearing and cute. They had so many adorable moments that made me all swoony and smiley. Honestly, I liked Wallace and Eliza most when they were together. 
 Things I Didn't Like 
 I didn't really connect with Eliza. I actually thought she was pretty unlikeable for large portions of the book. We just didn't click. 
 It felt like her brother's were aged up at the end of the story, just to be able to defend her against her parents. It felt weird. 
 Eliza and Her Monsters was such a fun contemporary that had all the elements I want. Even with my minor complaints, I still loved so many things about the story and the journey we see the characters go on.This is one of those books that made me want to read more and puts you in a great mood."

4,"This was a reread for me. It's still a delightful, whimsical tale. The narrator of the audiobook has a lovely voice too, it really enhanced the story."
2,"It's so weird to be giving a book 2 stars and yet knowing that you might one day, mayberead the next one. 
 This book tried way too hard to be some sort of tribute to BTVS and I don't know what else (X-men?), and didn't quite manage to pull it off. 
 There was no depth to the characters, they were so unremarkable that I sometimes had trouble knowing who was saying what if it wasn't explicitly pointed out to me because everyone's voices were so similar. Not even to the overachiever Main Character, Harper, who was supposed to entertain me with her funny commentary, wits, and badassery managed to stand out. 
 The humor wasn't great. I might have laughed a couple of times and not because of the many 'trying-way-too-hard' jokes inserted in the dialogue. (That bit about the lipstick at the beginning of the book? I almost dnf'd right there) 
 The ""romance"" was tropey to the max, which on its own is not bad, but the author abused the rivals-to-lovers trope (Not a spoiler because this is right there in the book's blurb) and it felt forced when MC Harper already had a perfectly nice boyfriend who couldn't be more sweet. 
 The bad guys who wanted to kill/turn/help the other MC (David) were ??? (This actually made no sense. They first wanted to kill David because of ""X"" and then all of a sudden, with little to no explanation they want to help David because of the same reason they wanted to kill him in the first place? What's up with that? 
 I don't know, this book was sort of a very predictable, over-simplistic and not that funny read with a plot that could give so much more than what it was. 
 BUT it was sort of entertaining and a super fast read and, again, I miiiiiiight read the second book...one day."
1,"** spoiler alert ** 
 Where to begin? 
 I've been devouring a lot of YA fiction lately, especially that of the supernatural kind and, honestly, I'm running out of avenues. I'd been putting off the Blue Bloods novels because they just didn't interest me. Well, today I was bored so I picked this little gem up from the library. It passed a few hours' worth of my time. Was it worth it? Well, I got some laughs. 
 The book opens with a massive cliche. Which I suppose should have warned me and put me off reading the rest of it, but I like to finish what I begin and, like I said, I was bored. Our main protagonist is Schuyler Van Alan. Tiny, black hair, blue eyes, absolutely gorgeous but, of course, completely unaware of it. She dresses like a bag lady. Well, more like a very lucky bag lady who ransacks the trash bins of wealthy socialites and has revolving credit at fancy consignment shops. 
 She has only one friend (of course), a boy named Oliver who is (of course) in love with her, while she is (of course) completely unaware of how he feels about her. Next cliche. 
 Everyone else at her prestigious private school ignores her. Of course. 
 UNTIL... 
 Until one night when she's out with Oliver and she sees the ever-popular and completely gorgeous Jack Force. He flirts with her and she's completely confused by his sudden attention to her. 
 So you would think this eventually goes somewhere. Not really. Jack and Schuyler DO share a couple of scenes together, but nothing all that great. They kiss once, but even that has a very strange vibe, like it just shouldn't be happening. Probably because there isn't a whole lot of build up. They don't manage to kiss for long, either, because they're interrupted by Jack's twin sister, Mimi. 
 The Jack and Mimi storyline is where things started to get creepy and make less and less sense. 
 Jack's and Mimi's ""relationship"" is very quickly revealed to be more than what the average brother and sister share. Creep factor through the roof at this point. I mean, I guessed right away that it was some kind of reincarnation thing, but EWW. Come on. 
 And Mimi's a total bitch, but not even in a believable way. I got the feeling I was supposed to really hate her, but I couldn't. There just wasn't enough there. 
 Schuyler has no parents. Her dad is dead, her mom's been in a coma since she was a baby, and she's been neglectfully supervised by her ""grandmother"" Cordelia. Cordelia is a throw-away character. She exists within the book merely for the sole purpose of providing a quick source of information for Schuyler, then she's killed off. Let's just call her Tissue from now on. Schuyler blew her nose on her and her literary mission was accomplished. 
 So I trudged through the first half or so of this book wondering why in the hell I was still reading since all I kept hearing about was how rich these people are and the kinds of clothes they wear, the hotels they stay in, the food they eat, etc. But then I got to the good stuff. 
 Wait for it.... 
 The ""Blue Bloods"" are nothing more than a group of 400 fallen angels whose punishment for betraying God was being condemned to live their immortal lives on earth until they've reached a zen-like state of contrition. At least, that's their mission; to be allowed back into the ""garden"" after paying penance for their misbehavior. So they don't kill humans. Not at all, in fact, they try to help us! Did you know that all the beautiful and the humanitarian things in New York City are all thanks to rich angel space vampires? 
 Anyway, they're reincarnated and, at the age of 15, start undergoing their ""transformation"" to vampire. Okay. 
 So yeah, Jack and Mimi? They're ""blood bound"". Apparently this is some freaky BS wherein two souls are born as twins, but then, through a transition, one twin would assume the role of spouse. This was to preserve the family's fortune. A whole new twist on ""keepin' it in the family"". Anyone else feel like vomiting? 
 Intellectually, reading this book is akin to flipping through a toddler's board book. Not a whole lot going on. De La Cruz attempted to weave in some historical references by tying the whole Roanoke settlement mystery into the angel vampires' story, but she apparently expects that none of her readers have ever heard of it before. None of the teen characters in the book have. We're supposed to believe that these kids are attending this super exclusive private school and NONE of them have ever heard of Roanoke or Croatoan? Sure, she tries to tie that up nicely by claiming The Committee (head honcho angel vampires) have altered the memories of their own so they don't remember Roanoke, but these kids do not exist in a vacuum; they would have heard the story eventually and remembered it, ESPECIALLY since they're HUNDREDS OF YEARS OLD AND GET THE SAME MEMORIES BACK WITH EVERY INCARNATION. 
 *Sigh* 
 Anyway, Schuyler is a vampire, but she isn't part of the in-crowd because she's half human. She's the product of her mother (an angel vampire) mating with a human. She's a ""new soul"", not a reincarnated one, and she's super rare. Okay. Also, her mother, Allegra, is the archangel Gabriel (simple explanation, but just don't ask). Gabriel/Gabrielle/Allegra is supposedly the strongest of the angel vampires, but she's in a coma because she swore off of human familiars (blood bags) after her husband (Schuyler's father) died. Gabriel and the archangel Michael (who turns out to be Charles Force, Jack and Mimi's ""dad) were not condemned to the life of the angel vampires because of misbehavior, they chose to go with them to help lead them. So they were both ""pure-of-heart"". 
 Well, we find out from the human Tissue that Schuyler is amazingly powerful because of who her mother is, and then Schuyler is told (again, by the Tissue) that, according to angel vampire prophecies, the daughter of Gabrielle will ""lead them to the salvation they seek"". 
 Okay, so that means that Allegra, Ms. Pure-of-heart leader, super angel vampire woman.....has CHOSEN to stop feeding and slipped into a coma, leaving behind a super powerful, probably very important child who will need guidance....? Right? 
 Yes, let me try and untangle this; Schuyler is important. She's not a reincarnated angel, true....BUT she's the BIOLOGICAL CHILD of an archangel, powerful and IMPORTANT. Annnd...she's been abandoned by her mom and scorned by her angel vampire peers. 
 These angel vampires have about as much sense as a moldy sack of rusty hammers. But what else would you expect from New York City's elite? 
 The characters are two-dimensional and boring. The plot? On the surface it's just plain silly, but when you dig deeper it's inconsistent and completely nonsensical and looks a lot like swiss cheese with all the holes riddled throughout. This book really is the literary equivalent of a socialite; boring, vapid, shallow, narcissistic, and transparent. I can put up with a lot from supernatural YA because I don't ask much. This book, however, asked me to suspend WAY too much of my intellect while not even having the common courtesy of providing any real entertainment. 
 I know this review is all-over-the-place, but I really don't have the energy to try and rearrange everything so it makes more sense. Kinda like the book I'm reviewing."
4,The world's population has been ravaged by a disease that killed millions and left thousands paralyzed. Technology has advanced to create androids or robots that those who are paralyzed (called Hadens) can operate with their minds to be able to interact in the physical world. An entertaining novel of the near future. I'm Looking forward to reading more from this author.
4,"Mild spoilers in this review. 
 I received a copy of this book through Penguin's First to Read program in exchange for an honest review. 
 So, this book hits shelves tomorrow and I had really hoped I would get to it before the night before it was supposed to come out, but alas, life got in the way and I didn't get a chance to read it until now. That being said, I LOVED this book. I'm obsessed with the zodiac as it is, so when I saw that a new trilogy was coming out revolving around the zodiac, I knew I had to read it. It's the only book this year that I preordered six months before it came out, plus I got to read an ARC ahead of time, so that's exciting. 
 THE STUFF I LOVED: Rho. Oh my goodness, Rho is a little firecracker, plus she's the Guardian of the house of Cancer, which is my zodiac sign, so I have to love her, right? Added to the fact she takes no one's shit, and she is my favorite kind of heroine. 
 The sci-fi. I'm not normally a sci-fi fan, however, I've read a lot of YA/Sci-fi books this year, YA writers are getting better, I think, at creating sci-fi books that don't bog you down in the science parts but enhance the fiction. I loved how each House had different methods of doing pretty much the same thing, but each embraced the traits of their sign. I kind of wish we'd gotten to see a little bit more of the other houses, I feel like we know a lot about some and are in the dark about others, but that's what sequels are for, right? 
 THE STUFF I DIDN'T LIKE SO MUCH: The first couple of chapters were a little slow for me. I know, I know, exposition blah blah blah but I honestly like books that throw you straight into the action then catch you up later. I get bored by too much exposition. 
 Show, not tell. I felt like the middle part of the book had some places where I was being more told instead of shown what was going on. 
 All in all, this might be my favorite start of a series of 2014! Brava!"
2,DNF when it was apparent Phoenix had no chance. lol Im petty but whatever I still loved the series as a whole and I highly recommend reading it.
5,"Down To You 
 by M. Leighton 
 I will first off say that I am totally impressed. I was apprehensive while reading the summary on Goodreads, but after reading the book....I am soooo glad I did! 
 Twin brothers!!!! HOT!!!!!!! 
 Two brothers, who look identical, but have two totally different personalities. Cash is a typical bad boy, club owner, motorcycle riding hunk. Nash is totally opposite, soon to be lawyer, very smart, very educated hunk. 
 What's a girl to do? Especially when Nash is dating her roommate and cousin and Cash is too bad in her mind to want forever. 
 This story takes you through the rollercoaster ride that is Olivia's life. Who does she want to be with? Cash or Nash? And what will Olivia do when a bomb is dropped on her that includes Cash and Nash? 
 I was totally into this book. I sat for 5 hours straight and only put it down briefly to get my kids dinner and go through their backpacks! I liked how each chapter went through different characters perspectives of the story. I could feel how each of them felt. 
 I enjoyed the growing connection between Olivia/Cash and Olivia/Nash. I really enjoyed the twists and turns towards the end! It was a wild ride that I would have never expected. The author did a great job keeping my attention and having the story flow. 
 The epilogue....I learned that this story is to be continued! I need to know when the next one is out! It will be an auto-buy for me! 
 I highly recommend this book! I got it off Amazon/Kindle for like 4 bucks. Totally worth the money!!!!!!

 I'm intrigued enough to read the next one and the entire story kept me guessing and interested. 
 At the same time, I feel like I don't have enough answers, so that's why it only got 3 stars. There also wasn't enough interactions with Paige and Janice for me to feel like that were really friends with Rosie."

5,"4.5 stars. 
 I can see how some might be disappointed with this. From the blurb, and the cover, you'd expect a lot of action and a high body count. There isn't. So why did I love it? I'm a sucker for a love triangle (I know, I know, but I just can't help myself). Basically, this story follows a young assassin as she gets to grip with her place at the heart of the King's Court (as an unwilling 'prisoner'). Perhaps because I wasn't expecting the relationships to take centre stage, I loved it all the more. 
 There is action, and magic, and intrigue, and demons, and all sorts of wonderful fantasy elements, but they aren't the focus of this book. The story here is about an eighteen year old finding her place in the world (new adult). 
 Loved it. Great pacing. Marvellous natural relationships that don't feel forced or rushed. Add to that a sprinkling of magic and mystery, and it's the perfect story in my opinion. 
 (I only deducted .5 of a star because I'd have liked to have seen our 'assassin' be a little more intimidating, considering she's meant to be deadly)."
4,"I enjoyed The Return of the King more than the first two books of Lord of the Rings. There was a bit more action and I thought the characters were better written. 
 What keeps the finale from being a five-star review is that sometimes Tolkien used a lot of fluff and then it fell flat. The final battle at the black gate had a long buildup only to end quickly. Frodo's decision to not destroy the ring lasted only a page before it was resolved. Probably my least favorite part of the book was the Path of the Dead. Much was said about the Path of the Dead and the Shadow Host. But for all that was said, they didn't really do much. And what the did was not well played out. The dead are summoned and then just a page later, they are finished with their part. While the history and world Tolkien created was amazing, the expanse of it often came at the detriment of te story."
5,only requires words ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!
4,"3.5 stars. Just-- I can't-- TREVOR FTW. 
 Review to come."
3,"I received an eARC of this book via Netgalley. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of this review. 
 Where do I begin? Wintersong by S. Jae-Jones was my most anticipated debut of 2017 and unfortunately it did not live up to the hype in my head. A story inspired by a childhood favorite of mine -- Labyrinth -- I was just expecting more: more fantasy, more romance, more intrigue and suspense. Don't get me wrong though this book could really be labeled as a romance and nothing more. 
 Once there was a little girl who played her music for a little boy in the wood... 
 Liesl, or Elisabeth, is a young woman who takes a journey of discovery in this book. Somewhere between her childhood and now, she's lost herself, her passion for music, and her own joy. Instead she pours it all into her baby brother, a child prodigy. She gives of herself over and over again to her family, even her baby sister has been engaged to the boy she thought she loved and would be hers. The older, ugly sister always passed up for her beautiful sister and talented brother. Do you see the self-pity in those words?! This character is a shadow in the beginning and I loved seeing her progression throughout the story. 
 The Goblin King was once a friend, a playmate of Liesl as a child. But now he is all grown up and come to claim his bride. As love interests goes, I was unimpressed with the Goblin King. He was mysterious and stand-offish, then he would be overbearing and seductive. He was a contradiction that I'm still trying to grasp. But he did not frighten me, even when I thought he should have frightened Liesl. She was his Elisabeth (say that in a German accent and swoon a little please). 
 The book itself could really be split into two sections: the first a maze Underground while Liesl tries to save her sister, the second Liesl's marriage to the Goblin King. During the first part, I was most reminded of Labyrinth. Liesl is a girl who is trying to save her sister. She's terrified of the goblins and changelings that inhabit the Underground, but she puts that terror aside to rescue her family. The second part is a romance plain and simple. The Goblin King tries to trap Liesl into staying, he keeps her when she doesn't want to stay and she slowly withers. I think my biggest issue with this story is the fact that it is labeled young adult. There is nothing young adult about the second part of this book. It had me, a thirty year old, blushing while reading. That's just wrong on so many levels. 
 Overall the story was just okay for me. I was both impressed and disappointed in the Goblin King's world. I did like the tie in to historical fact about the time period, I liked Liesl, and the writing itself is beautiful, prose-like in its quality. However the romantic scenes were a bit much in my opinion for a young adult book. I know I wouldn't let my teen read it, not until they were at least 17, maybe not even then. So that friends was a let down. If you enjoy fairy tale retellings, historical fiction, and a bit of mystery, you may enjoy this book. It just didn't work for me."
3,Thanks to HarperCollins for the ARC!
5,"THIS REVIEW & MORE - Paws and Paperbacks 
 ""When this war is over, I will be yours, first, last, and always. And you will be mine."" 
 Historical fiction is one of my favorite genres, and after the wonderful experience I had reading The Bird and the Sword, I knew I was going to pick this up and try it. Thankfully, I was not disappointed. Amy Harmon weaves a stunning, heart-wrenching, beautiful story that will stay with me always. 
 Amy Harmon proves once again how talented of an author she is. Her writing is wonderful and engaging, drawing you into the story from the very beginning and never letting you go. Since I had just read The Bird and the Sword, I was very impressed at how well she was able to portray a completely different tone and feel for From Ash and Sand that was more suitable for the genre and the story that she wanted to tell. It's a talent that very few authors possess. 
 ""I have always been yours, Angelo."" she said, echoing the very words he'd thought while he prayed. She was his. ""But you have never been mine."" 
 The plot was exciting and captivating and I just could not stop reading. The author creates a very realistic portrayal of World War II and I felt the anger, terror, and loss along with the characters. The love story between Eva and Angelo was completely beautiful and heartbreaking. From the first couple of chapters I knew reading about them was going to hurt, but in the best way. It was impossible not to root for the two of them and hope for the happy ending they deserved. WWII books generally have a bittersweet ending, due to the nature of the war, and I was fully prepared for this to be the same way. Thankfully, I was content and happy with how the book ended things. 
 ""But in a room in an occupied city, with nothing left but love itself, Eva and Angelo held to each other, and found peace, rest, happiness, and safety. If only for a while."" 
 Amy Harmon is a fantastic storyteller and she is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. From Ash and Sand is a painfully beautiful story full of romance, action, sacrifice, and love. An outstanding book that I would highly recommend to anyone!"
4,"The Black Key was the last book in The Lone City series and picked up soon after the cliffhanger from the second book. There seemed like it had so many things to wrap up in such a short time and I was unsure of how it would play out. If some things would be left unresolved, if some things would barely get a mention, if everything would feel too rushed. Other than the ending feeling a bit overstuffed, I thought it was well-paced and managed to do a good job in addressing all the loose ends that needed to be addressed. 
 I did think the book may have benefited from the occasional glimpse into another character's POV. Violet was cut off from most of her rebellion group in her position so it would have been nice to see a chapter from Lucien's POV, or Raven's or Ash's, just to get the whole picture on what was happening outside of The Jewel. 
 This book showed Violet as she was at her core: a protective and loving sister. She was going to find Hazel and save her at any cost. She was so important to the rebellion, one of its leaders, but her sister still came first and it was something I could fully understand, as someone with siblings. There was a part of me that thought she was being reckless, since she has no real plan, but I understood her need for immediate action. It was her sister. 
 It was a fast read. The action was well-paced so I didn't want to stop reading. It was only near the end when it started to become a little too fast to keep up, requiring me to slow down my reading pace in order to hopefully catch everything. I also liked that, while it definitely felt like the end of Violet and Ash's story, there were many other characters who could have their own spin-off if this world was ever revisited."

3,"I thought long and hard about what I wanted to say in my review of this but after a full 24 hours I still don't have much. I've heard wonderful reviews about this 'series', not this book in particular, so I was always interested in finally reading it and seeing what my personal thoughts were. Truthfully, I was pretty disappointed with this book and would have given it 2 stars if the writing wasn't so engaging and continued to keep me interested. 
 Luckily, I'd say about 2/3 of the way through the book something finally starts happening. I'm not going to do my little blurb on the storyline because the Goodreads summary will suffice and I don't want to give too much more away anyways. I'll probably go back and update this after I've read more in the series since I've been advised to not give up if you were even slightly disappointed by this one."
3,"Interesting look at what might happen if countries did go to nuclear war. The book was written in Australia in the 60s, following the war when the rest of the world is slowly dying off from nuclear fall out. It posses the question, how would you live your final days if you knew they were coming?"
5,Rereading the trilogy in advance of the newest installment coming this fall. It's just as much the GOAT as I remembered and I love it with a fiery passion.
5,"Wow, this novella packs one hell of a punch. If you've been reading the series, it's absolutely crucial that you read this book. The story is told from Isaac and Lilli's points of view, and starts by filling in the missing pieces from events that took place in Bart's book, Alone on Earth. I needed the reminder of just how amazing Lilli and Isaac are together, and the strength of their unconditional love. Although this wrung just about every emotion out of me, the storyline wraps up nicely in preparation for the next book."
2,"It makes me very sad to rate a Tammara Webber book with two stars. This one just didn't work for me. I never attached to the main characters and the flashbacks during the first half made me struggle to get into the story at all. In fact, I never really did. 
 I won't let this deter me from reading Ms. Webber's next book, but this one just won't be on my favorites list. :("
5,"So I was in a bit of a reading slump with the books I've been reading and decided to pick this up on a whim to see if it would kickstart me back into the reading mood. And 
 HOLY 
 CRAP 
 it did NOT disappoint. 
 I flew threw this thing in two hours. I plopped on my bed, basking in my post-Thanksgiving food coma, cracked open this baby, and was utterly enraptured. I can't think of any other way to put it. I am so emotionally invested into this story now, and I can tell you that I will be going to pick up the rest of the books in this series TOMORROW. Taherah Mafi has created some brilliant characters, with depth and truth, and has created this thrilling dystopian world that is so original, offering a fresh new take on this specific sub-genre. And her writing- GOD is it beautiful, poetic and lyrical. You'd think it would be overkill, but it manages to add to the story and the character of Juliette. It made my emotions run high and my breath come short. The plot is so intricate, and this book is the perfect set-up for what is to come. Towards the beginning I was a bit unsure of Juliette's character- I thought that she was never going to open up, shed some of her vulnerability, and embrace the power that she held within her; however, throughout the story she truly grows and slowly emerges into this badass female who, by the end of this book, is ready to take on those who are set on putting the people that she cares about in danger. 
 So, SO psyched to read what happens next for Juliette, Adam, and Warner. I am a definite new fan of Taherah Mafi, and recommend this series to anyone and everyone!!!!"
3,"The Book Thief, by Markus Zusak 
 and 1/2 
 Synopsis: Set during World War II in Nazi Germany, Markus Zusak's groundbreaking new novel is the story of Liesel Meminger, a foster girl living outside of Munich. Liesel scratches out a meager existence for herself by stealing something she can't resist -- books. With the help of her best friend, Rudy, she learns to live on Himmel Street after her brother dies on the train ride there. She learns to read thanks to her accordion-playing foster father, Hans Hubermann, and shares her stolen books with her neighbors during bombing raids as well as with the Jewish man who took refuge in her basement. This is an unforgettable story about the ability of books to feed the soul and human spirit. 
 In A Sentence: A good read. 
 My Thoughts: This was a good story. The writing style was very nice; it's somehow both choppy and flowing at the same time. I really liked how well that worked. The plot was very good too, and the layout of the story was also nicely done. I also liked how the narrator was Death. It seemed very appropriate considering the setting was Germany during World War Two. 
 The characters were likeable, the story was likeable, the writing was likeable. So why am I only giving it 3.5 stars? Well, I just wasn't wowed by it. I've been reading quite a few World War Two novels lately, and I just finished The Kite Runner, so perhaps the reason why I wasn't wowed was because I read it after so many wonderful precedents. I'm also not a huge fan of endings that are revealed halfway through the story. For me, it takes the emotion out of the story, and I can't cry as a result, and for me to really like a book like this, I just have to burst into tears at the end. 
 Don't get me wrong though. It's a very good book and really worth a look if you're searching for a beautiful but sad story. Strongly recommended for historical fiction lovers. Fans of general fiction will love this too."
4,"A powerful short novel about change, language, identity, crossing, difference, sameness, life. 
 When you've read the last word of this one, you have absolutely no doubt that there's none left, it has ended. 
 Contains one of the most potent, lyrical discussions of code switching I've come across: 
 ""...alternating between a thing that believes itself to be perfect and a thing that believes itself to be perfect, morphing back and forth between two beasts until out of carelessness or clear intent they suddenly stop switching tongues and start speaking that other one. In its brims nostalgia for the land they left or never knew when they use the words with which they name objects; while actions are alluded to with an anglo verb conjugated latin-style, pinning on a sonorous tail from back there. 
 Using in one tongue the word for the thing in the other makes the attributes of both resound: if you say Give me fire when they say Give me a light, what is not to be learned about fire, light and the act of giving? It's not another way of saying things: these are new things. The world is happening anew, Makina realizes: promising other things, signifying other things, producing different objects. Who knows if they'll last, who knows if these names will be adopted by all, she thinks, but there they are, doing their damnedest."""
3,"So, he steals an egg, and everyone is just fine with that? Because why? Because he stole it from a bad man? Stealing is still stealing..."
4,"Alpha is a tense, suspense-filled story. Admittedly, I was bit thrown by the present tense format. I'm not a huge fan of that. I prefer past tense narrative. Otherwise, I have to say that Rucka has another success on his hands. I've been reading almost every graphic novel by his I can get my hands on, because he knows what he's doing. This is my first official prose book by him. He can write just as good without illustrations to tell the story. 
 I found myself feeling very sympathetic towards the sleeper agent. While he's not by any stretch a good man, I think that in another life, he could have been a better man. It's very hard to write a villain that is sympathetic, but Rucka did it well in this case. I really wish things had ended much differently for him, although he did make his choices (admittedly from a deck short of cards) in the end. 
 The idea of an action story set at an amusement park was well done. I have always had a distrust of, shall we say, people wearing character suits (something a bit disturbing about it, especially if they are animal characters), and now I won't look at them the same way again. I like how Rucka emphasized the frozen smiling face of the terrorists in their character suit. It's a metaphor for how a bland face can hide evil and latent menace, especially when one cannot see the eyes (the windows to the soul). The amusement park is almost a bit of a stand-in for Disneyland, but with its own mythology that plays out in a way that's decidedly creepy considering that the park is harboring blood-thirsty terrorists. 
 ""Alpha"" is more of a suspense book but it has plenty of action. I felt my stomach tense up in knots as the story progresses at a fast pace towards its climax. Jad is a likable protagonist despite having some flaws. I appreciate that while he's a skilled special forces operator who has earned his formidable reputation, he's not bulletproof or invulnerable. 
 I would recommend this book to people who enjoy a tightly written, well-plotted novel that straddles the fence between suspense and action. I'll definitely keep reading this series."
3,"Okay, what do I like about Dexter? Well, it's not the writing, although it is clever, not horrendous, and funny. What I like about Dexter is Lindsay writes the antihero story. It isn't always pretty; in fact it can be down right gruesome and it doesn't always end well, specifically for Doakes in this installment. 
 I won't give it more than three stars, however, because Lindsay does have a few plot and character gaps, Kyle and Deb, for example, where did that come from and go so quickly? 
 Still, I added this series to my beach reads and am sure I will enjoy each and every one, unhappily ever after."

4,"Another great J.L. Merrow story, I have enjoyed everything she has written so far. Paul is an academic. He has amnesia and walks with a cane after a terrible accident in Iceland that killed his lover. He doesn't remember the accident or his lover or anything about his time in Iceland. He returns there and is reacquainted with a co-worker, Mags and a riverboat captain, Viggo, who recognizes him. He meets Alex, a summer visitor who is hanging out at the University. There is confusion and suspense as Paul works through what is real and isn't real and tries to remember what happened to him. I agree with some others that the ending did seem a little simpler than I had imagined, but the story is so well told that it didn't bother me."
2,"U.S. President Lyndon Johnson once formed an alliance with a erstwhile political enemy. When someone asked him why, Johnson remarked that he would rather have the enemy inside the tent urinating out than outside the tent urinating in. 
 So it is with Shermer. His thesis, that the human brain through the process of natural selection has evolved to see patterns, even when none exists, gives him a platform from which he may assault the many, many popular beliefs with which he disagrees. It is enjoyable to see him attack 9/11 truthers and similar boneheads with an unabridged dictionary, apparently unburdened by the idea that doing so may be a futile exercise. It was less enjoyable to see him attack belief in God. I consider (rightfully or not) my life to be difficult and when I reward myself and sit down with a book at the end of a day, it is usually not with the aim of seeing cherished beliefs, which have been arrived at after much thought, get paddled with, to my mind, unseemly enthusiasm and loaded vocabulary designed to provoke, despite author's protestations to the contrary. 
 More importantly, though, I also thought he was missing another point, specifically, that while belief in God has undoubtedly led to much senseless cruelty and suffering, it has also inspired people to behave selflessly and compassionately. Compare this to, say, 9/11 truthers, whose theories, as far as I can tell, have inspired a lot of ugly name-calling, baseless suspicion, paranoia, and threats but, to the best of my knowledge, have not motivated anyone to behave with greater charity to their neighbor. Even if you believe in neither God or 9/11 conspiracy theories, it is an unfortunate rhetoric choice to lump them together as irrationally held views. 
 I imagine that Shermer might say that he is uninterested in the utility of false views, and that he is only interested in whether they are true or false. He often stops in his tracks during the book to remind us, in case we've forgotten, how dedicated to truth and other admirable things (e.g., p. 48: ""I am a radical for liberty"") he is, implying in my mind that people who disagree with him are insufficiently concerned with such things. In spite of these professions, I found that the book was concerned more with score-settling than truth-telling, and could have used a good editor to strike out every occurrence of the words ""I"", ""me"", ""my"", and ""mine"", plus surrounding anecdote, after which the author could try to write a book with more humor and self-deprecation, and less chest-thumping and self-promotion. As the book stands now, the author's voice is so off-putting that it worked to discredit his ideas. 
 I apologize to my good friend Joel, who sent me a gift certificate while recommending this book, for this cranky review, and urge him to keep sending me book recommendations."
3,"3 Stars 
 I have no words for the conclusion of the ""Love is War""-duet. Book 2 was even more f***ed up than book 1. Yes, that is possible! :P 
 Book 2 is written in Scarlett's and Dante's ""Past"" and ""Present"" POV. The ""Present"" chapters progress very slowly and nothing interesting or major happens up until 36%. Only then did the story get a little more interesting, slowly but steady. The ""Past"" chapters reveal little by little what happened to Scarlett and Dante, what made them break up and what triggered all the hatred, especially on Scarlett's side. And believe me when I say you will be shocked - at least I was! I didn't see anything of that coming - but looking back it made all sense. :D 
 This book is, like the first one, full of angst, hatred, jealousy and insecurities. It is also full of scheming and drama. The books are actually a perfect screenplay for a soap opera. I don't mean it as an insult or something; soap operas are fun and great but the books contain so many over the top situations and they usually only or often work in soap operas. haha 
 All in all the conclusion was slightly over the top but the perfect way to finish this series because let's be honest: book 1 was a little over the top, too. ;) 
 I rate this book with 3 instead of 2.5 stars because the shocking surprises toward the end left me a little speechless. 
 There is no cliffhanger but a HEA - of course. ;)"
4,Cute little graphic novel about self-realization. The art is what sold me on this more than the story.
4,"This is a review of the audio book - and boy, was it ever hilarious. The narrator brought all of the characters to life, even the orange furball named Clive had a particularly feline voice. 
 Poor Caroline has lost her O. To make matters worse, her apartment walls are very thin and she hears a lot of the action going on next door. So much so, that she nicknames her very gorgeous neighbor ""Wallbanger."" 
 This is a a very cute romance. Lots of misunderstandings, spats, and baking. I loved how Simon woo-ed Caroline. He was so romantic - what girl cold refuse a trip to a beach house in Spain? Kudos for including Clive the cat for some comedy relief. Just picturing that kitty cock blocking scene makes me laugh uncontrollably. 
 Loved the ending. It was perfect. Loved the inclusion of Clive's point of view as well. 
 Nicely done. Perfect light vacation reading."

 First Thought when Finished: After my crack reading (all in 2 months) of Rock Chicks, Mystery Men, and Chaos --I can hands down say Ride Steady by Kristen Ashley was the most emotionally gut wrenching, heart swelling, couple enduring book of the bunch! 
 I am hiding the rest of the review because to explain what I LOVED about this book some of the things MAY be considered SPOILERY 
 (view spoiler)[ 
 Just my thoughts: Hands down the thing I loved about Ride Steady over all the rest of the books by Kristen Ashley was the fact that the couple was solid. There wasn't that 10 pages before the end breakup. There was communication (yes it was rough and sometimes crude). There was growth together. There was a misunderstanding but oddly enough resolved with conversation. They were sexy. They were real. They were freaking worth rooting for! I even liked the end resolve with the ex. The only reason this wasn't a 5.00 was that a)I didn't like how long Joker held on to his identity and b)the overall storyline could have used a little more time. I mean come on---Kristen doesn't write short books so what would have been a few more pages. 
 What I stand with her series (favorite to least) 
 1: Chaos is at the top (2 of the 3 have been outstanding)--also really count Motorcycle Man as more of this series (it was the best Dream Man read) 
 2: Rock Chicks (those were fun) 
 3: Dream Man (those drove me bonkers) 
 Crack y'all Crack! These just have to be streamlined but now I wait *sigh*!

3,"Rating: 3.5* of five 
 The Publisher Says: With Felipe de Castro, the Vampire King of Louisiana (and Arkansas and Nevada), in town, it's the worst possible time for a body to show up in Eric Northman's front yard--especially the body of a woman whose blood he just drank. 
 Now, it's up to Sookie and Bill, the official Area Five investigator, to solve the murder. Sookie thinks that, at least this time, the dead girl's fate has nothing to do with her. But she is wrong. She has an enemy, one far more devious than she would ever suspect, who's out to make Sookie's world come crashing down. 
 My Review: Entry #12 in the seemingly eternal Sookie Stackhouse novel series. Why bother reviewing entry #12, you ask, with perfect justice, when after 12 books you're either on the bus or not interested in going where the bus is going. 
 Recently I reviewed book 13 in the Meg Langslow mystery series, to say auf wiedersehen to that giggle-loaded fun fest of a series. That book left me feeling that Donna Andrews was decorating the narrative with little bits and bobs from the past entries, and had in fact lost interest in doing anything new with it. 
 Charlaine Harris hasn't lost interest in Sookie, at least not visibly. Sookie and Eric and Bill and Pam and Sam...everyone's here and accounted for, and each one still has stuff to do that makes the book move forward. Likewise Sookie's fairy family. Sookie's life changes, not to say that Langslow's doesn't, but Sookie's life-changes come out of a story being told that has its arc. I didn't feel that in the other case. 
 And this isn't to say that I've loved every Sookie book. No indeed! A few have been middle books, in that they gave the whole arc a push forward but in and of themselves weren't that satisfying. But it's crucial to note that, each and every time I've read a Sookie book, I've felt Harris's authorial presence making something happen. And after 12 books, she's still in it, still working out the ideas and making them happen in prose that's got a voice, that's made an effort to please my aesthetic sense and still make me laugh. Harris is still out to seduce me. 
 It worked.

 Wow, if you were raised on european folklore (as I was) it feels like an old friend. 
 Rich, emotionally mature, a book that it's just a pleasure to hold in your hand."
5,"Bizarre, surreal, and wonderful. Everything we've come to expect from Night Vale. This was exactly what I needed as I head into finals. I didn't read it all in one go because I wanted to stretch it out and savour it. Which I did. 
 Recommend recommend recommend."
2,"Another YA greek mythology story. While this one is aimed a bit older than Percy Jackson or Pandora, the characters seem a bit childish for their age. 
 The mother is pretty unbelievable in her haste to move her senior daughter to a Greek Island where she will be the only one in school without powers and the romantic interest is a jerk through most of the book. Still I wanted to get to the end and find out if it would twist the way I expected (and it did). I'm not sure if I will read the sequel or not although the premise sounded kind of funny."
1,The characters were very annoying and I could not really get into the romance - it just didn't work for me. ('the taming' ugh). The writing style was not that great for me either. I did finish it though so there was something keeping me interested at least.

0,"I'm the black sheep, it seems. I loved CINDER and liked SCARLET very much, but this was my least favorite of the three. I enjoyed the scenes with Cinder, Kai, and Iko (Iko is such a fun personality), but found the Cress scenes hard to get through only because I find Cress to be an insufferable nitwit. Though I understood why she is the way she is, I didn't like spending so much time with her, mostly because she has so little agency and is quite bland."
3,"Though this book was skipped on the fore part I read it around half way through coz of the sweet talking. This bearing in mind I might not like the book, surprised me that I went through reading it without even the slight thought of being bored in my mind. I will complain that I really hate that Val don't tell Alex her business with Luke, I mean her being on a relationship with the guy kind of requires her to tell him that right? (or maybe it just me) but the fact that he don't like her past with the guy must tell her that having secret meetings with Luke would entail and raise questions in spite of the trust he gifted her. Glad and sad the ending was just them getting married in Bermuda and keeping it to themselves ( sneaky of them to do this, I tell ya)."

5,"Actually, the third book was my favorite. 
 One of my summer goals that will probably go unfulfilled was to reread all of the Harry Potter books before the last movie comes out. I just finished The Prisoner of Azkaban, and although I finished it in record time (I started it at 3:00 p.m. on Sunday and finished it about 15 minutes ago), I attribute that fact to the lesser fact that the third book was always my favorite, and probably still is. 
 I remember when the fourth Harry Potter book came out. It was ginormous, and much like the Twilight fad of High School, many simple-minded readers felt proud to carry a large book around and consider themselves literary. I enjoyed the fourth book, of course--the action-packed tri-wizard tournament was enough to engross any young mind for hours on end (I think it took me eight days to read it the first time in fifth grade...). But there was something about the third novel that captivated me. 
 I still think it has a lot to do with the fact that the third novel has very little to do with the Voldemort plot line. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named never makes an appearance in the third novel, and the only connection to him occurs in the last few chapters, but is mainly overshadowed by the fact that Sirius (ultra-cool new godfather character) is introduced. 
 I loved the third book due to its focus on the wizarding world. Rowling goes into much more classroom depth, Hogsmeade is introduced, and there is very little ""action"" in the first 350 pages, besides the occasional, ""What's that big black dog over there doing?"" and ""A dementor! I fainted!"" The wizarding world is what I enjoyed most about the novels as a child. I remember getting frustrated with Harry, Ron, and (especially) Hermione, every time they poked their nose into something much larger than themselves. I probably could have happily read about them going to Potions class for seven novels. Rowling really develops the wizarding world in the third novel, which captivated me at all ages. 
 Oh, yeah, there was one other reason that I loved the third novel so much: Hermione's overachieving is really emphasized. Oh, dear, how I drooled over Hermione when I was younger. She was my fictional hero. I admired how she was a diligent student, loyal, brave when she needed to be, and wasn't a girly girl (she still may be kind of a role model. Reading about Hermione these past couple days made me sad I wasn't in school anymore. I loved how, in the third book, she signed up for so many classes that she needed a Time Turner to attend them all). 
 Although the action-packed Harry Potter novels are fun, and really emphasize the good versus evil rivalry, I stick to my nine year old guns and still consider the third novel my favorite for its lack of adventure. I enjoy the descriptions of sugar-tipped quills and secret passages; chocolate medicine and boggarts in the closet; Divination and Firebolts. It's those intricacies that really brought the wizard world to life for me, and still does."
2,"If you haven't read The Hound of the Baskervilles, and want to, don't read this book first. It's full of spoilers--as in the MC tells the whole story, red herrings, solution and all. 
 This title caught my eye a year or so ago, so I picked it up--and put it down again. It starts with the death of a dog by gardening fork. Not the sort of thing to read on a sleepless night. 
 Fast forward to last week when one of my ESL students told me she had to read it for class. 
 Sigh. 
 So I picked it up and read it over this four-day weekend. 
 It was less unpleasant than I feared, but by no means enjoyable. Two stars because it wasn't as bad as I feared but that doesn't mean I liked it. I didn't. 
 I found myself skimming long mathematically-oriented passages. Yes, I know, Christopher's a math and science whiz, but I barely passed algebra, and that was with special tutoring. I also got tired of the author's ""there is no God and here's why"" not-so-hidden agenda. 
 He lets himself down occasionally, particularly by telling the reader over and over again that Christopher cannot lie or imagine things, because imagination is not real...and then we are treated to Christopher's imagining himself on a spacecraft, or on a submarine, or imagining an end-of-the-world scenario...okaaaay. Character coherence, please? How can Christopher's mother be a secretary with all those misspellings? They're not the character's mistakes, as the rest of the book is perfectly spelled. 
 None of the main characters was remotely sympathetic. 
 I read it because I had to. 
 Mercifully, it was very short."
5,"What a terribly disturbing book! It's honestly like nothing I have read before. 
 You is about Joe who falls madly and obsessively in love with a girl who walks into his store. However, the book is written from his point-of-view so for some twisted way the reader can't help but to root for him. 
 On the cover the writing style of Caroline Kepnes is compared to that of Patricia Highsmith (who I don't know) and Bret Easton Ellis whose writing I loathe. For the people who feel the same way about Ellis, don't worry! Even though it's written from the point of view of a disturbed psychopath Joe is nothing like the characters in Ellis' books! 
 I guess you'll have to read this novel to understand what I'm talking about! I finished this one on my trip through South Korea, the second book is waiting for me at home!"
5,I cried while reading it. I laughed. I loved it.
4,"Awhile ago I got into watching old Siskel & Ebert movie review clips on Youtube, and one of the films they reviewed was Two Men and a Little Lady. I remember Ebert said he felt terrible for saying it, but that he really didn't like the actress who played the titular little lady. Siskel agreed, but they were laughing, because you're never supposed to dislike a kid, right? They're small, cute, innocent...they didn't do anything to us. 
 But, alas. I am not a saint. 
 I thought Jack was annoying as a narrator. 
 That is the sort of comment I really hate when other people make, because it negates the entire purpose of the book. It means that I missed the point completely. This is definitely a novel that is based more on craft and perspective than on subject, but the problem is, I really cared more about the subject. 
 Room is a novel told from the perspective of 5-year-old Jack, who's mother (called only Ma) was kidnapped at age 19 and forced to live in an eleven-by-eleven shed in the backyard of a psychopath. Jack's whole world is Room--he eats his meals, bathes, watches TV, and learns how to read and write in Room. He doesn't know anything else--but Ma certainly does, and she plans to get them out of there. 
 Ma is one of the most interesting, intelligent, and inspirational characters I've read in a long time. She's insanely inventive, making games and lessons for her son, raising him to be a loving and kind person while she is being raped in captivity for seven years. We are always on her side--her hope is fierce and we can sense her urgency and panic. She never once falters in her need to get out of the room, and we experience her desperation through Jack. We are rooting so badly for them to get out of there that it is incredibly hard to be sympathetic towards Jack, who does not want to leave the safety of his Room. Ma exudes this sort of endless strength that we don't often get from characters, especially characters who have been through trauma. Ma survived the Room and gained her freedom, and I often wished that she was just the narrator of this story and it was a contemporary lit/thriller type of novel. 
 Having a child narrator is an ambitious and difficult feat, especially in an adult novel. And the main issue I have is with the pacing. It takes a long time for Jack to grasp ideas--stairs, pancake syrup, buying things at the store, playing on a playground--and instead of being involved with him, I got easily bored. There was also so much repetition, which makes sense for a little boy who lived by such a structured daily schedule, but we can only hear about him peeing/pooing/""having some"" (breastfeeding) so many times before it gets annoying. And this is not a fault in writing or the story, but a fault in the reader--I just don't have the patience for this type of narration. 
 Narration and pacing issues aside, this novel touches on so many topics that really can't be dealt with outside the situation, which was interesting. For example, Jack was raised by a loving and kind mother in a world with only two people, so there are things in our world--families of different races, the concept of divorce and step-parents, same-sex couples, people with mental illness--that do not faze him at all. One could argue that if raised in the right homes, all children can see the world that way, but over time, the world influences children and teaches them to parrot back bigotry and prejudice they see on the news, hear at school, etc. Jack is more concerned about why he cannot breastfeed anymore or why he cannot hug his brand-new friend at the library. 
 Without Jack narrating, this story would easily fall into the legal drama/revenge thriller type novel, filled with lawyers and police officers and courtroom scenes. Part of me wouldn't mind this story in that setting. But the other part of me knows that this is the type of story we will read again and again, in the news and on the book shelves, but it will never be told quite this way again--focused on adaptation, new beginnings, and the overcoming of fear. I may not have liked Jack, but I've certainly never read anything like this."
4,"Wow. I just finished the book, but I think I'm going to be absorbing it for a while longer. It was quite wonderful. I really liked how Zusak tells the story from Death's point of view, complete with gallows humor and a quaint way of speaking which made me view everyday things a little differently. Liezel's story would have been touching and powerful on its own, but having Death as a narrator brings this book to a whole new level. I liked how that perspective made the reader react a little like the characters themselves: even during Hitler's insanity, there must have been moments when life was fun and hopeful and perfect, but only for a brief time. Before they could get too comfortable, Death would come around again and the harsh reality of Nazi Germany would drag them down once more. Highly recommended."
5,"This was such a good and pure adventure story! It definitely didn't lead to where I expected it to, and was all the more enjoyable for that as it kept me hanging on right until the end. I was scared at points that a romance was going to sneak in there, but it held off as just a thought and the story returns to focusing on friendship and adventure. It was all beautiful and I teared up a lot at the ending. 
 Not to mention how beautiful the physical book itself actually is!"

 #bookstruggles 
 stars: 3.5 
 *sighs* Take 2: 
 I really enjoyed this book but I felt as though somethings were just a little bit off. Everything was done well but there's just that little nagging feeling that something was missing. 
 This novel is about a girl named Caymen who lives with her mother on top of there porcelain doll store called: ""Dolls and More"" 
 Her family is struggling to make ends meet as Caymen's father left them and her mother's parents basically disowned my mother for having a kid out of wedlock. It's just the two of them. 
 Then Caymen meets a boy. (duh). They're different, yet the same. Xander's family is rich and they own a chain of really successful hotels. While sales aren't going so well on Caymen's side of things. They are behind on bills and she even skips school to help her mother work at the doll store. 
 But while they are so different they both find common ground. They don't want to do what their families want them to do. Caymen doesn't want to work at the doll store and Xander doesn't want to take over the family business. 
 Stuff happens and there a couple plot twists. 
 I can't tell you anything for or else you would already know everything. But if you have read the book, or don't mind spoilers... proceed. 
 ----------------------------------------- 
 I liked this book i really did. The book was witty and really enjoyable. but, there where somethings that put me off. 
 1) Did Caymen's mom have another job part time? because she should have. Caymen worked at Dolls and More 75% of the time i would say. Which gives her mother fee time to get another job. Money is tight. I know they both work really hard but they were $3000 behind. THREE THOUSAND. 
 2) In the end, it kinda implies that Xander did take on the family business which i though was weird. Their common ground was them both wanting to break the mold. They Even tested out careers that they could do together, and he ending up just doing what his dad wanted? what. 
 3) speaking of Xander's dad. Did he actually like Caymen or was it because he knew her grandparents were rich? Because seemed really friendly but Xander described him all cold and stern. 
 4) Caymen's mother should have tried to make amends with her grandparents. I get that it's tough to speak to someone who has shut you out, but it's for the sake of your daughter. 
 5) when Caymen got to meet her grandparents, her grandparents didn't apologize to her or her parents. I thought it was too weirdly content. 
 While there where those ^^ there were good things too 
 Caymen is a really interesting narrator and her sarcasm and sense of humor is hilarious to me. She's also super relatable. 
 Is that your subtle way of saying you missed me last week?"" 
 ""I've missed my hot chocolate. I just think of you as the guy who brings it to me. Sometimes I forget your name and call you hot chocolate guy."" 
 Caymen works so hard and she's just an awesome character. 
 The interactions with xander are so cute and thoughtful. The shawdowing careers stuff made me 'awwww' especially when they were digging graves. haha 
 ""So Caymen..."" 
 ""So, Xander..."" 
 ""Like the islands."" 
 ""What?"" 
 ""Your name. Caymen. Like the Cayman Islands. Is that your mom's favourite place to visit or something?"" 
 ""No, it's her third favourite place. I have an older brother named Paris and an older sister named Sydney."" 
 ""Wow."" He opens the bag, takes out a muffin, and hands it to me. The top glistens with sprinkled sugar. ""Really?"" 
 I gently unwrap it. ""No."" 
 I really liked skye and mason and toad. They were such fun characters and they just added so much for life to the story. 
 ""You two are the most in-love not-dating people I've met."" 
 The book was cute and made me smile but i would say that pivot point was better. I look forward to reading split second in the near future :D"
4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 Of course she had to kill off two of my favourite characters. I guess it did make the battle seem more realistic, but I really did like Konstantin. And Ember was so sweet! Her last moments were just sad. Meaningful, but sad. I liked seeing a bit more of the other kingdoms in this novel. Oh, and Wendy! Although she felt very authoritative and distant. I guess because we are seeing her through Bryn's eyes. Loki was totally awesome though. Him and Konstantin are kinda dreamy. I must admit that Konstantin and Bryn felt like less awesome rip-offs of Rose and Dimitri. I wouldn't be surprised if Amanda Hocking got some of her inspiration for this trilogy from Vampire Academy. It's still pretty good though! I flew through it in one sitting and put off eating for a few hours because of it. 4/5"
5,"I loved it! 
 More tomorrow."
3,"The sequel is Ok overall, but what really managed to bother me this time was the scarcity of the vocabulary employed in exclamations - there were literally thousands of uses for ""bleeding"" as a non-literal adjective, ""skies"" and ""hells"" ad nauseam (i.e. ""ten bleeding hells"", ""Skies only knows"", ""how in the ten hells"" etc) - this, to me, is one of the biggest turn-offs when reading a book and oozes poor writing style. To make matters worse, it definitely causes all characters to sound the same - something I believe you'd particularly wish to avoid as a writer if you choose to develop the narrative through alternating POVs. Why I did not notice this bad habit of the author in the first book of the series still baffles me, but fortunately it does not manage to completely ruin the storyline, which is fine in itself, except for some underdeveloped side stories and inconsistencies / plot holes. 
 The pace is swift as always and the tension is well dosed, therefore the page-turner potential."
4,"This book pulls you in from the first word and does not let go until the end leaving you in desperate need of more. Along the way you are met with characters so well constructed that you could swear they were all real and right there with you. It is non-stop but not in a such a way as to leave you exhausted by constant action or angst. Bracken is evidently a talented story teller and she has forged a story with the perfect amount of mystery, suspense, emotion, and adventure. You will not regret trying this book out."
3,"Not quite as good as its predecessor, but still enjoyable. I love how it reads like a movie script rather than a novel, and you can almost hear Kate's narration in your head while you read."
4,"If I were a vampire, I would totally want to go around killing assholes. It would be awesome to cure society's ills every time I wanted a snack. Maybe I'd even make some sort of spandex suit with a giant V on the front and be some sort of superhero vigilante. That would be sweet. 
 And, have you ever noticed how wealthy vampires in all these books seem to be? They live in mansions, drive cars that cost more than my house, wear designer everything... and yet they don't have jobs. What the hell? 
 But, with my luck, I would end up one of those vampires from Sookie Stackhouse and get stuck living in some shitty trailer park working the night shift at Walmart. 
 If you don't know about Shane, the Walmart employee, you need to check it out. He's my hero! 
 http://www.foodbeast.com/news/this-wa... 
 Anyway, these vampires are the rich kind. And, they don't kill for sport. Boring! 
 In this book, we have Tegan, a totally badass warrior who lost his wife hundreds of years ago and is an emotionless hardened killer. He really is my favorite of all of the guys. Something about his cold, unsympathetic heart really makes me swoon. 
 Tegan gets involved with Elise, a lady who lost her husband and son and is on a mission to kill as many minions as she can as revenge. 
 Sorry, guys, you are too played out. Time for you to die. 
 They get thrown together because Elise stumbles upon information that will help the brotherhood order figure out what the bad guys are up to. Bad guys always have nefarious schemes that include lots of paperwork and clues for the good guys to find. It's convenient, really. (ever heard of going paperless, guys?) 
 I like both of the main characters, and the story is still good fun. I'm looking forward to the next book."
5,"Hmmm... I'm not really sure how I feel about this book. I think its my favourite out of all the 6 books in the series but... I don't know, I still need to think about it. And I need sleep. !MALEC 4EVER! guys."
3,OK. so IMO that was by far one of the best books in that series. 3.5[?]
4,Review to come.
4,"I really enjoyed this story. Starts out a little slow with the typical cops pretending to be straight to cover up their feelings for each other, who then have to go undercover as a gay couple. Scott and Will are so good together. Their funny banter had me laughing out loud more than once. When they get together, they sizzle. Throw in the mystery they are trying to solve, and poor Todd who they are trying to help, and this is a winner. I thought I had it figured out, but was pleasantly surprised to be wrong. And the ending? I hate not being able to jump right into the sequel when a book ends the way this one does. I think I have it figured out again though, so I hope the wait isn't too long."
4,Read this to my now-grown son and taught it to my high school students. Enjoyable. Worthwhile.
4,"This is a unique book; the illustrations are an integral part of the story. It's a good story and a fun book to read. I can see how it could really encourage reluctant readers--without having to struggle with thousands of words, they can read (and enjoy)a really big book!"
5,"I've been really pleased with the quality of romances I've been randomly selecting to read lately. I had no expectations about the quality of this book by an author I've never heard of, although I was attracted to the pretty and well laid-out cover. 
 It was enjoyable enough that I really did read it slowly, trying to prolong the entertainment. 
 Minnie is a smart, practical leading lady who shows great courage in facing her demons. Robert is a love interest for her who is admirable and strong but has vulnerabilities that make the role she ends up playing in his life so wonderfully satisfying. And this is a romance that doesn't just cut off at the steamy wedding night scene, but goes on long enough to make it believable that they could stay together long-term. 
 There's a great cast of additional characters, too. Minnie has a friend she seems to treasure about as much as her love interest. Robert's family and friends are hilarious, and have their own compelling stories. This book is the rare genuinely funny romance, as opposed to the romances that are funny because they're ridiculous. 
 (view spoiler)[It also has the most realistic - in a literary sense - wedding night scene I remember reading. Normally, the woman is supposed to be swept away by the man's virile force. It's nice to see a man get carried away and fail to consider his partner's needs, and a woman who is confident enough to step up and show him how to fix things. And a man who is expecting clouds and rainbows from sex with his True Love, no less! (hide spoiler)] 
 The story gets a bit convoluted towards the end, but not to the point where I felt it was too ridiculous. It was satisfying to read something so unique, where plot threads introduced earlier felt like they had been carefully planted to tie everything together perfectly at the end. 
 I got this book as a free deal for my Kindle library. I will definitely be investing money in the rest of the series and more by the author."
4,"Gone Girl, by Gillian Flynn 
 and 1/2 (rounding up to 4) 
 Synopsis: On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne's fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick's clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn't doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife's head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media--as well as Amy's fiercely doting parents--the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he's definitely bitter--but is he really a killer? 
 As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn't do it, where is that beautiful wife? And what was in that silvery gift box hidden in the back of her bedroom closet? 
 In A Sentence: This book scares me... 
 My Thoughts: So this book is effed up (excuse my language, but it really is). I spent the first half of the book feeling really depressed. I felt like I could relate to Amy; it seemed like her reactions were the same as mine would be, and I had to keep telling myself ""Dave and I are happily married...Dave and I are happily married."" I even felt compelled to snuggle up to my husband and ask him if he was happy with our relationship as it was. I began to feel like I wasn't going to enjoy this book after all, despite the assurances of other people claiming it was a creepy story. 
 ....And then the second half started. And I found myself quickly going from feeling depressed to feeling absolutely disturbed. And the ending...that was the creepiest part! I refuse to spoil anything. Suffice it to say that this book holds up to all of the reviews I've read. I also refuse to say that I liked it. The book deserves a high rating; it successfully tricked me into thinking I knew the ending, and manipulated my emotions to the point that I needed comfort from my husband. But I can't like the story; it's disturbing, and depressing, and now that I've finished it, I still need my husband to hold me and say that everything is all right. 
 So on that note, this is a good, dark psychological thriller. I will not ruin the experience for you by explaining why, I only say that if you like dark novels, then you should definitely read this. And do not give up reading the book if the first 200 pages turns you off; trust me, the first half is a setup. It's the second half that will keep you glued to the book."
4,"Vivi Angelino is on a mission to get the name of her new company known. She decides to approach famous actress, Cara Ferrari, about working as a body double in order to protect her from a possible serial killer. When Cara agrees, Vivi finds herself disguised as Cara and under the protection of Special Agent Colt Lang. They've worked together before and she knows hiding her identity will be even harder than hiding how bad she has the hots for him. Colton has always thought Vivi was cute, but won't get close to another woman who is a risk taker in order to protect his heart. The sexual tension grows almost as quickly as the danger in this edge of your seat page turner. 
 Holy cow! The chemistry between Vivi and Colt is seriously HOT! I didn't expect Colt to be such a stud, but I'm smitten. I couldn't get enough of these two. I don't usually go for the preppy type, but I'm crushing on Colt in a bad, bad way. Thankfully he doesn't let his straight laced demeanor carry over into the romance department of his life, but his intense nature never waivers. This is definitely a good thing if you're the girl he is getting intense with ;) I've loved Vivi since I first met her in Shiver of Fear, but never would have guessed based on her fun loving demeanor how much emotional baggage the poor girl is carrying. She hides her past traumas behind her sassy attitude and tomboy attire. Colt could not be a more perfect match for her even if his rule following and khaki wearing self couldn't be more different from Vivi. She deserves a man that makes her feel safe, and Colt is qualified to do just that. 
 Some parts of this book are really graphic and down right heartbreaking. A very emotional read without a doubt. There isn't anything fluffy about this romance novel. The author tackles tough topics, but balances out the plot perfectly with well timed romantic rendezvous to keep it from getting too heavy. 
 I'm 100% addicted to this big Italian family, and can't wait to see where their adventures take them next!"
4,"Let me start off by saying that Kiss of a Demon King is closely tied to another book in the series, Dark Desires After Dusk. To read this book you don't need to have followed the whole series, but I strongly recommend reading the book that I just mentioned. It is the story of Cade, Rydstrom's brother, and has a few scenes that are a duplicate of those in this story. Also, they basically follow the same time line and involve most of the same people. 
 Sabine, Queen of Illusions, is half-sister to Omort the Deathless. She's in a pretty messy situation. She and her sister, Lanthe, have been stuck with Omort because of the poison he has that they need to live. Omort is not her favorite person, and he's creeping her out with his incestuous lusting. She's determined to get her sister and her out from under Omort's thumb. She believes she has the perfect opportunity in Rydstrom. Omort knows of a prophecy that tells of Sabine being Rydstrom's mate. The child they produce together will unlock the secrets of the Well of Souls. He plans to have Sabine capture him and get herself pregnant. Sabine, being the ruthless individual she is, is totally ok with this plan. She knows that this is her perfect chance to take control. If she has a child she can unlock the Well of Souls for her own use. Better a queen of Rothkalina rather than a king anyway, right? 
 For Rydstrom's part he's determined to kill Omort and regain his crown. He believes he's finally answered the question of how to kill someone who is deathless. He starts his brother, Cade, on the search for the Vessel and plans to meet up with him. Unfortunately he gets caught in one of Sabine's illusions and becomes trapped in his own castle's dungeon. He's none too pleased about that and is incredulous over Sabine's plan. Unfortunately for her, even if she got pregnant the child wouldn't be recognized unless they were married first. While Sabine is plotting them getting married and getting pregnant, Rydstrom is plotting on how to get free and enact his own revenge against her. 
 I know that many people found Sabine unlikable, but I didn't. I was impressed with her `look out for number one' attitude. She's died again and again throughout her life. I'd think she was a fool if she wasn't always plotting about how to turn a situation to her advantage. I loved that she was able to move beyond the fact that her group, the Sorceri, weren't very strong compared to the rest of the Lore. I really liked the fact that she stayed basically the same character throughout the book. As she and Rydstrom got closer they had to adapt and be willing to bend with each other, but never did either of them break some supposed `bad' trait in each other. Very refreshing. 
 Rydstrom was less of a favorite character for me. However, I think it's because I sympathized with Cade more in the last book and thought his brother was a butthead. I guess I never really got over that. I liked that I got to see his point of view on the reasons that Cade got sent away. The reminiscing over little Cade made me have an `awwwww' moment for Rydstrom. I actually liked that Rydstrom was such a stick in the mud in the beginning. I think he and Sabine really complimented each other. I love that Cole did not make Rydstrom a martyr. I loved the insight into how he sometimes felt the burden of his people and all their expectations. I thought that was very realistic. 
 I guess my major dislike about the book was the ending. All that buildup through various books and the fight for Rothkalina is over? Hmmmm... Very unsatisfying. I thought I'd get more than a page of the fight. I had to re-read to make sure I hadn't skipped something. Very anticlimactic. Also, all this time was devoted to Rydstrom's kinky fantasies and there seemed to be no follow through. There was one spanking scene but that was it. I wondered why the kinkiness was brought up so often if nothing was going to be done with it. 
 One thing I really loved: A reason for being a virgin that makes sense. Finally! Also, someone who admits to being a virgin in only the technical sense. I thought that was more realistic than most virgins (or near virgins) who hated anything to do with sex because of one bad experience. 
 I'm also so glad that the titles have stopped being so similar. I was getting really confused!"
4,"I actually liked this one more than the first!! 
 I really wasn't sure where they were going to go in the second book of the Caster Chronicles but I loved that it was from Ethan's point of view, though I kind of wish it would have been from both because there were a lot of times I wanted to know why Lena was doing what she was doing. 
 I really liked this one more because there wasn't so much civil war flashbacks in this one which was my main annoyance in the first one. I generally enjoyed getting deeper into the story as well and I really look forward to reading more in the series!! 
 Great read! Great eye grabbing cover!"
4,"I vaguely remember checking this out of the library in the early 80s but don't remember finishing it, so this doesn't really count as a re-read. A GR friend reminded me of its existence, and I enjoyed it as a quick, light weekend read. Beauty's request for rose seeds from town puts her father's life in danger unless she will go and live with The Beast. 
 Beauty is more like her given name (Honour) than her nickname; as in all good fairytales she is the youngest and least attractive, but thoroughly decent. She'd rather go into exile than see her family hurt. She and her family live in a nameless nation in no specific time, but which must be 16th century England as she has read parts of Spenser's The Faerie Queene. The only mild annoyance I felt was when Beauty uses the word ""Okay"" which was unknown at that time in that place; she should have said something like ""all right"". Also, the books in the library were unnecessary and annoying, unless there's a whole underlying magical world we are going to be let in on--which we aren't. 
 It is what it is: a retelling of a fairytale, better than many on the current market. McKinley can write a whole novel without a single grammatical mistake! It held my attention and entertained without requiring too much of me, which was what I wanted this weekend."
3,"There was a big gap between when I actually started this book and finishing it. I kind of abandoned it over the holidays. By the time I had recovered from said holidays and realized I haven't finished this book I was pretty close to the end. The end definitely grabbed me though and things were clicking into place about the story even though it had been over a month since I had read most of it. If you liked the Percy Jackson series, this is worth reading."
1,"DNF because I'm sorry, but I find it a little hard to believe that someone who's known a set of brothers (even if they're identical twins) for years can't tell apart AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. I mean, seriously."
3,"3.5 stars 
 After reading this book followed by a long contemplation, I settled for a 3.5 rating. I think it really deserves that - it's good enough not to be rated a three but at the same time, not that good enough for me, to give it a dashing four stars (This is a problem that has been pestering me for a while now hence the half star.). 
 Pushing the Limits is a story about two teens who both suffered their own tribulations in the past and while overcoming them, found their way to one another. It has something in the story that makes it surpass its cliched romance - good girl falls in love with bad boy, vice versa. The relationship between the two protagonists is very different to the typical ones most teenagers have nowadays. It isn't an insta-love; there was time and understanding between the two of them that made the romance between them gradually blossom. It was their awareness that both of them suffered tragedies in the past yet still, they found their way in accepting one another. 
 ""Because growing up means making tough choices, and doing the right thing doesn't necessarily mean doing the thing that feels good."" 
 What I really admired about this book is the authenticity of both its plot and its characters. All of us have our own issues in life and though mine and yours may be inferior to theirs, I still felt their hurt and pain and their yearning to conquer them. The characters are believable to me that I felt connected with them somehow. 
 Though it is a very emotional novel, not all parts are sad. In fact, it was what made me read the novel in the first place. Even though the romance between the characters didn't appeal to me that much, still, Pushing the Limits taught me that despite our problems in life, we still find hope through them and we never give up."
5,"Dark & twisty but really good. I liked Ash & Seth their tension was sweet. Keenan ugh! I would love him if It weren't for his casual use if the summer girls, he's a man whore. LOVED Donia and of course no Faery Tale would be complete without an evil queen. A fun but dark tale of Faery mischief."
3,"Find this review and more at On The Shelf 
 In Timeless, Michele Windsor has a wonderful life with her mother until a car accident takes her mother from her and she is thrown into a life with the rich Windsor family she never met. Her mother's parents take her in and she has a giant life change in this new upper class society she never thought she would experience. Michele comes to possess a key that matches one from a dream she had and finds herself hurled into the past after reading a diary she found. Not only does she meet other Windsor's from the past, but also a boy she can't help feeling a magnetism toward. 
 I was very excited about a romantic story between two people from very different times; surprisingly, not as much of the story was focused on this aspect like I had hoped. Most of the book is centered around her trips to the past and helping her long gone relatives, so I would have liked to have seen more of the love story. I enjoyed the author's descriptions of old New York when Michele was in the past; she does a great job in her imagery. 
 Monir is a first time novelist, and she is a song writer; I like how she wove some lyrics and musical elements into the story since I am a music person myself (I was in band all throughout school). She does well with the relationships between characters and breaking down their emotional barriers. The sequel will be released sometime next year and I can't wait to see how the love story aspect plays out and to see how the rest of the mysteries unfold. 
 Not a lot in the love department, lovely descriptions, mysterious."
4,"Rating: 3.5 out of 5 
 This is one of my favorite long running series, and I've always liked Kai and Nathan since the novella that introduces us to them. I would have rated this book a bit higher, but I felt the beginning was really bogged down with complicated discussion of the magic. The second half was excellent - really fast-paced and hard to put down. I'm just not sure that this book in the series will be one that I'll reread frequently, unlike Blood Challenge, Tempting Danger, and Mortal Sins. 
 I'd definitely recommend this book for fans of the series, but if you haven't read the other books, this might not be the place for you to start."
4,"4 stars because most of the stories are just ok. 
 BUT CAN WE TALK ABOUT LAINI TAYLOR'S STORY?! Laini Taylor doesn't write stories she crafts magic. Reading ""The girl who woke the dreamer"" is like being enveloped in an ethereal cloud that swathes you in warmth and happiness which is a testament to just how amazing a writer she is. 
 Special mention must go to Holly Black, I loved Krampuslauf. Ally Carter had a good little mystery going, Rainbow Rowell had a cute little romance to kick the book off and Jenny Han's story really left me wanting to know what happened next but the rest of the stories, to be completely honest were a bit boring. Many I simply skimmed through. 
 Great little book to get you in the Holiday spirit!"
2,"""City of Bones"" may be the most generic urban fantasy ever written. Sure, there are urban fantasy stories that are generic in a specific way... but none manage to gather almost ALL tropes under their umbrella. 
 As a result, the first book of Cassandra Clare's Mortal Instruments series feels a lot like the unholy love child of Joss Whedon, ""Twilight,"" JK Rowling, Sherrilyn Kenyon and.... every single ""supernatural world you mortals don't see"" series ever created, including vampires, werewolves, faeries and all the other typical stuff. Clare does have a strong writing talent and a knack for writing grotesque monsters and action scenes, but that can't overcome the massive plot holes and obnoxious characters. 
 Teenage Clary Fray's life is becoming very complicated -- she's seeing demon-slaying warriors that no one else can see, and her mother Jocelyn is planning to leave New York for the countryside... right before she vanishes without a trace. And after a nasty close encounter with a Ravener demon, Clary finds herself in the hands of the Shadowhunters, part-angel warriors charged with protecting the ordinary human ""mundanes"" (despite having nothing but contempt for them). 
 As she falls in love with the perpetually-snarking Jace, Clary continues her quest to find Jocelyn and discover why her mother has been kidnapped. The answer seems to be tied up in a long-ago war between factions of Shadowhunters, and a mysterious artifact called the Mortal Cup -- and as Clary discovers the terrible truth about her mother's past, she finds that the greatest enemy of the Shadowhunters may not be as dead as they assumed. 
 It's not hard to see why ""City of Bones"" has garnered bestsellerdom -- it's another story about an ordinary girl discovering she is in fact a superior kind of being (or destined to become one), and falling in love with a hot boy while trying to save the world. But unlike ""Twilight"" and its ilk, it also has plenty of action and suspense -- slaying demons with whips and ""seraph blades,"" knife fights, and the occasional battle between (of course) vampires and werewolves. 
 And let's be fair here: Clare is not a bad writer by any means. Her writing style is robust and nimble, and she has a knack for evoking magical imagery (Portals, the demons, the seraph blades, the runes) and the sometimes-grandiose surroundings of the characters (Clary lives in a regal, decayed brownstone). And she has some clever ideas, even though her worldbuilding is often scattershot (why are the only Shadowhunters in New York a trio of teenagers and a guy who can't leave his home?). 
 However, her writing desperately needed a few more runs through the editor's office, because the overabundance of glitter and sexy clothes gets tiring, and she makes some painfully obvious writing mistakes (Isabelle's ""red pendant"" is described as ""real and precious"" -- so it's a real... red item?). And worst of all... the snark. It's abundantly clear that Clare is a big fan of Joss Whedon's writing style, because she tries to insert Whedon-style snarky dialogue all over the book... but it falls as flat as a pancake, and sometimes directly undermines the sense of urgency she's trying to generate. 
 Which brings us to the characters, who often awkwardly mouth that snark. Clary is a completely standard young-adult-fantasy heroine -- she's not very bright, she has a Secret Past/Destiny that she is unaware of, and she's beautiful without knowing it. Sadly, she's also rather self-absorbed and impressionable, since she manages to completely absorb the Shadowhunters' racism after knowing them for only a few days. Yes, the Shadowhunters are very bigoted towards everyone who isn't like them... and this isn't really seen as a bad thing. 
 As for Jace, he has exactly two moods: sneering snark, and emo wangst. He flips between these two at random, attempting to make us pity him while failing to be charmingly witty. Alec is also apparently supposed to elicit sympathy because he's a closeted gay teen, but his violent misogyny and seething jealousy kill any sympathy I might have had for him. The only likable characters end up being Simon and Isabelle, since Simon is one of the few nice, unselfish people in the story, and Isabelle one of the few Shadowhunters who doesn't treat him like garbage. 
 ""City of Bones"" is graced with some pretty good writing and ideas, but the patchy worldbuilding and obnoxious characters sink the promise that it initially had. As a result, you just get an ambitious but generic fantasy that could have been much more."
5,"So, I don't really read comic books that much. I'm not against them per se, I just don't seem to find any that really speak to me, not in the way novels do. 
 Well, Saga looks like it might be the exception to the rule. I borrowed the first two volumes from someone and within the first couple of pages I was completely hooked. 
 So the action starts on Cleave, a planet that has been co-opted into a galaxy-wide war between a planet, Landfall, and its moon, Wreath, where two soldiers from opposite sides of the war have fallen in love and deserted their armies. In the opening scenes they become parents and immediately have to go on the run to protect their newborn daughter because it seems the entire galaxy is after them. 
 This book honestly had it all. Action, plot, characterisation, humour, great art ... Colour me completely impressed. The whole world (galaxy) that Brian Vaughan and Fiona Staples have created is unbelievably creative - every few pages I was wowing over another really cool thing they'd produced. The worldbuilding gives you a perfect amount of insight into the galaxy without it feeling infodumpy. 
 Despite the fact this volume is quite short and you're only learning about stuff with pictures and dialogue, I thought there was masses of action and a well developed plot. And the characterisation is brilliant. Ask me how much I love Alana and Marko. The answer is: a lot. And I liked that the whole thing is narrated by Hazel, Alana and Marko's baby, memoir-style. 
 The story is a perfect balance of humour and emotion with some bizarre, crazy-imaginative inventions. My highlights: tree spaceship, lie detector cat, dismembered ghost babysitters, seahorse people, assassins and the coolest husband and wife team ever. 
 5 stars"

4,"I'm in the mood to read books with Mafia in it. Thank you to my lovely sis Pearl(click her name to read her review) for recommending this book to me! 
 The title for this book lived up to its characters. Melody Nicci Giovanni - an Italian Mafia Boss, Orlando Giovanni's successor and Liam Alec Callahan - an Irish Mafia Boss, Sedric Callahan's successor are ruthless. These two tied the knot arranged by their fathers to make both families more powerful. It's not easy for them to get along because originally, they are rivals and the tension between them is so high they almost kill each other. They're so like Mr. & Mrs. Smith - both dominant, ready to kill each other and unleash the sexual tension. As they get to know more about each other, they learned a lot by working as a team. Also, love one another in the most unusual way. 
 There's a lot of brutality, killing and profanity in this book and I have a love / hate relationship on the main characters. First, they are really reckless and love giving threats on anyone, sometimes just shoot them out of nowhere. Then, I'm so annoyed on their constant throwing of F-BOMBS and bickering like children. Despite of that, I'm really entertained with the action scenes and they are all badass. No matter what happens, they are going to protect each other. Mess with one of them, you'll get a dose of their merciless actions. The side characters intriguing especially Declan and Coraline (yes to Coraline!) and I've got to admit they're more interesting. 
 Overall, I really enjoyed this book and I am looking forward what happens next because the last part opens a lot of twists."
3,"A quick purchase and a quick read from Amazon. It really doesn't matter how I end up loving each individual story of Hill's: I can't help myself and have to keep reading everything he churns out! 
 This story was bittersweet...but lovely. Something about unsettles my core. But Hill is always so good at doing that."
5,O MY GOD. New fave.
5,"Reread via Audiobook 4/13/2015 - 4/26/2015. 
 First read 8/14/2014-8/16/2014. 
 Review after first read: 
 I just LOVED Attachments! I was a little worried because I didn't like 
 Eleanor & Park 
 as much as everyone else did, but I kept wanting to try more Rainbow Rowell. And her adult books looked promising so I thought I'd begin with her debut novel. And yep, she freaking nailed it. 
 Just What Did I LOVE about Attachments.. hmm? 
 Lost Late Twenty-Year-Old Finding His Way: In a lot of ways, I feel like Lincoln does at his job. I just feel unfulfilled... I have approximately 30min- an hour worth of actual work during the day and I try to stretch that out over 8 1/2 hours. Most of the time I blog, read other blogs, and dink around on the internet in ways that don't look too suspicious. I work in a super small office, so there is no Lincoln around tracking my behavior. I don't have a Jennifer to talk to to make the days go faster. 
 ""What did he have to mope about, really? What more did he want?...Love. Purpose. Those are the things that you can't plan for. Those are the things that just happen. And what if they don't happen? Do you spend your whole life pining for them? Waiting to be happy?"" 
 Seeing Lincoln make changes in his life to better himself, figuring out his purpose, and not just standing around waiting for things to get better was inspiring. It made me realize that you just can't WAIT for things to get better, you have to take steps... Lincoln's sister said it PERFECTLY: 
 ""So, what if, instead of thinking about solving you whole life, you just think about adding additional good things. One at a time. Just let your pile of good things grow."" 
 THIS is why I loved this book. It made me think about my life. It gave me all this good advice, and even though I'm only an almost 24-year-old, I think this was the PERFECT time for me to read this book. 
 The Setting: Okay, so I wasn't a journalism major, but working at a newspaper like Beth and Jennifer did just seems like my IDEAL place of work. I would have loved to be a copy editor 14 sum years ago when newspapers were more popular (and everyone didn't just look at their phones for the news or twitter). I also loved the quirks from being set around the millennium and all the concerns they had about the Y2K bug and policing email/internet at work. 
 The Email Conversations: Beth and Jennifer's emails were wonderful. I loved reading them, and that's why you just CAN""T judge Lincoln for reading them. Their friendship was simply the best. They compared celebrity crushes, talked about falling in love, dealt with Jennifer fearing pregnancy, and covered such a wonderful range of hilarious and serious topics that furthered the main plot and the side plots. 
 The Love Story: It was sooo romantic the way that Lincoln fell in love with Beth, and I think the thing that kept it from being too creepy was that 1) as readers, we are creeping along with him 2) it's his JOB 3) Beth's crush 
 ""Every woman wants a man who'll fall in love with her soul as well as her body."" 
 You just wanted them to get together the WHOLE TIME and imagining that they wouldn't or that Lincoln would never actually meet her was just TOO MUCH! 
 To Insert Some Objectivity in this Review 
 One of the reasons while adult fiction struggles to pulls me in is because often the pacing is slower than I would like. At first it seemed like Attachments was going to drag on, and I think it needed to feel that way to set the tone of how monotonous Lincoln's life felt. But as her started falling for Beth, and as he was trying to change things in his life, everything just picked up. I needed to know if he and Beth would end up together, and I needed to know if he would move out of his mom's house and finally quit his awful job. (And.... that was my attempt of objectivity... ). 
 Bottom Line: 
 This book is PERFECT for anyone in their twenties who is still trying to figure out their life. The romance is wonderful, but all the questions the book provokes and makes you think about will be in you mind for long after you've set it down.This review was originally posted on A Bottomless Book Bag"
0,"DNF @pg 10 oops. 
 I really enjoyed her book The Night She Disappeared and I was hoping this would be as awesome, but sadly I can't get myself to turn another page. I pick this book up, read a few paragraphs and then put it down again. Clearly, I don't want to read it so I'm dnfing it. There's just something about the writing style if this book and I simply don't like it. 
 I'm not going to rate it bc I've only read ten pages."
4,"So I read the second one first (A Fatal Grace) a while ago, and when this popped up in the donated books pile at work, I nabbed it. These books are really *nice* books, *nice* mysteries without all the blood and gore and formulaic writing that some serial-mystery writers conform to. 
 The town of Three Pines is in Quebec, Canada, a small, intimate town where everyone knows everyone, but in a somehow non-suffocating way. The town is full of artists -- Clara and Peter paint and sculpt, Ruth is an award-winning poet, Gabri and Olivier are a gay couple excellent at antique-spotting and rehabilitation . . . these people are intelligent, likable, and you get to know them as the book progresses and the series progresses. And Armand Gamache is a really interesting Chief Inspector of homicides, and he's so kind, calm, and interesting. 
 Anyhow, if you're looking for a non-gruesome mystery, in a nice, intimate town in Canada, where intelligence, art, and nature abound, then give this series a try. : )"
5,"Having had to read it for school, I'm surprised of how much I actually like this book. The story was inetersting and witha touch of humor and it never felt like a burden reading it, even though it was mandatory. It's a nice story of the type that no one writes anymore,it belong to another time,but that's what makes it so interesting to read. Reccomend!"
3,"I read this a while ago, in 2007 or 2006, I guess. It was okay, but it was one of those books where something ( . . . not that serious at all) made me so angry that I still think about it when I see books by the author. (view spoiler)[That whole chapter where she goes, ""No, I didn't fall in love with him"" and goes on about that for a while and then "" . . . because I'd always been in love with him."" PROBABLY SILLY, BUT THAT BUGGED ME SO MUCH. (hide spoiler)]"
4,Review coming soon!
5,I opened this book and from the moment I started it I couldn't and wouldn't put it down. It took me about four hours to fully read this book and take all of it to heart.
5,"I truly loved this, definitely the best adult angel/fallen angel story I have ever read! Do not hesitate and read it, you won't regret it. 
 My Serah and Luce: 
 Serah is Power angel - she protects the innocent from evil. She believes in goodness and happily serves the God and his purpose. But after her brother becomes fallen angel and she is ordered to establish the truce at the border between ""the righteous and the wicked"", Serah starts to ask herself questions. Questions about what is good and bad, questions about life and humanity, questions that need answers. And the most important question is - how can you cooperate with the Devil himself? 
 Yeah, we all know that Satan (or Lucifer as he prefers to be called) is the bad guy. Rebelling against God, bringing people into temptation, etc... But what if there is more into him? What if there is still a little bit of compassion in him? A little bit of goodness that noone else bothered to look for? Seems like Serah may be the only one seeing hope where other see only damnation. But is it wise to trust the Devil? 
 I have to admit that I was smitten by Luce. He was arrogant, mocking and bitter but never vulgar or disgusting. I knew I should not fall for the Devil himself but I was truly fascinated by him. He was able to push all Sarah's buttons and their banters or discussions made extremely intriguing read out of this book. 
 I am not going to tell you more since I want to avoid spoiling the story for you. But believe me, once you start reading it, you won't be able to put it down! Extinguish is thoughtful story written in brilliant and beautiful writing style which only J.M. Darhower can master. Yeah, I admit it, I have a girl crush on this author and her stories. Everything she writes appeals to me. You simply cannot go wrong with the book by J.M. Darhower! This is her first paranormal story and I loved every single moment of it. 
 Story is wrapped up nicely by the end, there is no cliffhanger but I have a feeling there may be a sequel coming... Who knows? I definitely know that I would be more than happy to come back to this paranormal world and characters J.M. Darhower created in this story.

 Happy Easter to all my friends and followers! I'm so thankful for each and every one of you, and I hope you all have an amazing day filled with love, laughter, and good books! And what better way to celebrate Easter than with some New Adult Erotic Romance CHICK-Lit? 
 (I'll see myself out...) 
 It's been a while since I've read a New Adult book, and I truly forgot how addicting and fast paced they are. And I don't think we should feel guilt for reading anything, but if I have a ""guilty pleasure"" book, it is without question the entire Debt Inheritance Series by Pepper Winters. Her plots are so un-put-down-able, her characters are so fleshed out and real feeling, and her sex scenes are the absolute best. She writes dark and twisted romances better than anyone, while also being one of the best New Adult writers out there. I can't recommend her stories enough! 
 Trigger Warnings: 
 attempted rape and graphic violence. 
 ""Careful what you wish for, Elle. Sometimes, secrets make things better not worse."" 
 Crown of Lies is a story told over the span of three years. Our main protagonist, Elle, is almost running her father's multi-million dollar department store chain/company. She's happy with her life, even though she throws all of it into work, while never truly having a childhood. 
 On her nineteenth birthday, Elle decides to make a rather reckless, but believable, trip into New York City all by herself after she is finished working that night. She is tired of always having a scheduled and sheltered life, so she decides to take matters into her own hands and chooses to see what it is like out in the real world. And it is fun and games until two men drag her into an alley to rob and rape her. 
 We are then flashed three years into the future, where Elle is very successfully running her father's company, and is still making work her main priority. She has never dated since that frightful night three years ago, but she can't help thinking about the man who saved her and what happened to him. She didn't even get to learn his name. 
 Even though she hasn't stopped thinking about ""Nameless"", her father won't stop trying to hook her up with people, because, after a heart attack that he endured and lived through, he wants to make sure she is happy when he is no longer there. It has worked to no avail, that is until she meets up and coming business man, Penn Everett. You guys aren't stupid; you can see where this is going. 
 I loved Elle, I thought she was a little realistic sweetheart, but Penn was a little too much for me at times. I always go into New Adult guessing that there will be a brooding egomaniac alpha male, but he still was a little over the top for me. Also, I hate the miscommunication trope, and I didn't understand why he would act like he didn't care and dance around the bigger issues at hand. And, let's be real, he was a little stalker-ish to be completely sexy and unproblematic. Plus, there was a few very FSOG influenced elements of this story, too, but don't let that scare you off, because Crown of Lies is only like a million times of a better read. 
 That ending, in true Pepper Winters' fashion, gutted me. Even though she's the Queen of New Adult, she is also the Queen of heart wrenching Cliffhangers. But, thankfully for me, Throne of Truth, the second half to this duology, is already available and on my Kindle just waiting for me to devour. 
 Obviously if this were not an Erotic New Adult Romance, I would for sure talk more about Penn being problematic and his actions, no matter his intentions, were pretty questionable at times. Yet, I knew what I was getting into when I picked this book up, and I'm much more slack on the content for this genre than I am for others. Regardless, I am trying to let you guys know, in case you don't like the controlling, personal space lacking, won't take no for an answer, alpha male protagonists in your Erotic Romances, because that truly is Penn. 
 These problematic elements, plus Penn's pointless vendetta towards Elle, were the only thing that kept me from loving this story completely. It also helped very much that Elle was constantly shown as a strong, powerful, and capable woman. She really was such a surprising character, who I ended up loving. And I loved her sidekick kitty, Sage! 
 I also want to say that Pepper Winters handled the attempted rape and the PTSD afterwards really well. I loved that we saw Elle still struggling with it three years later, and I think there is a really important discussion to be had on what strangers can take from us, even without invading our bodies, but just taking away our power and self-worth.

2,"This books is like holding in the pee: uncomfortable and painful until you let it go. The it's like you've been born again. 
 #NOPE 
 This books just didn't work for me. It was not until the last fifty pages that I felt interested on the story or the characters. I didn't like Quentin, nor Margo. In fact they just sounded like the characters from Looking For Alaska. Cool but problematic chick, the boy is a loser... 
 I was expecting so much from John Green that I feel terribly disappointed by his last books I've read. It seems to me that he simply sticks to the same routine of the same character construction. I think TFIOS was such a hit because it actually deviates from that."
4,"Reviewed at: http://www.teachmentortexts.com/2013/... 
 What a great narrative about facing your fears! Mixed with Jon Klassen's brilliant illustrations, Snicket's story takes us into the mind of a little boy who is afraid of the dark."

4,"""You don't know this, baby. but some men have dream women, too."" 
 Oh Tack. He may be rough around the edges but this line was very sweet. And I really loved Tyra, too. She is just as stubborn as Tack is. Loved the push and pull between these two, with neither of them backing down without a fight."
1,"I'm 40% of the way in, and this is how it is: 
 ""EAT!"" 
 ""My appetite vanishes."" 
 ""Stop biting your lip or I'll boink you!"" 
 ""I gasp. I stop biting my lip."" 
 ""He touches my cheek and I feel it down...there."" 
 ""I bite my lip again."" 
 EVERY. TWO. PAGES. Dear God. Yes, he has a thing about control! And food! And her biting her lip! Must we read about it every two goddamned pages?! Talk about getting hit over the head! 
 Look, I'm not a snob. I read fanfic. I like fanfic! (Hollah at Slimreaper over at fanfiction.net!) I'm fine with smut. We all need smut every now and then. Problematic characters? So Christian's a psychopath (more Patrick Bateman than Bruce Wayne) and Anastasia's the definition of a mewling quim - you know, whatever. And I understand that this book transitioned from Twilight fanfic to the page. 
 But could they not afford an editor? AT ALL? 
 Is it too much too ask for fanfic-transitioned-smut that is clearly written and doesn't commit the most elementary of creative writing mistakes? Such as: Repetitive dialogue (see above), Captain Obvious sentences (""How does he switch so quickly from one mood to the next? He's so mercurial...It's hard to keep up.""), characters asking themselves stupid questions (""Stop all that...You, defying me."" ""Me? Defying him? How?""... 
 I mean, at the very least could they have had someone to come in and check that the Anglicisms don't appear in a story that's supposed to be set in America? Neil Gaiman has to clean up his UK editions when they're published in the US, why aren't the same standards applied to this chick? 
 I'm reviewing this from the very lowest of standards, you know. I'm not even going to think about the lack of plot (seriously, this makes ""Twilight"" look highly conceptual.) But I haven't encountered a book that's tested my patience so much since Lawrence Durrell's Justine. 
 Verdict: If you want to be titillated (and honestly that's the only conceivable reason why you pick this book up), might as well do a search on some fan fiction sites for a few good authors who'll deliver the thrills in a few short chapters and in much better prose. Or Google ""erotica"" and see where that takes you.

 ETA July 10: 
 THAT'S IT. I'm throwing in the towel. Kindle tells me I made it 70% of the way through. I think I need a freaking award for having slogged through that much text. Man, this is coming from someone who made it all the way to the end of Twilight - I try to find something to enjoy in everything I read, but this book just has no redeeming qualities. Boring, vanilla, repetitive sex scenes ad nauseum, a whining psychotic male lead whose ""sexy talk"" is cringeworthy and a seriously addled female lead. I feel personally assaulted by this ""book."""
5,"I love Gail Carson Levine. I love this book. I love everything about this book, and I will never stop loving this book. 
 Actually, Fairest is my favorite of Levine's works. It shines so brightly, I think, partially because of its obscurity. If ever a book begged for a movie adaptation, it was this one-- I need to see this on the big screen. 
 As usual, we get an at once fantastic and believable setting in the kingdom of Ayortha. Aza is a beautiful (on the inside, I suppose) protagonist who made me root for her all the way, with her flaws and her talents both. Ijori was a love interest so original he still makes me sorry to see him go at the end of the book. Even Ivi, the king, and every smaller character was so easy to adore and to be curious about. 
 The songs! What complaint can I make about the songs. I've always loved them, I've always had my own personal tunes for them, and I'm likely to start humming those tunes at any given moment should something remind me of them. (I got my version of ""who judges the judge"" stuck in my head during a discussion in a class about judging what true death is just yesterday.) I hope someday I get to record my tunes for these songs, because they are endlessly entertaining. Even the scenes where people are singing their dialogue, it never felt overdone or confusing. I love this book!! 
 This book is a book for younger teens than I. I should probably be moving on towards other books. But I just can't take this one off my shelf. It's warm and comforting to read, and I think I will still find myself as engrossed in it as I am now several years down the line."
3,"This is a story about a man named Kvothe and get this, this book tells the story of Kvothe's journey, this is not a story about Kvothe and his adventures. 
 What I expected: 
 What we got instead: 
 The story start off with Kvothe being introduce to us as an innkeeper. However, Kvothe is no ordinary man, he's not just simply an innkeeper, he has a past, a past that many people to the present days refer him as a legend. A past full of sorrow, journeys, friendship, struggles, love, and sympathy/magic. I was expecting an adventure of Kvothe's, but instead we get an innkeeper telling the story how he became the Kvothe that is known as a legends. Kvothe tells the story of his youth days and yes, Kvothe is smart, bright, and maybe special? But we don't get to see the things that actually makes him a legend. Patrick Rothfuss starts Kvothe's story from the very beginning - Kvothe as a child. The tale of Kvothe and his parent, being a street beggar, surviving in the street, going to the university, his seek for vengeance, and we get to see his struggles, but no adventures of magic and fighting demons/monsters here. This story is dreadfully long, really slow paced. Things do start to pick up after 600 pages though... yes, 600 pages. The plot almost feel non-existence, because really nothing happens. Kvothe goes to school and deal with you know the usual drama - being a teenager, having crushes on girls, having an arch enemy, and trying to figure out about sympathy/magic, and the Chandrians. It almost gives you a Harry Potter kind of feel with the whole going to school to learn magic and having an arch enemy (Draco Malfoy), but gosh, the plot though! It doesn't exist! After 600+ pages we're still left with many questions that still wasn't answer after reading 600+ pages of this novel. No explanation on the Chadrians, those spidery demons, and what is really going on at all. 
 I will said, I like Kvothe though, the only reason why I continue with this story was because of Kvothe with the plot not existing at all. I like Kvothe because he can be humble at times and he's prideful, but not in an arrogant way. Kvothe respects others and doesn't push anyone unless your his arch enemy. 
 So is this worth a read? If you're willing to be patient then yes. But if you're looking for a fast paced adventure story, this is not it. 
 I am hoping that because we got the jest of Kvothe's back story, The Wise Man's Fear will be better, but it being 994 pages... I'm not so sure if I will ever get to it. Honestly, this was a struggle to finish. 
 Rating: 3.5/5"
4,"3.5 Stars 
 Well that was interesting. Funny. And sexy... in an extremely weird way. T-Bone sure had his own way of thinking about the world. The sex scenes were hot, but were either in weird places or had some weird words thrown in. The epilogue was cute."
4,"A dystopic novel set in what used to be Chicago, the city operates in five so-called 'factions', all named after the character traits they value the most: Abnegation (self-denial); Amity (peacefulness); Candor (honesty); Dauntless (bravery); and Erudite (intellectualism). The inhabitants of the city live separated according to faction membership; at the age of sixteen, each citizen chooses, after a futuristic 'aptitude test' to show them which faction suits them best, where to live. 
 The book's main character and heroine, Beatrice, takes the tests with her order brother, Caleb. Beatrice doesn't feel at home at all in the exaggeratedly selfless Abnegation, whereas Caleb appears to be Abnegation impersonated. After due testning, both sibblings reach unexpected decisions--decisions which will doubtlessly bring dire consequences to themselves, their family, and even their city. 
 I loved 'Divergent' from the first chapter and onward. The novel is well-written and has a rapid pace, rendering the reader breathless and engaged. This, however, is over-worked to a fault: at times, I found the novel confusing, and its premises a tad to complicated. While a Tolkienesque prologue explaining every detail of the nature of the fictional world is (almost always) undesireable, a few more explanatory paragraphs toward the beginning of the novel would have been nice. 
 I like how Roth explores the conflict of a life choice and the ties of family, combined with a struggle of finding oneself in a highly conformistic society. Is it for the best to seperate ourselves according to our values, or is it--at the very contrary--disasterous?"
5,"I LOVE this book. I read it and re-read it constantly. It's embarrassing, but I developed a crush on the main character. ;o) It's a great read for anyone."
4,three words: cute and enlightening
3,"This book has so many great ideas. Bone towers in the skies? Tentacled flying monsters who are invisible--except the inside of their mouths? Crazy society that sings laws and flies in gliders? So. Cool. 
 But wow, the execution is sloppy. This book is kind of a hot mess. The characterization and plot both need work, and the lack of exposition or explanation made this amazing, crazy world confusing and difficult to understand. 
 But hey, great ideas."
4,"This was totes adorbs! I mean, Lots of fun"
3,"This is one of those reads that I feel you need to either be a teenager or be able to directly identify with the main character and her situation in order to truly enjoy it for everything it's worth. Not that there's anything wrong with that, I believe there should be books out there targeted for teenagers who are going through rough times and as a young adult I still enjoy some of those but this one just really wasn't for me. I could go on and on about all the negatives of this book but that would be rather pointless because I didn't hate it, I just didn't find it Great. It was an average read, with a slow plot that never seemed to hit take off and just continued to roll down the runway until the final 50 pages or so when shit actually happened other than Savannah attending school and resisting the urge to give into her lusty feelings towards the perfectly handsome rich boy in her class who only ever spoke to her. Which means he must want to have sex with her, right? Obviously. But she can't get involved with someone like him, because she's just a poor girl who has to spend all her time taking care of her little brother. Could she be anymore negative about herself? It got physically painful at times. I could relate to her feeling she was undeserving of how caring and understanding Cameron was towards her, but when she went on and on about how they were essentially in ""different worlds"" because she was poor and he was rich, it made me want to throw the book out the window. 
 There's so many terrible stereotypes about ""troubled kids"" in this book as well, and as someone who attended a similar school to the one spoken about in the novel for a short period of time due to my own mental health reasons, I can in all honesty say I found it kind of offensive how the author described the school and the students lack of interest in learning, let alone attending class. ALSO, WHY DOES NO ONE EVER DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE KIDS WHO ARE OBVIOUSLY SUFFERING. YOU DON'T LET A DRUG ADDICT ATTEND CLASS OBVIOUSLY HUNG OVER EVERY DAY AND PRETEND YOU DON'T NOTICE. JUST LIKE BRUISES ARE NEVER NOTICED ON SAVVY AT ALL IN THE BOOK UNTIL SHE LITERALLY GETS BEAT SO BADLY SHE HAS TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL?!?! This sends the message that we should ignore that others are suffering because clearly they don't want us to point it out, right? Such a terrible message and not one that we should be sending to teenagers. 
 I said I wasn't going to point out all the negatives of this book and I realize I kind of lied there, but at the same time I didn't, because there's still a bunch more that I'm not even going to bother to mention. This book seems to get such good reviews and that upsets me on some level but I can't say it's a terrible story because it's not. 
 This novel is a wonderful story of a teenage girl who's mother abandoned her, and her drunk father is too busy being an asshole to take care of her and his seven year old son with special needs. Savvy takes on the role of caregiver for her younger brother despite still technically being a child herself. She loves him, he's her whole world, and she'll do anything she can to make sure her little brother is happy, because if he's happy then she's happy. Evan's side of the story is what pushed this book to a three star rating. Watching as Savvy struggled to give her brother the proper care he needed yet never failed to show him love was heart wrenching especially when she's constantly living with the fear that her aunt will take him away from her. Savvy has essentially given up her own life in order to make sure Evan lives as good of a life as he can. The relationship between this brother and sister duo is what makes this book worth reading. 
 That is not to say I didn't like Cameron - I just really didn't care for how Savvy treated Cameron at times or how typical romance novel their scenes were. I loved Cameron's character and watching his more internal struggle intertwine with Savvy's as he begin to clearly care for a girl who didn't want anyone to care about her because she didn't want to pull them into her messed up life as well. Cameron just wants to live freely, to just drive and stop whenever he feels like it in random places. He doesn't want a planned out life or to become an adult who's required to go to college (he already can't stand high school) and then get a boring job that he'll have to live the rest of his life working at. That's what I got from his personality and the few times we heard from Cameron's perspective at least. The one or two times we got a look into why Cameron appeared at the ""School for misfits and trouble makers, especially the ones with anger problems,"" made me want more from him. I feel like I would have enjoyed the book more from his perspective since Savvy's perspective left him rather mysterious, as she would say. 
 I couldn't wait to finish this book, which is never a good sign. But I did in fact finish it and didn't find it painful to pick up when I wanted to read. Not anywhere near a five star book, but I enjoyed reading it nonetheless, flaws and all."
4,"This was the first fantasy story that I have truly loved since Harry Potter. Not that it is comparable in any shape or form, I just never thought I would ever be able to get sucked into a magical world again."
4,"3.5 
 Honestly for the first two-thirds of this book I thought I was going to rate it 3 stars but then that last third spiked it up a notch. Can't say I care much for Feyre or Tamlin, but I could hang out with Lucien or Rhysand all day! Lucien was really all that kept me going in the beginning. I'm interested in seeing where the story goes."
3,"""I've never read a book before where I didn't like any of the characters!"" When I first started reading this book, this is what someone else who had just finished it said in one of my book groups on Facebook. She also said that it was worth it. I totally agree with her! 
 I'll admit that at first it was difficult to get into because of that little issue with not liking any of the characters. And, honestly, for me at least, that didn't change all the way to the end of the book. I really didn't like the characters, but at some point I realized why that was. All of these characters are flawed individuals. Very flawed. They're real. They could be real people, there isn't anyone who is the goody-two-shoes here. Usually, that's the hero or heroine of the book, isn't it? The one who is so good you instantly like them and root for them, and though you sometimes roll your eyes at them or shout at your book to tell them not to do the thing that you know is a big mistake you don't ever find yourself sneering in contempt at them. That isn't the case with any of the characters in this book. Not even the heroines. 
 But, though the start is a bit slow because of how difficult it is to like the main character, once things start happening...it's difficult to put the book down! You begin to care about the characters, even the ones you think you shouldn't, and there are twists and turns along the way that have you unsure who the killer is until just before the main character figures it out herself. There are clues peppered throughout the book until that point when it finally becomes obvious, but they're so small that they're easy to miss. I found that refreshing, because it's been a while since I found a book that so utterly fooled me for so long! 
 The book is told through the eyes of three women who are all connected to each other in different ways. Each of these women, and the people in their lives, are flawed and difficult to like, but despite that you do at some point begin to care about each of them. That point is different for each character, but it comes. 
 There are a few things I noticed that seem to not quite make perfect sense, but they're mostly small things and easily overlooked even by the reader. There also comes a time when two of the women's reactions to one another and their behavior seems off but which is necessary for the scene (and the ones afterward) to work. I feel like the author wrote herself into a bit of a corner with the way she had these characters react to one another and feel toward one another and was never quite able to fix it properly to where that scene doesn't seem weird and uncharacteristic of both women. But, it's also easy to forgive this, as well. When you get there, I think you'll know what I'm talking about. 
 The story also deals heavily with addiction, as well as infidelity, abuse, and gaslighting. 
 This book is a good one, despite its flaws and BECAUSE of the flaws of its characters. I'm glad that I didn't give up on it. It's a thrilling and interesting ride that is definitely worth it. I would definitely recommend this book in a heartbeat."
5,"Let me start by saying, the cover artists did an amazing job finding the right image to represent this book. The cover evokes the exact same feeling you get from reading it. 
 If you ask me, Exit, Pursued by a Bear should go up there with Speak as a classic YA book dealing with sexual assault, both because it's that good and because the juxtaposition would show just how broad a spectrum there is for those situations. The aftermath can vary wildly, and I think these and every book like these are important because they can hold a mirror to so many more teens through their differences. 
 What E.K. Johnston has done is finally, finally give us a novel about a well-adjusted character with a constant support system full of people willing to give her what she needs. Hermione doesn't remember what happened to her, but she knows she's changed by it in some fundamental way and she's not hiding from that. She always did and still does care about everyone else's feelings--is she making them uncomfortable? Should she be thinking about herself less, and them more?--but she learns to demand respect, to make her assault about her and no one else. 
 Hermione's character development alone would be enough to make this novel satisfying, but we also get her friendships with her team, and especially Polly, who may run a little toward the typical tough-best-friend but who is integral in helping Hermione decide how she will let people treat her. We get her supportive family who aren't quite sure how to approach her now, and her quirky therapist (yes, she willingly sees a therapist and for once, she's a teenager who isn't bitter or rude about it). We get her cheerleading team, that deep-down familiar camaraderie and friendship that shaped her into an empathetic, levelheaded leader. I never did sports in school, so all of my knowledge of team dynamics was based on Friday Night Lights; I can't believe I'm saying this, but this book was more effective at making me wish I had been on a team. 
 Not only does Johnston give us positive relationships and a heroine who talks about her feelings, but she also addresses all the things you would want a book about rape to address: rape culture, victim-blaming, unwanted pregnancy, psychological damage, and the idea that a victim stops being her own person and becomes some kind of message for everyone else. I had never really thought about it before, but this book opened my eyes to how many people can and will use someone else's tragedy as a vehicle for their own betterment; I loved Hermione for noticing it, and I loved her more for not being filled with rage about it. 
 Overall there were so many things I loved about this book, but probably the biggest were the friendships--of all different kinds--the keenness and sensitivity with which it addresses the issues, and most of all, the main character. I'm really glad I got to know her."
5,"Dead Witch Walking is about Rachel Morgan, a runner with the Inderland Runner Services. Rachel's job is to apprehending law-breakers throughout Cincinnati. As a witch she is one of the many Inderlanders who revealed themselves after a genetically engineered virus wiped out 50 percent of humanity. Witches, warlocks, vampires, and werewolves have lived beside humans for centuries, hiding their powers. Now they've stopped hiding, and the world will not be the same. 
 Rachel reluctantly teams up with Ivy, Inderland's best runner and a living vampire, while on the run with a contract on her head. To clear her name, Rachel must evade shape-changing assassins, outwit a powerful crimelord, and survive a vicious underground fight-to-the-death. 
 Dead Witch Walking is a fun action packed book that has a side humor. This is a great book for anyone who enjoys vampires or paranormal fantasy."
3,"*ARC via NetGalley and I voluntarily reviewed this* 
 This book started off great for me, introducing a character driven for a better education that'll eventually lead to an easier life. She's got family and friends, responsibilities, and aspirations. 
 Then the story's focus changed, and I felt a little lost, which resulted in my decaying interest. I felt like the ground was pulled from under my feet because just as the MC's introduced to a new world of shifters, the story decides to take another turn and show a smaller piece of the big picture. This split in attention between her changing and the town's oddities was jarring, and if you add in the chapters of details that seemed to drag, I got a book that personally made me fight to finish it. The only things that drove me to the end was a character's secret identity that I guessed at and the town's major secret. 
 I like this story's simple originality with werewolves, and it's been a while since I read anything that reminded me of my favorite Were movie with Marty. Nessa stared off cool, but eventually, with her mind in all directions, I kind of lost her in the chaos. I really enjoyed her mother and the support she gave. The romance aspect was pretty good if you like being teased with it, and the ending certainly made me smile because as a hopeless romantic, there's nothing I like more than a satisfying ending. 
 Overall, this is a good story that drags a little here and there with characters that will leave you guessing."
4,"A wonderful heroine and a brutal story that somehow manages to be uplifting. I was a bit surprised by how much description was in the book, but it's essential to understanding the unforgiving land and the culture."
5,"Loved every aspect of this book. 
 I wasn't sure how I felt about captive in the dark (SoManyEmotions!!!) so i was even surprised i went on to the sequal but I am SO Glad i did! 
 I was caught off gaurd by the beginning and the background story build and at first was kind of annoyed and was tempted to page through, but it was a great aspect that i havent really experienced in other reading. 
 I can't explain what captivated me with this story so much to be honest. I love emotional roller coasters and this definitely hit that spot but there was something more that i can't indentify. 
 The writing and scene descriptions were impeccable, I always look for my favorite aspect; Logic...and was definitely not disappointed. 
 the ending was fantastic and sort of a cluster of up and downs. there is no possible way i could stop at any point, i had to finish and knew how it ended. 
 this was a random read off of rec's but i am so glad i took the time, will definitely remain a favorite."
2,"I really wanted to like this. I did. 
 BUT I found myself at times cringing, rolling my eyes and making that bitchface I've realized I have. 
 Eva our heroine moves to the big apple from San Diego hoping to make a life based on her own merits. See, she comes from a life of wealth, her mother is married to a guy who's loaded. BUT they purchase her a fancy apartment where she takes up residence with her bi roommate Cary. We don't know what kind of trauma Eva has experienced in her life yet, but we do know something has happened as its hinted at. Her mother is over protective and so she is also trying to break free from that and start living an independent life... Sort of. 
 Her new job takes her to the crossfire building where she accidentally meets Gideon cross and things move forward from there. 
 Gideon... I liked him... I think? He's handsome, a billionaire, owns almost all the things in new York and finds Eva completely irresistible. But of course he too has demons in his past (though admittedly we NEVER find out what they are in this book there are only hints as to what they are) 
 I don't even know what to say... I'm struggling not to say that I couldn't help but compare this to a series I disliked but I almost have to because the resemblance is uncanny, is this better written ..yes much better (please see 2.5 stars vs 1) but still everything just seemed so manufactured for me. 
 Neither wants a relationship.. But for each other they will..it was a cycle of he bends his norms and desires to go out with her, he fucks up in some way and she runs off. Rinse repeat. I mean... Over and over. I feel like the book could have saved about 150 pages. but on top of that I like reading about adults because I'm an adult and to me Eva just came across as not. Instead of talking about the issues that arose she immediately takes off... I hate that. 
 So at one point I was all hey yay they worked out the major issues now they can get on with the falling in love and being happy ... But no. 
 Hey.., btw Eva I'm a dominant and you're a submissive.. Bet you didn't know that! That came out of left field for me because at no point in the front half of the book did I get any inkling that that's where the book was going. Don't get me wrong I love bdsm (not personally but you know... To read) 
 Anyway... There were a few other things that got my hackles up, but I'll leave this review be as is. 
 I will say this, the cover is lovely, and I'm a total cover h00r ...(the cover has changed to be more like those damn fifty books because why not ride that train) Half the books on my tbr list are because I was drawn in by the cover. I will also say that I liked bits and pieces of the characters.. Though the over the top possessiveness from gideon and the super jealousy from Eva kinda scare me for them in the future. 
 So... I guess read this book if you liked that one series that shall not be named. Lulz"
3,"So disappointing in so many ways. The story is spread out over twenty years and takes way, way too long getting to the ""present"" (2005). Roberts spends lots of time in key time periods that, sure, are integral to the story, but there is just so very much piled in. I feel like what should have been vignettes were artificially inflated to make them not just chapters, but entire sections of the book. Which mean that the book doesn't really start until it's practically over. 
 The two main characters were good enough, and the sole reason the book maintained its three stars. Bo is simply dreamy with his manly competence and even temper. Reena is less attractive with her hint of broken and career obsession. Her family helps make up for that, though, so it evens out on the plus column. 
 The central conflict, though, the main antagonist, just doesn't work. And that's far more serious. His identity isn't really a mystery (though Roberts avoids naming him for far too long) and his obsession is pretty clear as well. But he's way too competent for what he turns out to be and that makes him way, way too successful for the eventual plot. This affected the ending where I was left with a sense that the cost was too much and artificially inflated at that. This made the ending feel unearned in a way that makes you reevaluate the whole story. Which is where you find that it really doesn't work because not only was the bad guy too competent in the end, but he was more competent than he should have been all the way up front, too. 
 So yeah, I felt fundamentally cheated and manipulated with the main plot and ended up wishing that this had been a straight-forward romance rather than one of Roberts' thrillers. 
 A note about Steamy: Another area I felt robbed as the main characters get essentially one decent intimate scene with two half-hearted sketches later that feel peremptory, at best. This is made worse by dragging us through another scene with Reena and somebody else and I actually kind of hate that."
5,"(Denny translation, but I also read a lot of Marius' part with the original translation on classicreader.com, and then re-read throughout the year with the Signet edition.) 
 It took me a while to read because it is long and at times difficult to get into, but the times that I was into it, I completely fell into it and I fell in love with it. It is wonderfully written, at times truly beautiful and Romantic, Hugo's narration has a tendency to be very detailed and sometimes go off on tangents but when he is focused on something it can be very magical to read. I'm in love with many of the things he says in his book, such as the notes on love that Marius had written for Cosette, and the moving speeches of Enjolras and dialogue of other members of Les Amis de l'ABC, as well as various quotes throughout. 
 As well as the beauty, and the great sadness that often occurs, there are also scenes which are just hilarious and so enjoyable to read, the shenanigans and silliness that happens with the Amis and with the Patron-Minette, etc. 
 I rarely love a group of characters as much as I fell in love with Les Amis. They are truly wonderful. It's impossible for me to put them in order of favourites, but Enjolras is truly a fascinating character, and I have a soft spot for Feuilly. But every character is wonderfully written and while some I would have loved to see even more developed, I do understand that the focus of the story is Jean Valjean and Cosette and Marius, and I am grateful to have so much more about Les Amis than we get in the musical. 
 The story is extremely important and sadly, still relevant. It has a beautiful message; I love how Hugo simply preaches salvation through love, and his hopes for the future are beautiful, though heartbreaking, as the world still is very much in need of change. 
 It is inspirational; it is about life, as it was and is, about redemption and goodness, fighting for the people and the future, about morality and human behaviour with some very interesting uses of character to represent society and how a person's situation in the world affects them and changes them. Above all, it is about love, which may well be the only way to save us."
0,"Not rating with stars, simply because it wouldn't be fair. Not sure whether it was the time I read it, or if I honestly didn't like this book... but, dang it, I really struggled to get through each page. 
 I'll probably give it another try in the future."
3,"Normally I love books by this author and love her writing style but this book ughhh just did not do it for me at all. Character development is always done well but I just didn't care about the main characters at all. I was almost at 4 stars then the storyline got to a point that was so unbelievable or rather like OK, and.... I mean that's it? After everything else , really? The author talks specifically about this topic and that she took a chance because that's where the story went, well I'm totally ok with that but it felt forced. So much time was spent developing early parts of the story there was nowhere else to go. This review sound like I'm frustrated cause I am, I absolutely hate when this happens especially when reading an author you personally and professionally adore. I hope it is just me and others connect to the characters and story more than I did."
4,"In a world parallel to ours, magic exists as do all the fairy tale beings we read about including witches, ogres, vampires, berserkers, shape shifters and more. In this world, the land of Elden is ruled by a witch and a vampire (both good people). They had four children - three sons and a daughter. Then an evil sorcerer came along determined to destroy them all. AS they were dying, the king and queen cast a spell upon their children that took them to safety, but imbued them with the need for vengeance. This is the first book of the series. 
 Nicolai, the eldest of the siblings, was known as 'The Dark Seducer' until the spell cast by his parents took him from his bed and dumped him into the role of sex slave for the vile princesses of the kingdom of Delfina. Through witchcraft, they took away his memories and his ability to escape. His only hope is Jane, a mysterious woman who appears in his cell, unseen to all others but him. Summoning her to this magical realm, he must earn her trust to gain her assistance and then escape the evil clutches of the jealous princess. 
 The story is fast paced, action packed and hot hot hot. The beginning is a little hard to get into, but once you do, it is hard to put down. (view spoiler)[The instant attraction is a bit weird, but when you find out they knew each other previously, it is understandable. (hide spoiler)] Nicolai is over the top sexy with his fierce protectiveness towards Jane. He is the very definition of the alpha male. Jane is a human scientist who has strengths that go deep within. 
 Though I had to suspend disbelief a few times due to the coincidences, I really enjoyed the book. It is pure Showalter, a writer whose books I definitely enjoy. This is the first of a series of four books so there is not a real ""ending"", but it does end in a good enough way that I didn't hate it. I've already read three of the others (out of order), and enjoyed them all, though I will admit the time aspect has had me a little confused at times. If you start with this one, though, a lot of that is explained. 
 Definitely recommended for those who like Showalter, paranormal romance, and steamy hot sex."
5,"Wonderful, bittersweet *sigh* - thus ends Rose's tale. Good ending that wrapped up the major story lines, without being too neat."
4,"I love a YA story with a present family element. I have a hard time with Jenny Han's writing style, but I enjoyed this story. Im not crazy about Chris, and I wish Lara Jean had a tighter group of friends. I thought the premise was unique and interesting."
4,"Alive, the first book in what author Scott Sigler calls The Generations Trilogy, seems at first to be well traveled territory. A young girl, who thinks she is 12 but discovers quickly she looks much older, wakes up from a ""coffin"". She is joined by others her age and all are also waking up and questioning the bleak abandoned facility they appear to be in. Having few memories and knowing nothing about their environment, they wander through seemingly endless corridors looking for answers and struggling to survive. It is somewhat easy to compare their dilemma to other popular young adults books like The Maze Runner, The Hunger Games,and even Lord of the Flies. It is impossible to not think of Lord of the Flies if the writer throws in a segment involving teenagers and wild pigs. So Alive seems to be revisiting old haunts in the YA market and it does just that for a while. But eventually it breaks through and becomes its own creative tale. 
 How it breaks through plot-wise will not be revealed. This is a novel with lots of turns and surprises. It would be wrong to spoil it for the prospective reader. Yet much of how it differentiates itself from the YA pack has to do with the author's style. Scott Sigler has a dark streak. While the violence level is equal to that of The Maze Runner and The Hunger Games, it seems to me darker and more intense. So intense that I would question the book's suitability for preteens. Yet the young adult/teen audience it is geared for is the perfect audience and well suited for the themes and dilemmas that are developed. The author takes his time revealing what is going on even though most readers will probably figure out where the young protagonists are located before they do. What I like is that with every reveal and clue of the plot, we discover something about the characters. ""Em"" is the main character, a young girl whose container she wakes up in is labeled ""M. Savage"". At the beginning, this is her only clue to her identity. She becomes the leader rather reluctantly and each obstacle becomes another hint to her purpose and existence. That also rings true in a minor version for the other teens. In fact their thoughts, behavior and particular markings on them hints of reveals to come in later installments. One of the nice themes going on when I read it is that even though the teens wake up with few rules and in a societal chaos, class and status still seems to haunt them as a irreversible part of the human condition. As for the plot in Alive, it is standalone in the sense we get an adequate explanation to what is going on but, like the good writer he is, Sigler leaves a few mysteries unexplained and an ending that prepares you for more to come. 
 So what Alive gives us is an entertaining dystopic science fiction novel with maybe a little more horror elements than some young readers are used to. Yet the way Sigler merges these elements should please these very readers. He creates an attractive dystopic world and manages to throw in a lot of thrills along with some involving coming-of-age themes. What I look for in a new series is a first book that stands on its own and gives me the satisfaction that I have read a novel rather than a introduction. But I also want it to leave just enough to make me want to see what happens in the next installment. Sigler's Alive does both."
5,My favorite from the Spindle Cove series.
2,"I'm so weary of the pressure on authors to drag stories out into three volumes. So much of this felt like filler as we slowly worked our way to the actual action in the last 20% of the novel. Far too much emphasis on the love story, and the heroine is starting to resemble the awkward, melting girls pictured on the covers of the books, rather than the clever, brilliant strategist we are frequently told she is."
5,"Another brilliant piece of work! 
 Schwab just have a way to drag you in and keep you hooked until the very end! 
 She is definitely on my favourite authors list from now on. So I'm hunting down her other books and hoping and praying for a third instalment in The Archives series. 
 Definitely pick this up!"
3,"Idk, I feel like this really changed my perception of Maxon, and not necessarily in a good way..."
4,I was thrilled when I heard this book was coming out. I was not disappointed. Ms. Moran paints a very vivid picture of revolutionary France. She brought the characters to life and made them real. The only reason I didn't give her 5/5 is because I didn't like her Marie Antoinette. I have always had a soft spot for her and so much respect for the grace and strength she showed during the revolution. I just didn't get that in this book.
4,"A bit gritty and grotesque in some parts but overall a plot that really drew me in. With its flawed but heroic main character, mystery, and strangeness, this book was one of the more unique YA books I've read. I liked that it was suspenseful without being stressful. I'd like to go back and read the sequel to The Eternal Ones which I read and enjoyed a few years ago."
2,"2.5 stars 
 I didn't pick up a book for at least two weeks, so I wanted something that I didn't have to review (thanks, Noelle!), and that I was practically guaranteed to like. 
 Seriously, this is as close to a guarantee as you can get with me. 
 Unfortunately, this was more like Dan Gilbert's guarantee that the Cavs would win a championship before Lebron. 
 The story really picks up in the last quarter of the book but not enough to make me forget some earlier scenes of such unintentional comedy I was actually cringing as I read them. ""You're a mayfly"" feels like this summer's ""You're my heroin."" Some of the earlier dialogue felt Stephenie Meyer-esque -- and not even the Twilight ""I hate myself for reading this but at least it's super readable"" Meyer, but the Host ""I REALLY hate myself for reading this because it's so plodding"" Meyer. 
 ""I didn't save you,"" he whispers, lips tickling my eyelashes. ""You saved me."" 
 He repeats is over and over, until we fall asleep pressed against each other, his voice in my ear, my tears in his mouth. 
 ""You saved me.""Save ME. 
 There were a lot of statements like: 
 ""It isn't about destroying our capability to fight so much as crushing our will to fight."" 
 ""God doesn't call the equipped, son. God equips the called."" 
 ""Cruelty isn't a personality trait. Cruelty is a habit.""They just felt a bit cliche and perfect for the next Roland Emmerich movie. 
 I was actually surprised to find out that the author has a Printz. I'll have to check that series out because I don't think I'll be continuing on with this one. Back to the mental casting room, Henry Cavill."
4,"Ms. Aaron made me believe that a mafia hitman with over 200 kills could and would be sexy and worthy of love. As a heroine, Charlie was terrific blend of vulnerable and fierce. Love the overturning of the damsel-in-distress trope."
5,Love this book. I literally couldn't put it down.
5,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! It not only lived up to my expectation but went past it! It's definitely a must read!

 Final Thoughts 
 I frickin loved this book. I'm only gutted it's going to be another YEAR until the next and final book in this series releases. But then again... I'm in no rush for this series to be over."
3,"Yo. This was actually super fun. 
 And I was not expecting that. At all. 
 Cause honestly, going off the cheesy ass cover, what I was expecting was another disappointment like Timebound, full of angsty boring romance plot tumors and average boring characters. 
 But thankfully that's not what happened! Bree is a fun character. Finn is a fun character. The other supporting characters are appropriately fun and fleshed out and don't fall into clean little boxes. The plot was a bit hard to follow at times, but it was surprisingly well resolved by the end, at least as well resolved as a time travel plot can be. It did take me a while to wrap my head around the world and conflict, simply because we're thrown into it with very little room to adjust, but the characters saved it and kept me interested. 
 Overall, a pretty good time traveling sci-fi romp. Sadly, I'm not really looking forward to the sequel, because romance issues. But I'll give Akins the benefit of the doubt."
4,"This honestly would've been a good prologue to the book. There is a ton of unnecessary infodump which was all explained later in the book (and most of what was mentioned wasn't even explained!). Okay, but not great. 
 Merged review: 
 LOVE. <3 I love Clary, I love Simon, I love the premise, I Two and three? . . . Well, not so much."
4,"Fun and charming. I never thought I'd say this, but a werewolf boyfriend doesn't seem so bad right now."
5,"I just finished this book this morning at breakfast and I'm still in shock. This book should come with a warning that it require coffee or a meeting with a friend to discuss it afterward. 
 Cady spends the summers on a private island with her mother, aunts, cousins and grandparents. They've spent every summer there as long as she can remember. She's especially close with the cousins her age, they call themselves the Liars. 
 Everything is wonderful with the Liars until what Cady calls Summer Fifteen. She's involved in an accident that summer that changes everything, she just can't remember what happened and no one will tell her. Slowly she begins to piece Summer Fifteen together. 
 After seeing E. Lockhart at BEA and hearing other authors talk about her narrator in very vague terms, I realized I needed to finish this book that I'd waffled through for the first 100 pages. On the plane home from BEA, I couldn't put it down. The last 100 pages I wanted to stay up and read all night. Sadly, sleep always won. 
 First read - May 21-June 2, 2013 
 Second read (audiobook) - July 14-23, 2013"
3,It was fine. A perfectly forgettable fluffy installment. I liked reading it. It was enjoyable. I doubt this book will make any impact on anyone's life. It's the book equivalent of an episode of Murder She Wrote.
2,"Technically I DNF-ed this since I didn't finish the last chapter... I've been doing that a lot lately with books it seems.. Oh well. 
 I enjoyed the book, but to me, it just felt too unrealistic. I think if I hadn't been listening to it on audiobook in tandem with reading the ebook, I wouldn't have made it through. Aside from the celebrity backdrop which I can buy into, it felt too insta-lovey and like the relationship was glorified when in reality it wouldn't work at all (at least in my opinion). However, I did really enjoy the strength of the female character. 
 MINOR SPOILERS: He basically was a peeping tom on her when she barely even knew him and she was okay with that after a minor argument?? No. That was a huge invasion of privacy that he pins on ""being southern"" and that she later romanticizes that I just couldn't move past. I get that he's a party boy, but it honestly felt like the reasons he liked her so much didn't go far beyond physical and the fact that she took care of his kid (which was her job...). Another issue that I had which wasn't a huge deal but still irked me, she never mentions her brother except in quick flashback moments?? Where is he? Is he with their parents? Did I miss something? Did something happen to him? Maybe it's because I'm close with my brother but I just don't understand how he pretty much totally disappears out of her life. I get her parents being distant, but where's her sibling that she grew up with??"
4,"The reason I read this book was because of the show. I tried watching it, didn't know any of the characters, so I decided I was going to read it before trying to watch it again. 
 First off, this book is amazing. The characters are all great, the switching off from character to character each chapter really worked well, and the length wasn't too bad to get through if you just got into it. The first hundred pages were hard to get through since I was still learning names, but it really got going once I got it all down. 
 I'm impressed with how he kept everything straight and didn't make it seem too much with a book of that length as well. Martin did a very good job with that and I'm really hoping he does the same with the others as well in this series. 
 I cannot wait to read the next book in the series from that cliffhanger."
4,"The Fever series is by far one of my favorite ones I have ever read. In fact, this is the third time I have read the first book and I still enjoy it. Granted I can take it at a more relaxed pace since I know what s going to happen but it is still good. It's like getting reacquainted with your old friends! Plus Barrons is just..... delightful. He is by far the most alluring bad boy I have ever come across! 
 Anyways, lets get to the meat of the story, shall we? It's about a pretty 22 year old woman named MacKayla Lane. She is all sunshine and daisies, er magnolias if you will. Then one day while chilling at the pool side she gets a call that changes her life. Her beloved sister is dead, murdered 4,000 miles away from home on the Emerald Isle. 
 The Irish police try to help the Lane family but they don't have any leads on who could have done it and the case goes cold. Mac isn't satisfied with this and against her parents wishes, she goes to isle and decides to be a persistent thorn in the investigator's side until something is done! She wants justice! However when she gets there things rapidly turn to shit. 
 Poor Mac witnesses a most terrible happening in a pub shortly after her arrival. Something freakishly nasty is feasting on the life force of a woman, draining her of her beauty. Mac thinks she is going crazy, and to make things worse she gets struck by a rather nasty old woman that tells her if she can't respect her bloodline then she should just go die elsewhere. 
 Sadly, things keep going downhill until our Heroine literally stumbles upon a book store named 'Barrons, Books, and Baubles'. It is at this point when the tale really starts to take off and become interesting for not only do we start to get more insight into what happened to Alina, Mac's sisters, but we also get introduced to a most secretive man, Jericho Barrons. 
 Through very strange means and perhaps fate, Mac and Barrons start working together to recover a very evil fae book called the Sinsar Dubh(She-sa-do). Mac really has no interest in such a vile creation and just wants to find out who her sister's killer is so she can take him down and then go back home to Ashford Georgia. She is not meant for doom and gloom which seem to now be pervading her every step. She just wants to find justice for her family and then return home and go back to being a bartender! 
 Destiny seems to have other things in mind because her role in the upcoming battle between human and fae is just beginning. There is no turning back now, poor Mac is in deep and must still go deeper for vengeance. Things will never be the same. She is losing her rainbow and has no one to keep her a float but the sinfully sexual Barrons."
3,"Forced happy end, full of tropes and hopes. I liked it exactly for that. Something that is soooo deep ingrained to modern society it's been read without being read. 
 Jane is the prototype of all the heroines, the Hermiones, the Bellas. It shows what a 19th century girl dreamt of and those dreams are not so far away from 21st century."
4,"Cathy, Chris and Carrie escaped from the attic after the death of Cory, poor Cory :( They realized a horrifying truth at the end of Flowers In the Attic; they were being given rat poison on their powdered doughnuts. Now they struggle with the internal debate: do they go to the police and tell the world what happened to them, or do they run far away and try to forget the horrors of their past? Cathy and Chris want to have a fresh start. They get on a bus hoping to head far away, but Carrie is very ill from the poison and they are kicked off the bus. Luckily, there is a compassionate woman on the bus who gives them an address of a doctor that she works for and tells the children to go there. 
 Thus begins a new era in their lives. The doctor is kind and takes them in. They live in a large house in a nice neighbourhood, and for the first time and almost three and a half years, they are free. They can go outside, they can run and play, they don't have to fear the grandmother's harsh punishments and rules. 
 Cathy is well on her way to living her dream of being a ballerina, and Chris plans to finish his education and go to med school. Carrie is treated for the poison, but years without sunlight and nutrients have stunted her growth, and she is doomed to live underdeveloped. 
 But the time in the attic changed the Dollanganger children. They are not innocent as they once were. An eerie, sexual tension underlies the relationship between Cathy and Chris, and Cathy is filled with hatred and thoughts of revenge towards her mother. She has grown to be a very beautiful young girl, just like Corrine, and, similarly to Corrine, she knows exactly how to use her beauty to manipulate men. She twirls them around her little finger and leaves them hoplessly in love with her, sometimes not even realizing what she's doing to them. 
 This story is sick and provocative. It's enthralling. It's creepy. I couldn't put it down. I can't stop thinking about it. It was all that it was promised to be, and while there might be a little room for improvement, it was a really good book. I've told all of my friends that they absolutley must read this series :)"
4,"This was a brute of a novel, I have recently finished the first novel and so was excited to crack into the next one.I have the same feelings as I had for the first novel. The Plot is even more ridiculous, even more, maybe-dambo political. 
 As a British person I felt it was all a ""Little Team America "" sometimes... 
 The things that are thrown into the mix are bloody mental (view spoiler)[Leslies return, new political parties. Clones, content terrorist attacks, even gayer for you possible presidents (hide spoiler)] but I LOVED IT. 
 I felt Ethan and Jack were subjected to his the WHOLE novel, They seemed HFN but theres lots of clinghangers: 
 Also, claps to the introduction of new side characters, Adam and Fis were fab.I am looking forward to the rest of the series!"
3,"I am far too old to be in the target audience for this series, so the moral quandary that made up the bulk of this book mostly just frustrated me. It's a bit like a family sitcom where the kids are smarter than the adults. Certainly one could argue that the adults have become calcified in their ways of thinking and that in these new situations, new (young) points of view are necessary to adapt and survive. 
 (view spoiler)[I'm still not certain what The Weapon was, or what the leaders thought they would gain by using it on a mixed crowd of people, but I liked that it set the fire that allowed both Doon and Lina to be the heroes. I kept thinking, the way that the author kept describing the weather, that a tornado was going to appear and flatten the town, requiring everyone to work together to survive. The fire was the better choice, because it made the leaders culpable, it remained a manageable sort of disaster, and no one lost a trailer. (hide spoiler)] 
 I would definitely recommend this series to kids -- it is gentle post-apocalyptic fiction, with a little bit of danger; and puzzling out the historical artifacts from our own times is a little bonus."
5,"Simply breathtaking!! I spent the entire book alternately crying and laughing, goofy smile on my face, tears in my eyes, sighing, giggling, savouring. The Sky Is Everywhere is exquisitely written; it's a book of contrasts exploring love and grief with raw honesty and lyrical beauty, despair and darkness, joy and sunshine, humour, passion, poignancy, I couldn't read it fast enough, I didn't want it to end. It's the first time a book has ever made me wish that I could write, wish that I could so eloquently express on paper exactly how I feel about the 'losses' in my life and how they've shaped who I am. 
 When I'm with him 
 there is someone with me 
 in my house of grief, 
 someone who knows the architecture as I do, 
 who can walk with me, 
 from room to sorrowful room, 
 making the whole rambling structure 
 of wind and emptiness 
 not quite as scary, as lonely 
 as it was before. 
 All the future we will not have rips and retches out of me into the garbage pail I am crouched over, until there's nothing left inside, nothing but me in this ghastly orange room. And that's when it hits ... 
 Without the harbor and mayhem of Toby's arms and the sublime distraction of Joe's, there's only me. Me, like a small seashell with the lonliness of the whole ocean roaring invisibly within. 
 This is no ordinary YA book, it's an 'ageless' read, that resonated deeply for me. I won't rehash what the story's about, (you can read the synopsis for that) I have too much to rave about as it is. I fell totally in love with all the characters. Lennie, her eccentric Gram with the aphrodisiacal roses, pot-smoking Uncle Big, her sister's boyfriend Toby and of course sweet Joe. In Lennie I recognised a kindred spirit as I'm sure many who have experienced life changing loss would identify. The sex-crazed side of things added a whole other dimension of confusion and guilt for Lennie but I confess it brought me lots of laughs. 
 ""I thought maybe we could hang out,"" he says. 
 This is what I hear in my mind: boner, boner, erection, hard-on, woody, boner, boner, boner. 
 The Sky Is Everywhere is a beautiful five star read, a favourite for 2010 and one I know I'll re-read again and again, (something I rarely do.) It has earned a place on my bookshelf and captured a special place in my heart. Have I conveyed how much I loved this book? I truly hope so.

 This review was originally posted to Jen in Bookland 
 Where the Road Takes Me was a good read, but I was a bit let down by the end. It was alright until that point, but I don't know. Something about the ending just didn't do it for me. 
 *Note: There will likely be some spoiler ahead!! If you don't want to know how this ends please don't read on!!* 
 So Chloe has a plan. She is going to stay away from everyone, not get attached to anyone, definitely not fall in love, then once she graduates high school she will leave. She will just roam around wherever the road takes her and never have any real relationships with people. She can't. She knows what it is like to lose someone and she won't do that to anyone. 
 Blake has his own problems. He is the star basketball player, popular guy, but while his life might look perfect to those on the outside it is anything but. When he comes across Chloe late one night things change. He is intrigued by her. He wants to get to know her. He wonders how he could have ever not noticed her before wandering the halls at school, but he is so sweet. He knows she wants to stay invisible so even though it kills him he pretends to not notice her. He doesn't talk to her at school. He doesn't draw attention to her. He is always trying to do what she wants, what she says will make her happy. Oh he was a sweetheart. 
 So Chloe keeping herself closed off from others is what she claims to want. She lost her mom and her aunt and now lives with a great couple who fosters her and some other kids. She...she could be frustrating. When it was revealed why she was keeping everyone away, why she didn't want to get close to anyone or think of a future, I must admit I was a little disappointed. Like this is all? You have a 50/50 chance of having something bad so you are just not going to live your life? Okay...I get that she is young and scared, but I guess I just wanted more. And she was alright. Really the author did a pretty good job of not making me want to yell at her every two seconds. But still. I...I know she was trying to not let anyone in, but she is so close with her foster siblings and her foster parents that I don't know how she can't see that leaving them without looking back would hurt them greatly. How that is almost like what she is afraid of. That that would be similar to what she doesn't want to happen for them. It would be like they lost her so...I just didn't understand how she could think they didn't love her. How she thought no one did so she would be okay just disappearing. I didn't really understand how she could keep her head in the sand even when they pointed it out to her. When one of the younger kids got angry that she was leaving him and such - how did she not see that this is hurting him? I don't know. I still liked her though which is really props to the author. With someone else this book would have been very tedious to read instead of an enjoyable read. 
 So of course Blake and Chloe get closer despite her trying to stay away. And things progress, she acts out when things get too serious, and Blake is just amazing with her. Oh I loved him. But then the ending. Is is horrible to say that I think it would have been a much better book if a) she didn't really have the cancer gene or b) she died at the end? When she did get cancer I was all ready for her to die. It seemed like that would have made for a better story. Like she learned that living is better than hiding away doing nothing. Instead it felt too...contrived. It was just like oh, okay, this is what we are doing now? Great...It just didn't work for me. I know it might sound odd to those who loved this story, but I do think it would have been a better story. Oh well. It was a good read, entertaining enough."
4,"And Only to Deceive is the first book in the Lady Emily series. Emily is ""newly"" widowed (newly being her husband has been dead for a little over a year, yet she's still in mourning by society's standards). She wasn't married very long to her husband before his death and when he died she didn't feel a very strong emotional upheaval. But upon hearing varying stories about her husband through his many acquaintances she beings to become more interesteD in his life. 
 As Emily begins to learn more about her husband she discovers there was more about him than she was aware. She discovers that he was very much involved in the world of art. As she's going through his things she finds some notes warning her about delving too far into her husband's past warning of danger. Obviously instead of deterring Emily this just intrigues her ever more. She soon find herself caught up in a forgery ring for for works of art from the Greek period. So who can Emily trust amongst her late husband's closest friends? Everyone seems to have something to hide. 
 I think the fact of Emily sort of stubling on to the mystery was really written well. She didn't go looking for anything amiss, it just kind of presented itself to her and she followed the path that it led. 
 I liked Emily's character a lot. She's a woman in the victorian age who has this opportunity to be independent and she really takes it and grows. I like that we get to see the difference between society at the time and the emergence of women trying to become more equal. I liked that Alexander wrote many of the side characters as being understanding to Emily's feelings of wanting independence and not shunning her because of it. Obviously not everyone agrees that women can drink port after dinner with the men and smoke cigars, but it was interesting to see her dive in and be supported. 
 The mystery was really well written. There were a lot of twists and turns and I'll admit sometimes I really didn't know where the mystery was going. But I was interested the whole time in fiding out how everything played out. There were many times that I questioned who to trust convinced that everyone was somehow in on it. 
 The book definitely left me wanting to know what happens next for the characters. I can't wait to start reading A Poisoned Season. Until Then!"
3,"I enjoyed this a lot until the last 20% or so, and then both heroes went a little TSTL."
3,"I'm not always the biggest fan of post-apocryphal storylines, but I needed a book to read during lunch. I tend to read YA or elementary fiction at work to avoid the deeply depressing nature of most of the adult fiction that I read. No use getting inexplicably sad in the middle of dealing with the public! This was close to the reference desk, I knew there was a movie version of it, so I decided to go for it. 
 I found the book to be immediately engaging. DuPrau does a great job of creating a strange otherworld. Everything is familiar, but not quite right. Adults know nothing about lamps, candles, bugs, trees. All of the idioms don't make sense, but no one questions. The time isn't accurate, overhead floodlights provide the only illumination, and students pick their occupations at the age of 12. And of course, there's a plucky heroine and her brave sidekick. 
 You can see the resolution from miles away, but the City of Ember is still engrossing. It was a quick read, and good enough that I actually care about finishing the rest of the books in the series, a rarity in this kind of science fiction."
3,"3.5 stars 
 Lady Madeline Matthews desperately wants to get out of the marriage her parents have arranged for her. While away at school she sees an ad featuring the notorious actor/rake Logan Scott. Hatching a plan for him to steal her innocence so that her suitor will no longer want her, Madeline travels to London to work at the Capital Theater. When she meets Logan Scott though, she find out he might be more than she was bargaining for. 
 I liked Logan Scott a great deal better in the first book. I understand that he thought no one could love him and just strove to push everyone away but I just did not connect with his character. I couldn't look past his treatment of Madeline in the second half of the book. Madeline I did like, she was strong willed and new what she wanted. She just jumped into everything head first and wore her heart out on her sleeve. I don't think I could ever allow myself to be that vulnerable but that quality was endearing."
4,I've enjoyed a few of Jo-Jo Moyes books now. I guess this is not an outstanding read and the story is fairly predictable. However the writing is good and the characters are very well crafted. An easy read but none the worse for that.

4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 I liked this book, i really did. But honestly can you seriously fall in love with a man who is responsible for the death of your parents, not to mention mass murder, or the fact that you have CANCER because of him? I think not. 
 I certainly couldn't. 
 Seriously that's just bloody ridiculous. And personally if someone's good looking AND they're an asshole they don't appear that attractive to me. Just me? Idk. 
 Also, i can't believe her people sold her out to be married, especially to the King?! I imagine if i were in her position i wouldn't be so gracious about it. There were parts of Serenity's character that i really liked but the thing with the King is just ugh. AND HE'S LIKE OVER 60, or something. 
 The plus side was that the book was a good read, and I was glad her dad did the right thing in the end. Can't imagine letting my child be used essentially as a prostitute to get what I want, even if it was world peace :D 
 Even though I've had a little rant about this book, and there is definitely more bad than good in this review i will probably be reading the next book. Don't let me put you off :)"
3,"I had to get used to the style of writing in the book - I found it a little choppy and the way she exclaimed things three times seemed a little off. I suppose in the 1960s/1970s middle/upper class America, that just could have been the way that people wrote. 
 It's graphic for something written just about 40 years ago. It was mostly my curiosity that kept me reading (I finished the book in a day). Now that I see it isn't a true story and a complete work of fiction, it has sort of changed my opinion. I read it thinking it was a true story and wanted to read up on it more."
5,"The Mortal Instruments are an enjoyable series - by and large guilty pleasures. But here's the thing about Clockwork Angel: it's not a guilty pleasure, it's actually a really good book! 
 Cassie Clare created a whole new set of characters, and these characters are fantastic. Tessa is one of the best protagonists I've read about in a long time. Both boys - Will and Jem - are quite compelling. I have to say, my heart went out to Charlotte in this book - she tries so hard, and never seems to get any appreciation out of it. Cassie has fleshed out even the background characters like Sophie and Thomas - most of the characters are somewhat sympathetic, and all of them are 3-dimensional. 
 Clare does a great job writing actions scenes, as well as setting the mood with exquisitely detailed descriptions. But my favorite scenes are the ones with the gang hanging out in the Institute and snarking at each other. And I give epic props to Clare for the twist - I did not see it coming! And upon my two rereads, I appreciate even further how brilliant all her misdirection is. The book holds up very well upon rereading, and I have to say I love this prequel series far more than the Mortal Instruments."
4,"What with all the hate on this book about being a Harry Potter copy. Why is it okay to have a thousand stories about vampires, but the minute you put students in a school of magic, it's a HP ripoff? If I wanted to create a believable system of magic, I would surely want their to be a place or system where young magic users are trained to use magic responsibly. Trust me, I have kids and they would wreak all levels of mayhem if they had magic and no training. Yes, there are similarities to HP, and yet ... there are enough difference for this story to stand on it's on. 
 The characters are magic users called mages. Their magic is very elemental and controlled by will. There are no fancy magical incantations here. The kids go to a school of magic called the Magisterium, where they are trained in an apprenticeship system. 
 The main protagonist, Callum (Call) Hunt, is an outcast with a physical disability and an eccentric father. The small family is shadowed by the death of his mother in a magical war. He has been brought up to believe that magic and mages are bad. Confusion mounts as he enters the magic world and all his beliefs, about the world and himself, are challenged. He is at times sympathetic, but has a brash recklessness that can make him unlikeable. His character is cloaked in uncertainty. Will he ultimately be hero or villain? 
 This world is woven layers of secrets and lies, where answers only lead to more questions. In the end I really enjoyed it and am invested enough to want to know what happens next."
4,"Loved this one, even if I felt like it didn't reach it's full potential. The webchats with Scarlett and her friends were great and the author has definitely written some fanfic of her own ;) I really liked all the pop culture references (and the fact that she was in NJ!)"
1,"My copy was provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. Some things may be changed in the final version. 
 Defy is Sara B. Larson's debut YA novel and my first eARC from NetGalley. I was a little wary of picking up this title based on the emphasized romance in the synopsis, but I took a chance. I think I can best sum this up as Mulan meets Twilight. Alex is masquerading as a boy in the army/Prince's Guard and there's a magical background and a love triangle. Had the story focused in on the Mulan elements, I think I would have liked it. Unfortunately, it was almost all romance and love triangle. 
 What I liked: 
 I was interested in some of the supporting characters, namely the other members of the Prince's guard; they seemed like fun guys with a lot to bring to the table, and I would have liked to learn more about them. 
 I'm still confused about this fantasy world (South America-inspired? South Asia? India?), but I liked the general idea of two warring nations with an imperial catalyst and magical soldiers in the middle of a jungle. Again, though, I wish there were more. The lack of world building made it difficult to invest myself in the world's politics and wars. It wasn't fleshed out enough. 
 Marcel, Alex's twin brother, and Rylan, a member of the Prince's Guard and Alex's friend. I don't know whether Marcel was a ""genius,' but he seemed to be a good big brother and I'm a sucker for those characters. Rylan was a genuinely good-hearted guy, loyal and understanding. He would have been great except for a certain piece of dialogue near the end that resulted in my taking away his Man Card. 
 What I didn't like: 
 Alex/Alexa: She is supposed to be an unbeatable fighter who has been in the army and passed for a boy for years. Her narration and actions made this premise completely unrealistic for me. There was no way she had not been exposed as a girl after three years in the army/Prince's guard unless her brother was both Einstein and Houdini. 
 Perspective: Alex's narration sounded like a hormone-crazed, lovesick teenager. I think the story would have been more enjoyable in third person point-of-view or from a different character's perspective. 
 Telling v. Showing: The majority of the first-person narration centered on Alex telling us stuff, often romance related. There were few fully described, played out scenes; and the scenes we did get often centered on her romantic interactions with the love interest(s) instead of the war, kidnapping, etc. 
 The Romance: I don't like love triangles, and in this case, there was nothing to be angsty about once Alex made a choice ... which she did. But then she kept whining and agonizing over it. It got old fast, especially when there were matters of life, death and country at hand. 
 I was pretty disappointed with this one. The story had some interesting ideas, but they were never fleshed out and took backseat to romance. In the middle of a war and being kidnapped. Alex was supposed to be a butt kicking soldier, but all she thought or talked about was the love triangle. She was the poster child for women who over-think relationships and, on several occasions, a damsel in distress. Apparently there's a sequel in the works, and I hope it does more world building and explains more about the magic system."
4,"I read this book as a young child after taking the dutch version home from the library, and I loved it. I later wanted to reread it, but was never able to find it again, having forgotten the title and who wrote it and most of the plot. So when I stumbled across it again on Goodreads, I was really happy and really eager to read it again. 
 I sort of expected everything to come back to me once I read it, but it didn't really. The most important things I had already remembered or vaguely remembered, but there were large parts of the book that I had forgotten over the years. It made it all the more enjoyable as I got to experience it all over again. 
 (view spoiler)[ The things I did remember were some of the larger plot points, I remembered the sister got swapped out by someone from a different world and that there was something going on with Cat's magic that Gwendolen was using. As I read the book, the nine lives and matches thing came back to me before it was really revealed as well. Despite remembering all these big plot points, I did really still like the book. (hide spoiler)] 
 It's a very charming, quick read that doesn't need a lot of action to be interesting. It stood out to me that the only real action(ish) scene was near the end, but it was never boring before that. I also liked how this is a book geared at children, but it didn't sugarcoat some terrible things. I always enjoy that in literature aimed at young people. 
 I think I haven't read any of the others in this series, so I'm excited to pick them up. I love stuff with multiple worlds in it, so I am confident that I will enjoy them."
3,I'm too lazy for this. I liked it. I would have liked it more if the mythology aspect was better developed but still it was okay.
5,"This mini review was originally published at The Reading Fever 
 I totally lucked out this week, and happened to read two fantastic books in a row! It isn't often that I find two books in the same week that go straight to my favorites list. And, boy, is Matched going on that list! My only regret is that I didn't make more of an effort to finish it before the Breathless Reads tour, so that I could squeal my excitement about the book to Ally Condie, in person. It was such a missed opportunity. 
 I read the first chapter before the tour, and then set it down until last night; not because I didn't like it, but because I have been crazy busy, and then THE French Kiss came along (you know which one I'm talking about, don't you?), and I didn't think Matched would stand up next to Anna's fame. 
 But it did. It really did. 
 I think what I really liked about Matched, is that it had depth. The further I got into the story, the more I realized that something important was happening, and that I got to witness it. This story has a message, and it gets more complex as it moves along. It is first shown with the rebellious words of a poem: do not go gentle. 
 We are shown a society that is very controlled, that has studied and knows how to control every element of its population so well, that it can predict the outcome of almost every situation, even down to the specific actions people will take under different circumstances. But even when you think you have all the numbers down, people can still surprise you. And the society does not like surprises. 
 All this is wrapped in the packaging of a sweet love story, one that is forbidden. One that will have you confused and intrigued, and just dying to see how they end up together, because there is no way that they possibly can; not under the Society's watchful eye. 
 And that's another thing that I really liked about Matched: the relationships. From Cassia's (the protagonist) relationship with her grandfather and parents, to her relationships with her younger brother and best friends, I could feel how important they each were to her as she interacted with them. She cared about them, and they cared about her. There was an importance to these relationships, even if they weren't perfect. It was so refreshing to see. There were also some surprising twists in Matched, that made me humble as a reader; made me remember that I cannot always predict what is going to happen. I loved that. 
 Suffice it to say, that I have become emotionally involved with this book. Yep, I'm in it 'till the end. The poem has become a favorite, the book has become a favorite, and when the next book comes, you can be sure that I will not go gentle. Look it up."
4,"The first thing that piqued my interest in this book was the cover. I mean how gorgeous is it?! The second thing was the summary. Angels and demons working together? I had to find out how this was going to play out. 
 This was a really unique book which provided a refreshing change from the other angel/demon books that I have read. It tells the story of Samantha, a seemingly normal teen, who after a kiss from her crush, begins to change in ways that she never thought possible. Two angels and two demons are sent to earth to get rid of the grays, soulless creatures who rob the souls of humans by kissing them and thus turning them into grays. Now you know that if angels and demons have to work together that things must be REALLY bad! 
 I really liked Sam. Although she wasn't perfect and she made some silly mistakes I thought she was a very strong character with a kind heart. She was dealt some heavy blows but she managed to stay on her feet and keep fighting. Bishop I loved. He was the perfect love interest; dark and brooding with a mysterious past, leaving you wanting more of him. He also had a vulnerable side which made him seem more, for lack of a better word, human. Kraven I also loved. I have a soft spot for the sarcastic and snarky character in books and Kraven was all that and more. Even though he irritated everyone to no end I found it impossible not to like him. I can't wait to see more of him in book two. We didn't really get to learn much about the other angel and demon but they did bring their own qualities to the group. 
 The story itself was filled with so many twists and turns you didn't know what was going to happen next. You were left guessing who was on who's side as the lines between good and evil were constantly blurred. I hate knowing from very early on what way a book will end so I loved how I didn't know what was going to happen in this. The love story was also very well played out. Even though Sam and Bishop only knew each other for a week, it didn't feel that rushed (which is saying something because I hate insta-love stories). Although there wasn't a love triangle I sense something happening in book two which I am curious about (even though I normally hate love triangles). 
 Overall, a fantastically dark and addictive read with a wonderful cast of characters, a steamy romance and a great new take on the angel/demon lore. A must for all paranormal lovers. 
 I was provided with a copy of this book from the publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."
3,"3.5 stars. For a book written in 1956, this is surprisingly modern feeling. The dialogue and some of the views on society definitely have an older feel, but the actual storyline could have been written today. The main character is a nasty guy, but somehow you end up rooting for him in the end. I felt like the story moved along nicely but then got a bit preachy right at the end. I guess a book is allowed to have some sort of meaningful point, but I preferred the action to the moral."
3,"SHE: is a tough but vulnerable search and rescue dog trainer! Who once escaped from a serial killer! 
 HE: is an artistic but grumpy furniture maker! Who is just trying to get some work done! 
 WILL THEY: be able to catch the new serial killer? and define their relationship? and have sex on a table? 
 YES OF COURSE THEY WILL."
5,"What a wonderful story. I started this at midnight, thinking I'd just read a chapter or two. But this story was UN-PUT-DOWNABLE. I couldn't read the pages fast enough and finished the story in one big marathon. 
 Asa's world is fascinating and so different. Their unique technology and worlds are quick to understand and complex but well explained. Eagle was easy to love and so were Wren and Emmie. Even the politics were interesting and complemented the story 
 I completely fell in love with this one.I hope beyond all hope we get another book or two."
5,"Oh my god. I loved this book so much. 
 ----------- 
 ""I was on a train in my own country, in a year the devil designed. 1918."" When I read this sentence--at the end of the first chapter of In the Shadow of Blackbirds by Cat Winters--I didn't think much of it. The novel had a strong start, but I couldn't foresee what a rollercoaster ride it was going to be. Fear not! It's the good kind of rollercoaster ride. The kind that has your stomach leaping toward your mouth every few moments and you, by the end, nearly hysterical with happiness that you didn't die, because, let's be honest... it almost happened. And you loved it. (That got really off topic, didn't it? Sorry.) 
 Obviously there's no real threat of death in reading a book, but at times I thought my heart was going to beat out of my chest. In the Shadow of Blackbirds radiates strength. The story is strong, the characters are strong, even the title of the book is strong, though you'll never realize it until you read the book. *wink wink 
 In the Shadow of Blackbirds takes place in 1918, during World War I and the breakout of the Spanish influenza. I was so impressed with how difficult it was to forget the sickness while reading this book. Like someone living in fear of the influenza, the reader is always aware of its presence. It is there breathing down your neck at all times, waiting. It was extremely easy to sympathize and/or empathize with the characters in the novel. I actually forgot a few times that there was no sickness in my present life and pulled away when my family breathed too close to me. I love it when I get so immersed in a book like that, and it happened extremely easily with this one. 
 As if a pandemic isn't enough, many people died in the First World War as well, so there was a lot of ghost talk in real life and throughout In the Shadow of Blackbirds. Cat Winters' writing was effortless to read at all times. It was so apparent how much time she put into researching the time period, the sickness, the war, et cetera. I didn't feel the need to fact check because nothing seemed out of place to me. I was able to put my full trust into Winters' work, which made the reading process easier. To be honest, I needed that, because the content of the story is a bit... tough to swallow. 
 Mary Shelley, the main character, went through some pretty horrific experiences throughout the time of the book. I loved Mary so much. She is, to me, the perfect ""strong"" character. She wasn't always the dictionary definition of ""strong"", but she kept trucking on and that's what stood out to me. Given the situation she was in she had the perfect amount of confusion/hesitation and certainty. I think I could read about Mary Shelley forever. 
 As you can see, I adored In the Shadow of Blackbirds. I found it on Goodreads sort of by accident and thought it sounded interesting. I never thought I would love it so much. In fact, I think it might be up there in ""favorites"" territory (even though I don't really do ""favorites""). I definitely recommend it to anyone. It's creepy and weird and wonderful and sad. It's so good and I hope everyone else loves it too."
2,"Expected more from this from the hype I've seen on the reviews. I tried to like it, and I did for a little while, and then the ending ugh. 
 It felt too long and dragging for me. Also, authors should really do something about their running heroines to make them more interesting and less annoying."
2,"I just, I read it whole but I was delirious from the lack of sleep. 
 The dialogue, the plot, the characters - the cheesiness of it all is too much for me to handle. And it make me sad to rate this book this low because I did read some great Penelope Ward's books before."
4,"Okay so I'm about a little over half way or so through this book & have some big issues with Ethan. Why didn't he open up and tell Rachel that there was issues prior to her leaving and they could work through all the issues at once and not let her memories bring those issues back which just scares her even more because they are broken memories? Why doesn't/didn't he talk to his family about those prior issues so that he has support? I have a feeling that there is more to her and Garret (I listen to the audio books so not real sure about the spelling of some of the characters) or at least I think that is what Ethan thinks. Why doesn't he tell her he loves her, he hasn't yet and that drives me crazy, he wants to make amends so start making amends & let her know how you feel. One thing I hope is that there isn't this all is forgiven HEA but I don't want to see them split either. Okay enough for now & on to the rest of the book. 
 So continuation of the above, I have finished the book, I give it a 4.5 based on the above. He should have been up front with her & told her what happened and not let her remember the way she did & it break her heart all over again. I'm glad that they didn't just forgive & forget but were willing to work on their marriage & give it a go."
4,I'll post a real review once I finish the series.

 ""The easiest way to steal something,"" **** murmured, ""is for it to be given willingly."" 
 Disclaimer: Alice in Wonderland is not one of my favorite stories for retellings. It is such a unique story full of ridiculous characters and nonsense. So try to make sense of the nonsensical seems silly. Yet Meyer tries. 
 I never connected with Catherine. She had all this ambition to open the best bakery in all of Wonderland but she had no backbone to try to get it. If she had, the whole plot would have been pointless because she never would have ended up in these situations and she wouldn't have caused the trouble she did. She would have been happy, living the life she always wanted. 
 Instead, she got distracted. She let herself fall instantly in love (barf) with the court jester, while being courted by the ridiculous king. Her dreams of opening her bakery still lived in her heart, but she let love rule all. Since the plot then revolved on romance, I excepted more from Meyer. I friggin loved Cress and Carswell. Scarlet and Wolf were adorable too. These relationships had chemistry. In comparison, Catherine has no chemistry with either one in her love triangle. That whole portion of the plot felt... bland. 
 I probably went into this novel with unrealistic expectations since I have been waiting impatiently for this novel since I finished Winter this time last year. As a stand alone it wasn't bad. Some of the rhymes are cute. I just wish we'd had more character development and a stronger female character who carried herself."
3,"I enjoyed this more than the last Dark Hunter book. This one starts off pretty good with Were-Hunter Ravyn captured in cat form and brought to the animal shelter to die when he changes form. Luckily, reporter, Susan, is conned into adopting him to help her best friend, even though she is allergic to cats. And there starts the adventure."
5,"Excitement, action, tension of every kind, and intense emotion and heat? Yes please...and thank you! I loved Single Malt-it reached out and snatched my attention right from the start and just would not let go. The characters were very well rounded and had plenty of depth, you can easily see there is so much more to these men. Then the case itself had me guessing all along, first thinking one person was the leak on the team, but then thinking it was someone else...only to go back to the first person again. It's the kind of story that really pulls you so far in you think you're riding along right alongside the characters. 
 I felt for Aidan from the moment I knew his story, and hurt together with him. Jamie was fantastic-incredibly intelligent and really amazing at his job, and he matches up so well with Aidan. The heat and undeniable chemistry between them is evident immediately, and it leads to some torturous sexual tension that adds to the suspense of the cases to keep you on the edge of your seat. And you know what happens when all of that comes to a head, right? Jamie and Aidan are completely explosive together, and even though Aidan tries to hold Jamie at a distance you can see exactly where the two of them will end up. The fun part of it is how the author gets you there-by dangling your heart from a crazy thin wire while the action just continues to get more and more intense. 
 Everything about this book kept me guessing, and with the bit of a cliffhanger at the end I am so far past hooked for this series! Aidan and Jamie together are not to be missed, it's a rollercoaster ride through every page and I don't think I could have enjoyed this story more. I'm already counting down the days until the next book in the series comes out. The only thing I was a tad unsure about was the role Aidan's brother Danny played later in the story when the climax of the case was playing out at the port since he's not an agent and that fell under my heading of ""would it really happen like that in the real world?""...but otherwise this story was one of the most engaging, exciting reads I've had so far this year. 
 Single Malt was a fantastic 5-star read for me, and I highly recommend this to any fan of M/M romantic suspense-it will certainly add some excitement to your reading time! This book is meant for readers 18+ for adult language and M/M sexual content."
4,"I chose to listen to the audiobook - I wasn't sure if I'd want to go through this twice, and wanted to hear the audio version read by Wil Wheaton. This book has a definite audience, and I am on the edge of that demographic. Early in the book, I found the pop culturei found the references a little too plentiful, although I got all of them. 
 Although this was a story about video games and game developers, I felt like there were very obvious steve jobs/bill gates analogs in the characters that created the game in the story. More interesting to look at now that Steve Jobs has passed, although as far as I know he has not left an easter egg or his empire to someone. 
 Having played my share of video games, I did get into the feeling of being at that point where you need to beat the boss, finish the quest, and feel the adrenaline. There were points where everything worked out far too perfectly, but it also was obvious to me from the beginning that that's how it would end. Your princess is not in another castle. There were a few little twists and turns, but overall it was ambitious and well done and definitely enjoyable. 
 On a quick note regarding the audio version - I like Wil Wheaton, but I often found his voice in reading this to be a little close to the comic book guy on the Simpsons, and it just sounded patronizing. I do think he was the perfect choice for this book, it's just my own issue with his voice as I feel this way about him in many things I see him in lately."
4,"When I was in grade school, my best friend lived on the second and third floor of their funeral home. After awhile it did not seem weird to visit Ruth Ann at her house. To be honest, that is why I first picked up Fun Home. I thought, Oh, another family who lives in a funeral home. 
 I am not sure if the Bechdel family would have been better off if they had lived at the family's funeral home. They did not - they lived in a gothic revival house that Alison's dad worked at night and day. This meant the children, especially Alison spent much of their time working on the house. Since I don't come from a ""handy"" family this kind of childhood is very foreign to me. 
 This book is the story of secrets. Bechdel takes a hard look at her family especially her dad and how secrets change reality. Alison's dad was a closet homosexual. This hidden trait had influences over the whole family which you will have to read the book to learn more about. If you have ever been familiar with, or you, yourself are part of a family with a secret, you know that the secret changes everything. Bechdel does a great job of examining her family's history and how the secrets affected her relationship with her father. 
 As I said earlier the house they were working on was Gothic revival. I think that word Gothic is the important modifier for this book for a number of reasons. You may remember that Gothic is a style of fiction that emphasizes the grotesque, mysterious, and desolate. I felt that Bechdel's book also emphasizes these things. 
 This book is not for everyone. But with all that I have said, I was not sorry that I have read it and rereading it for this project reminded me that for this story words and pictures were the perfect medium."
4,"The story is definitely building, still don't know who to trust, still vastly dark. So many emotions I definitely do not know how Mac survives in this, she definitely is strong, and also can be weak, but to watch her grow is awesome too. A lot happens in this book but still not many answers. Still many many many questions, I just hope one day we will know what was thought or what so and so was doing and it'll all come together and make sense."
4,"This was a compelling read, and I loved the style and evocative language of the letters that make up the book. I also love the way that all the characters mature over time, as they grow and learn and move towards happiness. 
 I often wished that Celie would stand up for herself a lot more, but she comes into her own independence in time. Shug is my favorite character by far, and I like that a book with so much brutality and heartbreak concludes with such a happy ending. 
 The mixture of stories, moving back and forth between Celie and Nettie, America and Africa, deepens the narrative and expands the scope of the novel in a way that works very well to contrast the different lives led by the two sisters. 
 A great story, a good book, and an excellent read."
4,"I don't even know what to think about this book...I love and I hate it! 
 I can't believe it ended the way it did. 
 I just wanted to hug Thomas mulitple times. 
 I was so torn about Teresa, probably as much as Thomas was. 
 I want more."
3,"This was a funny, sexy, and lighthearted read. Jordan and Ryan were hot together, and I'm not usually a huge fan of books with this much sex in them, so that's saying something. I loved all the parts with the horses and there were lots of lines I wanted to read out loud. There weren't any big emotional moments in the book - it was just an easy light read."

4,"The Way We Fall is a very accurate title for this book; when the virus comes, some people will do anything to survive, even condemning others to death or directly killing them. This book is different from others that have recently come out in how it takes place in the present time and tell of the epidemic's beginning, rather than in the distant future where a virus has been running rampant for years. Of course even with everyone she's ever known dropping like flies, Kaelyn still finds the time to get a boyfriend. But even love can't save someone form the virus. (That's not a spoiler) The book is Kaelyn's journal, in which she documented the events following the outbreak. She address the entries to Leo, her best friend who moved to New York and she hasn't spoken to in years. The Way We Fall makes you wonder what you would do if you were ever trapped in a quarantine area as a mysterious virus killed everyone around you. Would you be at the hospital, helping people? Or would you steal all the food being brought in and kill anyone with the virus that you came across?

 (fair warning: I've had a lot of coffee so I'll try to make this as coherent as possible :/) 
 Ok so let me begin by saying that Penny has nerd-ed her way up into my Top Contemporary Romance Writers List. The capital letters are to let you know that I mean business and that this is a real list...that's in my head but still. Deserves capital letters. Kelsie! Kelsie! What does it take to be on that list?! First, simmer down, I will tell you. You MUST have the ability to warp my reality. What I mean by that is basically you have to write amazing fictional characters that generally ruin actual people for me. Penny (I'm speaking directly to Penny right now) you have created a world so vivid and filled with amazing characters that you have done this for me. Well done, you! 
 In all seriousness, Friends Without Benefits was so much more than what I was expecting. Now before you get your knickers in a knot, knowing that Penny wrote the book, I was expecting a fun/light rom-com with funny characters and some smexiness. Sounds pretty great right? What I got was all of that, but with so much more depth. Now don't worry, it's not so deep that we drown in angst. It's perfectly balanced because...wait for it....Nico Manjellomiello (I can't pronounce his name either ;). People. Nico. Niiiiico. Niccolo. Let me just tell you something about Nico: he is literally one of the sweetest, hottest guys I've ever read about. He is hilarious and sexy and SPEAKS ITALIAN. Y'all need to put on your fire proof panties while reading this because this sexy Italian stallion will quite literally set them on fire. 
 Now this brings us to our lovely Elizabeth/Lizzybella/Skinny Finney. I have no idea how Penny is able to write a completely different character from Janie in Neanderthal Seeks Human and STILL I am able to see so much of myself in her that it makes me wonder if I have a bit of a Sybil issue, but she does. She writes the every woman and girl nails it. I'm warning you right now, Elizabeth will most likely drive you nuts. She's a little looney and incredibly stubborn, but what I like about her is that she is realistic. She gets scared and she makes mistakes. I think it's the flaws in a character that allow a reader to relate so well to them and that my fellow Trotters is the difference between fluff and substance. And Penny Reid has substance in spades. 
 As for the secondary characters. It is established that I love the knitting club. I lurve them. They are my fictional besties and I am so frickin happy that they are getting their own books. Can I get a yeehaw?!....too Southern? Ok, no more yeehaws. Noted. Can I get a woot woot?! There we go! So yes, the friends. Love them. Also, lets give a hand to the break out stars that make up Nico's gigantic family. I'm Irish/Italian so I felt like Penny did a very good job of capturing the chaos. And it is chaos. His mother, Rose? Yes. Dead on. My mother has been trying to marry me off since I was legal so I can sympathize. Quick warning: there is Italian spoken in this book (I know right? So hot) but it doesn't get translated very often (if at all) so you'll be looking that stuff up. Especially during a certain...ahem...spicy scene. Wink. 
 In short, I loved it. I love this series. I have an author crush on Penny Reid. Gah, I really don't wanna flaunt that fact that I received an ARC but WOOHOOOOO I GOT AN ARC AND IT WAS AWESOME AND I LOVE PENNY REID'S BOOKS!!!! EEEEEEP! Ok. That was uncalled for. I'm sorry. So would I recommend this? I feel like asking/answering this question is redundant but I have a routine...so yes! I would totally recommend this book! This is book 2 in the series, but you can totally read them as standalones (that sounds so sad. That word. Standalones. You can totally read them as loners? recluses? friendless losers? Huh. I guess standalones is the best option for a name, but I digress....) since it doesn't come out for another few weeks why don't you read book 1 in the series while you wait?"
2,"So I enjoyed this book, but there was a LOT going on. Like, more than a lot. I realize that the HP series has a ridiculous amount of plot lines and events happening, but this one was jam packed and things were hard to keep track of. Also, it's tough remembering what kid belongs to each family member... I need a chart!"
3,"In short: The Mad Scientist's Daughter by Cassandra Rose Clarke is an angst-ridden robot love story. Unfortunately, it wasn't the book for me. 
 Don't be fooled by the mention of robots in the summary for The Mad Scientist's Daughter; the story is more of a tragic romance than science fiction. The Mad Scientist's Daughter tells the story of Cat and her relationship with an android named Finn. The story spans several decades of Cat's life, starting at age 8 and continuing to her mid-thirties, and follows her struggle to come to terms with her feelings for Finn. I was surprised at how different The Mad Scientist's Daughter was from Cassandra Rose Clarke's debut YA novel, The Assassin's Curse, which is a book I LOVED. Where The Assassin's Curse was light and fast-paced, The Mad Scientist's Daughter was almost depressing in tone and quite harsh to read in comparison. 
 The source of this depressing tone is Cat, the mad scientist's daughter, and the novel's narrator. She is also the main source of my frustration with The Mad Scientist's Daughter. She is a terribly broken person, struggling to find meaning in her life, and I am sympathetic to that - I am, really. But at some point I just wanted her to take control of her life, rather than drifting through it and letting bad things happen to her. She does do this eventually, but unfortunately very late in the story. Prior to that, she agrees to enter into a marriage she knows will not bring her happiness and that leaves her hollow and miserable. And she returns to an abusive relationship time and time again. She is also a terrible user - using Finn as an object for sex, never once bothering to think how that might make him feel despite her supposed care for him. I was never able to form an emotional connection with Cat. 
 The Mad Scientist's Daughter is above all a romance. An incredibly angst-ridden one, at that. Now, the focus on the romance is an automatic dislike for me as I prefer to read plots where the main source of conflict doesn't revolve around the romance. And throw in the angst into the equation and it was almost too much for me to take. I was bored. The plot DRAGS and though I felt this was a good reflection of the lack of meaning and tediousness of Cat's life, it was still incredibly boring for me to read. I would have liked to explore the world more as I felt there was loads of untapped potential surrounding the ethics and rights of owning a sentient being, and THIS was what I was interested in most. 
 Ultimately, The Mad Scientist's Daughter clearly just wasn't the book for me and my critiques are all reflective of my personal biases. I do still maintain that Cassandra Rose Clarke is a great writer with a talent for enduring romances. I also really enjoyed the subtle world building and the fact that it was light on the science fiction elements. I believe that there are many people that would enjoy and appreciate The Mad Scientist's Daughter more than I did and I hope it finds its audience. Recommended for romance and robot sex enthusiasts."

 At first you're left in the dark about lots of things. No answers, none whatsoever as to how or why the world became what it was until you get halfway through. But I still didn't really care about this post-apocalyptic world. There is something cruel about the predator and prey ""game."" They hunt people instead of animals for sport. It's bad enough to murder animals if you weren't going to eat them to survive but killing human beings because they're not set to their standards??? It's sickening. I couldn't stand the fact that they were hunting people who were deemed by this society as ""Less Than."" The way they classify people in this futuristic post apocalyptic world is a little horrifying. These are the forbidden categories: Radiation Deformities, Homosexuality, Incompatible Skin Colour, Political Dissidents, Nonapproved Religious Affiliations, Mentality Infirm. I can't even deal with any of that. It makes them Less Than.. Less than a human being is anyone follows this. So basically all the characters are people of colour which I vehemently applaud but the story just lacked character development. 
 I tried to get into this story but I just couldn't. So many short clipped sentence fragments, way too much dialogue, and instant love which became too nauseating to read. And I just didn't care what the reason behind this predator or prey game they had or the fact they're experimenting on twins. 
 Got 43% into it and couldn't keep going. I tried really but I couldn't bring myself to finish this.

4,"Really, really liked this book. Review to come."
4,"I acquired this title because of all of the positive buzz I've heard about it and that it has been compared to Gone Girl. I enjoyed it quite a bit, it was one of those few books that really do hold (in fact build upon) your interest even though the whodunit part was fairly easily deciphered relatively early on. I won't spoil it by detail the plot points, suffice it to say that even though it starts a bit slow it continues to build though to the end. None of the characters are particularly likable, they all have significant character flaws, they do suck you in and provide some surprises in how the conclusion is reached."
1,"I thought that I would love this from synopsis but this didn't live up to that. We are told repeatedly that Lexi comes off as perfect at school but I didn't find anything in the book that actually supported that. This was more along the lines of how I pictured her. 
 She drinks, smokes and messes around with guys. I know what you are thinking that I should love her since self destructive mc's are my thing but there is nothing to Lexi, she brakes the cardinal rule you can be selfish as long as you are interesting. 
 Lexi has had a crush on Ben for two years and I couldn't begin to tell you why. We know nothing about Ben other than he serial dates and breaks up with girls for no reason, including one of Lexi's friends. After dating Ben for 3.5 seconds he starts controlling her; telling her what to wear, doing only things he wants to do and makes her stop hanging out with her best friend. Lexi lets all of this happen because she has liked him for so long!! 
 By the end I didn't care about anything or anyone."
2,"Liked how Jacob, Bella, Noah and Elijah still feature strongly in this book (too often in series like these, the past couple is only mentioned in passing). Liked how the plot develops and mythos of the Nightwalkers expands. Found Gideon boring and the chemistry between him and Magdalena almost nonexistent, almost as if I were watching a televised debate instead of reading a paranormal romance. Sadly there was more tension between our hero and heroine in the first book then this one. Recommend reading this ""romance"" just for the plot development =)"

3,"One of the book challenges I am participating in this year asked me to read a classic novel featuring an animal. While trying to decide on which book to choose for that category, my husband recommended Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by Philip K. Dick. While not a classic in the usual sense, the novel is absolutely classic science fiction, which I figured would be good enough to suit the challenge rules. After all, it was the inspiration for the movie Blade Runner, and how much more classic sci-fi can you get? My husband and I normally prefer vastly different reading material, but I like to explore different kinds of fiction so I agreed to give it a try. 
 The story takes place in a dystopian future (is there any other kind?) where nuclear fallout from World War Terminus has rendered Earth nearly uninhabitable. Most of the people on the planet have emigrated to a colony on Mars to escape the blanket of radioactive dust that covers everything. Mars isn't exactly the most hospitable place to live, so to tempt people to relocate the government gifts everyone who emigrates with an extremely sophisticated android- a mechanical servant that is nearly indistinguishable from normal humans. Most of these androids live out their lives in servitude without a hitch, but some become dissatisfied with slavery and escape back to Earth to try and live as humans. This is strictly forbidden on Earth, and the government employs departments of bounty hunters whose jobs are to go out and find these fugitive androids and ""retire"" them (i.e. kill them). 
 Rick Deckard is one of these bounty hunters. At the beginning of the novel he is given a difficult assignment- to go out and kill six androids who escaped Mars and are now living on Earth in his jurisdiction of the San Francisco Bay area of California. The androids he is hunting are identical to humans in every way, except they can't feel empathy towards others. That is the difference that Rick's department relies on to discover their identities. As Rick embarks on his dangerous mission, he is disturbed to discover that his feelings towards his job are souring. He is starting to feel empathy for the androids, and this emotion is hindering his ability to do his job properly. He begins to questions everything, from what makes someone human to how God views his actions. 
 Interspersed with the story of Rick is the story of J.R. Isidore. He is mentally deficient due to the radiation on Earth, so he has trouble understanding most things. He ends up trying to help some of the escaped androids that take up residence in his building. This gives the reader a split view of the story - we see the pursuit of the androids through Rick and the androids' attempts to survive through J.R. Both perspectives are interesting to read, although a lot more time is spent with Rick. 
 One aspect of the novel that I really enjoyed was how PKD integrated animals into the plot. The radioactive dust the is slowly poisoning the people left on Earth has decimated the animal population. Since animals are now so rare, to own and care for one is a huge status symbol. Animals as small as spiders cost thousands of dollars, with bigger animals going for even more exorbitant prices. Before the plot of the story picks up, we are told that Dick used to own a sheep, but it contracted tetanus and died. He replaced it with a very lifelike electric sheep, but caring for a fake animal does not give him the same satisfaction. Part of the reason the Rick is anxious to track down androids is for the bonus that retiring one will give him. He desperately wants a real animal to give meaning to his life. This idea of animals being valuable and obsessed over is carried throughout the novel and I found this concept to be very creative. I can't imagine being happy to see a spider, but maybe if there were no other animals around, I would be. Animals are important to the story because they make people feel more human and less hopeless. I think this reflects how many people feel about their pets now. To see it exaggerated in this way was a cool concept. 
 The action of the story was well paced and moved very quickly. This is a fairly slim novel and a very quick read. One issue I had with it was how important details we not fully explained. Characters would just come out with bits of information and won't go on to fully describe what they are talking about. As a result, I was semi-confused pretty frequently. I do believe this was intentional on the part of PKD, but I'm not a reader who enjoys wondering if I'm really ""getting"" the story all the time. When I was finished reading, I looked up a plot summary to make sure that I understood everything. I pretty much did, but I feel like the book left a lot of unexplained details and plot points that I would have liked to have known, especially about Mercerism, the main religion in the story and what happened to Rick during his religious epiphany. 
 The ending of the novel is an odd mixture of confusing and sweet. I felt like it chopped itself off at a weird point, but that's par for the course for this novel, and for PKD I'm told. I did enjoy my reading experience. Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep is very creative and interesting, and I believe most fans of science fiction would enjoy this ride."
4,"Oh. My. Goodness. I loved this book. Once I started I couldn't put it down. Logan is hot. Evie is hot. Payton is hot. The story was hot. The sex was hot. Everything was just super hot. 
 Hot is a horrible adjective to describe this book. It doesn't do it justice. Too....blargh. 
 But my brain is to rattled and still living in that world to try and think of a better one."
4,"An overly long, plodding start makes Dance feel like a long read...right up until a promising ending leaves you salivating for the next installment. Dance is an example of a once perfect series struggling under the weight of a mass of characters and story-lines. The end however leaves hope that perhaps the divergent tales that were divided in Feast may once again all be married into one page turning tome in book #6."
0,"Has a really cute and heartwarming moment at the beginning, but then it gets depressing. Apparently there is a happy ending but ... meh. Not in the mood for this particular flavor of unhappy middle."
3,"i give this book 3.5 
 mild spoilers ahead. 
 Now i finally understand why i didn't totally fall in love with Keith in the first book, i (and Ginny) were waiting for Oliver. Boy i loved him from the moment we first met him ( i am kinda partial to tall guys so maybe i am biased... but ahh well) Actually i gotta say i kinda hated Keith in this book, he was such an ass and i wished Ginny had stuck up for Oliver earlier in the book. And i gotta say at the beginning of the book when Ginny is going to see Keith after arriving in London i just knew what was going to happen and i nearly stopped reading because i was so embarrassed that Ginny hadn't figured it out yet. but i am glad that i did keep reading, this was an equally exciting ride as the first book, i especially like the art in this one... the three parts were such a cool idea. who knew you could do that? 
 Throughout reading this book i loved how maureen Johnson balanced humour and sadness in one neat package, even though i think Ginny was braver in the last book... i mean after all that she was scared to break into the coffee shop? 
 Anyway, great follow up book, i will definitely look into some of the other books by Maureen Johnson."
5,Absolutely heart wrenching!!!! I love Ash's character and I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. It certainly did NOT disappoint!
3,"i don't know quite how to feel about this book. when i finished it, i could only think, ""that's it??"" but i had more charitable opinions less than an hour later, reading the author's afterward and thinking again about what i'd read. this was a harder book than i'd bargained for. i knew going in it wasn't going to be a fun space opera, but i don't think i was really prepared for how -- well, hard to read it is. which i suppose is kind of the point. the whole final act is the difficulty of confession, both for the speaker and the listener, and while it's a bit on the nose to say giuliani and candotti are standing in for us as readers, it seems true enough. 
 but there were also aspects of both story and writing that frustrated me, beyond the difficulty of the subject matter. i hated emilio. he is one of those leading men i feel forced into loving because the narrative repeatedly beats me over the head with how wonderful and charming he is, how loved by everyone else. his flaws are forgivable; his achievements, incontrovertibly sublime. i found him less charming than snotty, less amusing and witty than the kind of person at a dinner party who won't shut the fuck up about all the wonderful, amazing, beautiful things they saw on a recent trip to thailand when you just asked if he could pass the salt. you know the type. sucks up all the air in the room. criticisms of his character can probably be combatted with claims about his compassion, or his penitence, or his lifelong devotion to god, or whatever. but this book is blowing so much smoke up this dude's ass, by the time everything happens to him (and, really, it's...everything), i was almost thrilled just to see a character not immediately fall head over heels in love with him. which is hysterical, really, because that's exactly what happens anyway. 
 the other characters were also grating, but less so. they felt more solid, even if i frequently just wanted them to stop making joke after joke after joke. it was like an endless lunch with lorelai and rory gilmore at their most obnoxious and quippy. the frequent paragraphs devoted to people dissolving into laughter at some great witticism were exhausting. it would have been less so if it wasn't every single person in the party, like MDR didn't know how to write someone who wasn't the soul of wit, a fount of cleverness, thousands of pop culture references on their tongue. two jesuit priests from disparate backgrounds, 50 years in the future, can accurately and at length quote the princess bride to each other. i know this book was written twenty years ago, but i almost had to put my kindle down and walk away when i read that nonsense. 
 i disliked how ultimately human the aliens were. maybe this was the point of the story, but it just felt like a copout, that all this suffering was brought about by aliens who act more like people than anything else. the book spent so, so, so much time building up the alien social philosophies of the Runa, that the ultimate climax of the book being the basically human impulses of the Jana'ata felt...cheap. and again, maybe that was the point. the equality between carnivores even on different planets, humans made prey as they've done to other species, etc etc. but it felt cheap. after so much of the book being, basically, an anthropological study of this alien planet (makes sense, with MDR being an anthropologist), i just...wanted more. 
 which i guess is how i feel about the book as a whole. i wanted more, and i don't mean because it was so interesting i'm craving more of the world. everything felt flat. opportunities were lost. sometimes i appreciated it--places in the book that seemed inevitably leading to a dramatic twist or drama simply petered out in a way that felt natural and more true-to-life. but i'm not reading an article in smithsonian magazine; i'm reading a novel, and sometimes you want the twists and drama. the loss of several characters in the end was so slapdash it almost seemed like MDR had forgotten she needed to do it. 
 maybe my opinion of this will change with distance. there were some truly beautiful passages, and every so often the author would have a way of building very slowly to a sort of suspenseful one-liner that i enjoyed, even if that suspense either didn't pay off or ended in some unexpectedly mundane place. the writing, while often somewhat clinical, was lovely. i probably would have liked this book a lot more if it was about anyone but emilio. oh, well."
4,"At some point in the past, I've overindulged in PNR genre, and just couldn't stomach it anymore. But I've never read PNR M/M before, so I've decided to give it a try. And I'm glad I did, because it was a very entertaining read. 
 Despite the slow beginning and too many technical details, I got hooked somewhere around 40% of it, and found the THIRDS adorable. I know they were supposed to come across as a special professional military organisation, but their childish bickering and immature behaviour made it hard for me to take them seriously. I loved their bond and affection towards each other, and often found myself laughing at their quips and witty remarks. 
 Dex is a real child-man. Such a sweetheart. I loved his ability to charm everybody around him and smile even when he hurt. I thought Sloane was a perfect match for him, too. They've had a good chemistry. And the sexual tension between these two was off the charts. The sparks were flying! 
 However, the mystery part of the book was quite predictable and not very well executed, in my opinion. I've guessed who's the bad guy and how he's done it from the beginning. So it didn't manage to keep me on my toes like a good mystery normally would. But, having said that, the romance here had more than made up for it. Just the right amount of angst and drama for me, it was very engaging, sexy and fun. 
 I fell in love with the THIRDS guys and I'm looking forward to the second book in the series in hope not only to see more of Dex and Sloane, but to witness some other characters getting their HEA too. Cael and Ash, for instance, please? That would be nice ;) 
 ***3.8 stars***"

5,"This is, quite possibly, the best collection of short stories I've ever read. My only complaint is that I'd get super interested and invested right as the story was ending. I often wanted more! But the writing is so good, and the topic is fascinating. Great collection all around. 
 Thank you to the publisher and Netgalley for providing me with this book in exchange for an honest review."
5,"OMG OMG I LOVE IT! So many things to say, I'll update the review later. 
 In short, it's short and sweet, but still makes you laugh while making your heart cringes at the same time. I love the interaction between the hero and heroine. OMG their conversations are priceless! 
 Oh, and the hero. Probably one of my fav heroes of all times. A musician. Not the mega-rockstar kind of sort. Just a very talented musician that loves music with his soul. Perrrrfect!"
5,"Human scientists are trying to learn about the Ilmatarans, a blind deep-sea dwelling species that lives next to sea vents. But the Sholen, another alien race, and the humans have a no-contact treaty, so the human scientists have to settle for blurry drone pictures. Until one man, Henri Kerlerec, decides to wade in among the Ilmataran, using a sonar deflecting suit to be ""invisible."" Instead, he's caught and dissected as an unknown animal. 
 His mistake leads to more than his death--the Sholen will determine if the humans were at fault for breaking the treaty, and some of them are determined to go to extremes to prevent contamination. 
 The non-humans in this story are pretty interesting--not humans with tweaks, but well-developed individuals, with history and culture suited to their environment. Which means there's plenty of communication issues--even when they know they don't quite understand the other species, there's a tendency among all three to think they know what to do to get a certain reaction. And they're nearly always wrong. 
 The complex, descriptive surroundings, characters, and language mean there's a lot of politics, too. Everyone is interested in getting what they want out of the problem facing them, and the conflicting goals make for a lot of action. In a few places, the plot is a little confusing, as the separate groups split and converge, but they do come together in the end. 
 A fascinating read for fans of science fiction, truly 'alien' nonhumans, or those interested in science and/pr politics."
4,"Ahhhh what happened next? 
 I first saw this book in this year Goodreads's choice awards. It's been a beautiful yet thrilling read. Hm-Mm.. and when I figured the next book will come out next summer. Oh well..."
2,"A generous 2 stars. Nothing great here -- the original premise a little enticing about Heidi Wood, 40-something social worker and mother of a 12-year old daughter, married to Chris, financial rainmaker, who sees a homeless girl and baby in the dreary relentless rain of a Chicago April. After repeated sightings, Heidi insists that ""Willow"" and the baby ""Ruby"" come home with her where they reside in a bizarro bunker-like scenario for about a week. During this time, Heidi slowly unravels and as each principal character narrates alternating chapters, the reader learns of Heidi's desire for more children, her difficulties with her adolescent daughter, her cervical cancer and hysterectcomy and the related abortion of what would've been her second child. Meanwhile, Chris is tempted to commit adultery at work, and there is a neighbor who has the hots for Heidi. All this feels rather contrived. In Willow's chapters, she is speaking to an Assistant DA in a jail cell, so there is the teaser of a crime committed. Is this street girl a psychopath? Are Heidi and her family in danger? Chris is on the road as usual, so he worries and tries to sort things out from afar, hiring a PI to try to get info about this mysterious girl and baby. Meanwhile, Heidi's grip on reality falters. The delivery of all this falls flat and there are gaps in the plausibility of all characters' stories -- though not in any intentional sense that would've enhanced the suspense and drama. There isn't even the last minute ""save"" and zinger of Kubica's The Good Girl, which is what kept me slogging thru to the end."
3,"I quite enjoyed the story as well as the beautiful language used by Wilde, but I just could not connect with or even tolerate any of the characters which kind of ruined it for me."
3,"The plot is compelling, but the characterizations seem a bit thin in this one. I wanted more development of characters I've now spent 1,500 pages with, but instead got a lot more plot. In the first two books, the reader was teased with backstory about Holden's secretive crew, but now it seems as though it's on a permanent back burner. I like fast-paced as much as anyone, but if I'm not attached to the characters running the show, the stakes are low. I also miss the strains of horror and suspense from the first book. This book was more about a political conflict drifting into violence. That can be interesting, but I signed up for monsters with this book, not politics. I also didn't like the POV characters as much as in the first two books. Although I'm not sure anyone will ever beat Avasarala's caustic voice."

 (will explain in review) 
 Audio Only Rating 4.00 
 NOTE: I really wish I could review this book in 2 parts because I think the 2nd half of the book was very strong and made me look forward to the rest of the series. However, I do highly recommend the audio version of Stray. I think Jennifer Van Dyck did an excellent job with the narration. 
 What I Loved: Kudos to Rachel Vincent to writing a strong family unit. I absolutely adored the fact that there was a mother, father, brothers, and extended family involved in the story. They are, in fact, the moments that I loved most. The whole second half of the story (not going to include spoilers) the way they pulled together was uplifting and fantastic to read. The world that Rachel has created is very well done also. I like how she divided down the packs, territory, and the explanations of the strays. It reminded me a lot of Old England and their hierarchies. I really loved the strong mother figure in the story and how it was her role that really reminds everyone to look deeper than the surface. Everyone has layers, makes choices, and has their reasons for doing it. 
 What I Liked: I have to say that the male pack members were all very enjoyable to read. Their personalities ran the gamete from fun/playful to serious/contemplating. Personally, it was great to see a little bit of every kind of ""person"" reflected in this world. There were some unfinished things that I think will play out over the series and I can't wait to see what happens! 
 Complaints: Seriously did not like Faythe for 3/4 of the story. I thought she was childish, spoiled, self-involved, and a little to ""I deserve this"" for my taste. Towards the end though it appeared she did some growing up. I just hope it sticks! 
 Why I gave it a 3.25: This is one of those stories I wish I could grade in parts: Faythe (2.75), Story 1rst Part (3.5), Story 2nd Part (4.0), and Character (4.0). Unfortunately, Faythe really did pull some of the enjoyment out of reading the first part of the story for me. However, I am really looking forward to the rest of the series and can't wait to see where some of these characters go. Also looking forward to Faythe acting more like the grownup she claims to be :)"
5,"Frankly, The Night Circus is a confusing book. I've read some reviews on this site, and it seems people are divided over whether they like the book or not. As for me personally, I like the book. It's unique. It's a fun read, because the author has definitely thought things through in terms of the circus set up in the book. 
 But, if asked if the book is about magic or magicians? Well, I would say it's not completely about magic or magicians. Perhaps, ultimately, this book is about love. It's about life, fate and destiny. Or, even this book is about the history of storytelling itself. People just making up stories for the sake of entertainment. 
 Basically, a significant portion of the story is about Marco and Celia, two people who are brought up with competing magic school of thoughts. They're bound (or fated) to compete against each other, where ultimately the loser would die (implied). One significant part of the story deals with how each of them tries to find each other, falls in love with each other, and then try to change their ""fate"". In a sense, yes it is a love story. 
 However, The Night Circus is more than just Marco and Celia. In fact, I believe the book also questions how our actions, decisions or non-decisions may affect other people. The book questions is fate set in stone, or is fate something that is a result of your decisions and the decisions of others? Is it fair if someone suffers some negative consequence because of your actions? The book provides several characters' points of view, and that's what I think makes this book very interesting, yet also confusing at the same time. Especially, because the timeline is not exactly linear, so you gotta keep track of who's who and when's a particular event is happening. 
 I also think the book is about celebrating the magical power of storytelling itself! (spoiler alert) 
 (view spoiler)[ At the end of the novel, Widget sits down with Alexander and requests full transfer of the ownership of the circus to Bailey, Poppet and Widget. Alexander requests Widget to tell him a story and Widget complies by starting to tell the story about the circus itself, saying ""The circus arrives without warning"", implying that the whole book is based on Widget's interpretation of everything that happens, or his made-up stories. (hide spoiler)] 
 Overall, it's a beautiful book. It's a book meant to be enjoyed, savored that will also make you think a little bit. Although, I'm still missing a few explanations, but I think I'll get those after I re-read the book. 4.5 stars!"
1,Nop...Nothing. No interest at all for me in this story. Characters I did not care for and too much teen drama for my taste.
4,"I originally read this back in January 2007 and have read it 2 or three times since. I totally enjoy this book. It wasn't my first introduction to Kenyon's Dark Hunters series as I started with Unleash the Night first and then realized I needed to go back in the series. In this book you get glimpses of people, places and characters that you get to know more of as the series goes on and the nice thing is that Grace and Julien don't disappear as the series goes on, in fact Julien ends up making several appearences which is why I love Kenyon as a craftsman, she has this whole world that keeps evolving and interacting. It totally does it for me. If you are going to read Kenyon . . read from the start, you won't be disappointed. 
 Grace is turning 29 and her friend Lanie buys her a book, that supposedly has a Greek Love Slave trapped within its pages and upon summoning, he will appear for 30 days and be your love slave. As a joke Grace goes along and does the incantation. A while later a Greek God is standing naked waiting at her beck and command. A lot of hilarity, hot sex, Greek/Spartan history, and a HEA."
5,"Wow! Really fabulous. The H/h were both fully formed and their relationship, how they met, how they came to love was all so believable. Not an ordinary romance at all but the plot did focus only on them. She struggled with what her faith taught her and besides his obvious issues he also developed as a person. I liked that the end result wasn't to turn from her upbringing completely."
4,"4.5 stars (and on the way to 5 wonderful and heartbroken stars) 
 Wow! I wasn't expecting Legend to be this good!So far it is one of the most action packed books I have ever read! 
 I loved the lead characters...Day and June are simply fantastic. I adore kick-ass, strong but compassionate characters. 
 My poor Metias...I'm so sorry for him, it was heartbreaking read June's memory of him. He was such a wonderful guy *sniffs*. 
 As for Thomas and the commander...I hope they die! 
 This book was so ""strong""...the conditions of the poor, the unfairness of it all, the violence people were subjected to...it made me cringe but at the same time it made everything feel even more ""real"". 
 . 
 The author has a sleek but very detailed style, easy to read but with no lack of details (the clothes, the clothes...wow!), the world building was good and so very cool! 
 In conclusion, it was a very good book"
5,"*Sigh* 
 Had some reporter asked me now how I feel about this book, I would've answered I feel content for getting the best closure possible and sad for saying 'goodbye' to Tony, Mac and their friends and families. 
 This has become one of my favourite series, with real characters I couldn't get enough of, mysteries I was actually eager to see solved and the flowing, down-to-earth writing that kept me hooked to this imaginary world that felt too true to be a fiction. 
 Mac and Tony's is the relationship I admire most - strong, loving, with mutual support, COMMUNICATION, understanding and, when problems arise, with compromise and selflessness. To witness them grow together was one of the most rewarding journeys every step of the way. I'm just hoping that maybe, Ms Harper willing, we would see more of them sometime soon. 
 ***4.5 stars*** 
 Read with Sofia and Ingela, even though I am, as always, the slowest :)"
2,"Actual Rating: 2.5 
 I love you. Remember. They cannot take it. 
 I think I struggled hard with reading and rating this book. While I liked the writing for the most part, the book proved to be a bit slow. I understand that it's not a fast-paced plot, but the storytelling itself wasn't an attention-grabber. Pretty much, nothing jumped out of the page to make it exciting. 
 Delirium tackles an intriguing and, somewhat, unique premise, which constitutes the idea of love as an abomination, as a disease that needs to be cured. I think some of us have fantasized about curing our residual feelings or unrequited feelings at least once. 
 This book takes that concept and applies it to the idea of love in general; romantic love, platonic love, religious love, unconditional love and many more. The dystopian world in Delirium has banned love, and labeled it as ""amor deliria nervosa"", which can be mostly displayed by physical symptoms. 
 The book's protagonist Lena Halloway falls victim to the disease a few months before she's to receive her treatment. The guy who infects her and turns her world upside down is Alex. For a book that considers love to be a taboo, I felt like the chemistry/romance between Lena and Alex should have been a bright shining beacon in the book, but it just ended up being dull and uninspiring. 
 While the process of the two of them falling for each other was slightly sweet, it didn't really hold much innocence to it, considering that Lena was experiencing an emotion that she supposedly hadn't really felt before. Also, there really wasn't much concrete foundation on why these two were drawn to each other, other than infatuation. There wasn't any strong proof that made us believe they were really in love with each other, especially since such an emotion was dangerous. Alex mostly seemed one dimensional. 
 In addition, Oliver's dystopian classifies love as a disease, but I felt like she just focused on the surface of it, like just the word itself and the physical characteristics that come with it. But love isn't just about what you can see or its declaration. It's more than that. She doesn't dig deeper into the society, into the effects of love being outlawed. And what of the other emotions love instigates? It's almost as if she just focuses on the issue it creates for Alex and Lena's romance. While I get that it's more about the central characters, a dystopian book usually tackles the issues from a broader perspective and then applies it to the characters. 
 The whole idea of not being with the one you love can make you want/decide to kill yourself seemed a bit undeveloped to me. Especially since it dealt with it from a Romeo and Juliet aspect (then again, I'm not a big fan of that particular work by Shakespeare). What about the love one has for their children? Isn't that supposed to count too? In this dystopian society, do mothers also kill themselves when they can't show their children love? What happens to the children who need love from their parents? How does it affect their childhood? Lena was brought up with love in her earlier years, but she isn't contrasted with children who had such a deficiency. Children whose mothers never showed them affection behind closed curtains. 
 However, though the book does have some issues. I enjoyed the writing. Oliver's prose is beautiful, in the sense that it's almost poetic. But it doesn't really give much substance to the slow moving plot. I'm probably going to keep reading, because I want to satisfy my curiosity on if (view spoiler)[Hana was the one who outed Alex and Hana, it seemed predictable if she did, but it may add an interesting layer to the story (hide spoiler)] 
 Overall, Delirium left much to be desired. Hopefully, the sequel is better."
5,"I first learned of Dan Simmons from his story ""This Year's Class Picture,"" in the Living Dead anthology, and loved it so much I wrote a Saturday Spotlight about him and this story. One of the benefits of this blog series has been learning new writers to follow, and notice when I'm perusing spines at the book store. This was how I found SUMMER OF NIGHT, at Half Price Books. The idea of a bunch of sixth graders fighting ghosts in a small town one summer sounded appealing, and fit right in as research for a Cub Scout zombie story I was working on. The paperback is 600 pages long, but I finished it today concluding that it is one of my favorite Horror reads. For me, the difference between a 4 and a 5 star book is whether you finish it with a ""wow"" feeling. That's how this book ended, and I couldn't be more satisfied. 
 The first chapter is four pages describing the setting and this creepy school prior to it being shut down, Old Central. Normally, I'm not one for long descriptions of setting; those types of books take too long to read. But, Dan is an excellent writer who uses precise images to pull you into his story as if you were actually there. He does the same thing with the cast of characters, showing us how they live, what circumstances create their personalities, and what drives them. Some reviewers have said this book is long-winded, but I say it is just right. Pick up this novel expecting a journey with the characters, not a glimpse from afar. The ending is very much worth the wait. In between you will get top-notch creepy, teeth-clenching action and a rag-tag group of underdog six graders to root for against an ancient evil. Dan didn't win the Locus Award for this book for nothing. Highest recommendation. 
 He wrote a sequel, A WINTER HAUNTING, which I am thrilled about, because I don't want to say goodbye to these characters. Please don't go check out the info on this book though because there are spoilers about what happens in SUMMER OF NIGHT. I'm only mentioning it because your investment into these characters does not end with this first book. More so, your investment in reading Dan Simmons will no doubt lead to a catalog of other excellent books, as he has award-winning titles in many genres aside from Horror."
1,Majorly skimmed at the end. Wasn't super interested in the character and just wanted to see how the author chose to wrap it up.

 Having a British husband with a wicked sense of humor, I have had to set a strict no-kilts rule within my household. I know what they (don't) wear under those things.... 
 Pretty swoon-worthy."
3,"It was a very enjoyable read but it lacks the quality and believability of other better written YA books. When the characters get stuck things just randomly happen to progress the plot, they seem to always run into a monster by accident even though it says in the book multiple times they're supposed to attract monsters, not the other way around. The story is fun, the characters are ok, but it's just not original enough and the story is meh. Check it out for fun, but don't expect to be hooked on a new series."

4,"I picked this up on a whim at the library because I know several friends revere it. I didn't think I'd care for it at all at first, but stuck with it and came to appreciate it. It asks some big questions and doesn't totally provide answers, which I think is appropriate considering the questions. The art is beautiful."

3,"This one didn't grip me as much as the previous book, maybe because the idea of Guayota seemed too... out there. Also, I didn't like the way Mercy handled Christy - Mercy always held back because Christy was Juan Flores' victim but that didn't change the fact that she was a major bitch and I didn't like that Mercy allowed her to run rampant in her home, family and pack. She should've told her off more sternly. I was disappointed in Mercy this time around. 
 What I loved was Warren and Kyle - as usual - Joel, Tad, Honey, Gary Laughingdog and his connection to Mercy and, of course, Coyote. Oh, and the walking stick, naturally!"

 The writing was wonderful, catchy and smooth (aside from those annoyingly overused expletives--""Judas Priest"" and ""Jesus Haploid Christ""--ehm, wait, what?) 
 Tyler, whom I didn't care for all that much during the first book, really grew on my during this one. Memphis, of course, was adorable like he was meant to be. 
 Alec and Dylan from book one made a few cameos, and I loved meeting them again; I especially loved to see insecure Dylan giving and receiving advice from Tyler, of all people. As Tyler and Memphis's relationship grew closer, so did their group of friends. Meeting Julissa was another pro; she's a great female character, so well developed even in her rather minor role that I almost wished she'd get her own book at some point. 
 However, I somewhat missed Noah. Even though much of the book was set at his place, Noah's presence wasn't as strongly felt as it was during the first book. Since Noah is kind of like the glue that keeps them all together (and my secret favorite of them all, admittedly) I was glad to see a new scrap of development during the epilogue, hinting at Noah finding happiness of his own in the not-so-far future. 
 It's always hard to come up with a reason for a decade-long separation of ""star-crossed"" lovers. Although the reasons for Memphis's taking off in the first place took some suspension of disbelief, they were toroughly explored later and explained to a point where I almost--almost could relate... which was the biggest issue I had with the book: the almost, even more so since I couldn't quite put my finger on what actually bothered me about Memphis and Tyler's breakup-and-reunion-trope. IN the end, I guess it might've been a case of it's not the book, it's me, so... as taste is subjective, I think other readers need to find out for themselves. 
 Overall, this was an enjoyable and commendable read, although I'm looking forward to Noah's story even more now."
3,"I read quite a few YA post-apocalyptic, dystopian books and I'd say this is about average. It fits within the genre without redefining or contributing in any meaningful way. The writing is clean, almost too clean and sparse, with a lack of exposition that I almost missed. The story is told in three parts and the first part is the best. It grabbed me right from the start and I sped through the first half. The second and third parts definitely slowed and while it's an easy book to read, and very quick despite the 400-page length, I didn't love the second and third parts as much. I'll probably continue with the series if the next book comes out pretty soon but if too much time passes I'll forget about the series and probably not even cares what happens. 
 Amy is the narrator and the premise revolves around her survival. She happens to be at home watching TV when the world ends, almost literally. Aliens descend on the world, ""Them,"" and Amy miraculously survives the initial devastation. She eventually encounters a silent toddler she names Baby and Amy immediately takes care of the girl. Together they have to outwit the aliens, other humans, and the elements before they're rescued by a contingent of humans working to re-establish the human race and society. However, Amy's not sure she agrees with their tactics or their choices. 
 Although the book does get into the consequences of human actions and choices in the later parts of the book, the story stays firmly in action. The first part drops the reader immediately into the chaos and fear of the life Amy is living, trying to survive. Most information is told through flashbacks as Amy pieces together her experiences with her hard won knowledge. We see how she came to live the way she did and this is the first hurdle to get over. Amy just so happens to live in the perfect house. Her father was a hippy conservative so she has a rooftop garden, solar energy, silent appliances, hot showers, power, and water. While her mother was a paranoid government official so she also has access to weapons and an electrical fence. Although extremely unlikely and convenient, I could get over this obvious manipulation because she frankly should have died anyway despite all her lucky breaks. 
 However, there is so much action and the stark writing helps gives the first part a hair-raising, heart-pounding vibe, that it's easy to forgive the story manipulations. Likewise there's no way Baby would have survived, but the story tries valiantly to give explanations that make it ok. Again, it's a reach and the biggest is when Amy tries to help Amber, but I was engaged in their survival regardless. I started to have some misgivings when Amy and Baby are forced to leave and get rescued by the New Hope society. Here the story slows down considerably, the two aren't fighting on a daily, it not hourly basis, to survive. Instead it's the dilemma of other survivors they have to navigate. I was disappointed that the connection between Baby and Amy that drives much of the first part is diluted here as Amy has a lukewarm romance and throws herself into conspiracy theories. 
 Throughout the book, Amy is written as a hard-ass, tough, intelligent, capable survivor. She has incredible intuition and solid fighting skills that all come from living alone in this post-apocalyptic world. Yet, she continues to make numerous mistakes. I think this is an attempt to humanize her and show her relatively young age and immaturity in the ""Before."" Sometimes it worked and sometimes it made her seem so foolish and stupid. The second half flash-forwards foreshadow the consequences of Amy's foolishness, which kept me from really liking or identifying with her. She gets into trouble of course and the reader knows what will happen before the Amy in the book does, but it's easy to have seen these consequences coming anyway. 
 Due to this I never quite liked Amy. She was fine as a protagonist and her actions moved the plot forward when the action stopped but there wasn't enough justification for all of her risk taking. It's clear what would happen but she seemed blissfully ignorant. The story does a good job of explaining her reasoning and actions so I never really disliked Amy either. She was more of a neutral narrator for me. I initially liked Baby, despite the overly articulate, overly intelligent characterization they gave to a toddler, but she disappears for most of the last 2/3rds, which is really unfortunate. 
 The writing which worked so well in the first half - and really I hate to belabor the point but I think the book would have been much stronger if it stayed within that premise alone - starts to falter a bit when the action isn't the main point. Here the stark, descriptive less prose feels too anemic and bleak to really communicate the human and philosophical element. The actions of the people in New Hope, not surprisingly, have a big impact on the world both Before and After, yet the almost simplistic writing fails to convey the gravity. Here the story needed more weight and complexity to the word choices, at least for me. It's not poorly written by any means, it's just the drama of the minimalistic prose doesn't work when the action stops. 
 Overall it's a decent book with some obvious twists. I didn't give them away but I think they're very easy to guess even early on. Amy stays in the dark and no doubt the reader is meant to learn things as she does, but she's pretty slow on the uptake so I wouldn't be surprised if most figured out the twists early. It doesn't necessarily take away from the book though and I think the key to enjoying this book, even amongst the genre, is connecting and liking Amy. I didn't feel one way or the other about her so I found In the After average. The fact that it's so quick and easy to read helps."
5,"HOW CAN YOU END A BOOK LIKE THAT?!?!?! WTH?! I am a human being; I'm not just going to forget what happened after 27 seconds! How could you do this to me?! I'd sue for crimes against humanity but he hasn't even finished the last book yet. I feel disrespected and violated and need the next book now. 
 This series (minus the first book) is incredible and highly underrated. I wonder why no ones talking about it...."
4,"I very much loved this book! It was the perfect blend of sassiness, romance, action, and fantasy for me. I loved most of the characters especially Ignifex (I have a weakness for sassy characters). My only two complaints and the reason Cruel Beauty didn't receive 5 stars from me are 1) the ending was a wee bit confusing and muddled. It didn't fit in well with the overall theme and seemed a tad bit random. It wasn't terrible just not what I'd wanted to see happen while also not being the best way to have resolved the plot in my opinion. 2) I thought the whole ""wedding night omg I'm so pure and OMG sex"" angle of the plot was waaaay overdone and a bit forced and lame. For awhile there the author seemed determined to bring it up every other page. Aside from those things however I really loved the book and I highly recommend it! It was a fun easy read with lots of beautiful descriptions and fun dialogue!!"
2,"If there were prizes for stupid narrators and stupid love triangles, this one would sweep the board. For most of this I was rolling my eyes, groaning in frustrated agony, and yelling things at the characters. In fact, I nearly tossed the book aside within the first few pages. I don't know why I kept reading. I just did. And so, this book pulled me out of a reading slump. 
 It's not a very good book. Most of it is predictable and agonizingly childish. The main character - Belly - is just a four year old trapped inside a teenagers body. I wanted to shake her to pieces. But I guess the train wrecks she create became too awful not to look away from. And you know, everyone makes mistakes. So her immaturity and foolishness aside, she was a pretty realistically dumb character. 
 Both Conrad and Jeremiah, the other two legs of the love triangle, are bland. Jeremiah is the sweet, understanding one. Too bad he's like melted ice cream. And Conrad? He's supposed to be hunky and mysterious. Aloof. A damaged soul, hiding something soft and tender inside. He made me want to punch a wall. I'd probably get through to the wall faster than him. He's like ice cream that's too cold and frozen solid. With both of them, it felt like the author was trying too hard to appeal to the audience. One boy for the readers who love them sweet. Another for the ones who like bad boys. Too bad neither had any personality that made them unique. 
 And so these are the contents of our love triangle. Oh so tragic. In all honesty, I'm biased against love triangles from the start. The indecision is horrifying in my opinion. But this one seemed worse than most. The one redeeming point of this book is probably Beck and Belly's mother. I like their friendship and how it seem to survive whatever gets thrown at them. They are true best friends forever. 
 But again, this book had too much romantic drama and goo for me. But it managed to get me out of my reading slump and that is something that matters to me. It's a good summer book. It really captures the feel of ice cream."

 Note: Due to copy an paste, formatting has been lost. 
 Have you ever read a book, or saw a movie that made you really think, that in some insane twist of fate, that this might someday be you. That little girl, getting beat on by her boyfriend? That could be me. That little girl that got raped? That could be me. By just one insane little twist of fate, that could be any of us girls. Don't fool yourselves. It could be any of us, we just like to think that it never could. 
 We like it, being safe in the knowledge that she could never be me. And we're wrong. It could be you. Think about that for a second. Just one second. Then, imagine yourself as Alex when your reading this. She had so many chances to get out of it, and she never took them. I can't tell you how many times that I thought she was going to take them, to finally dump him, and never see him again. But she didn't. We're not always as brave as we would hope to be. 
 She thought that if she changed her friends, and changed herself, she would be alright. Imagine yourself in her shoes. What would you do? You love him, this awful monster that hits you, and puts you down. But you love him. 
 This is one of those books where you heartbroken throughout, and in the end, you find a sense of peace. Just a little bit, hidden in the last pages, and it makes the entire book worth it. Every heartbreak, every slap, every time that you missed Alex's friends, is suddenly worth it. Just for that little bit of peace, there at the end. 
 I would just say that I loved it, but I didn't. Not really. I loved the realism, and every little complex detail, but how can you love an abusive relationship story? Do you get where I'm going with this? 
 Alex, I think, was truly one of the most complex characters I've come across in a long time. She's weak in heart, but she makes up for it in the spirit that she has in the end. She is strong, in her own abused way. 
 I just want to murder Cole ruthlessly. With a 2x4, preferably. He was such a....abuser. He deserved whatever he got, I assure you. I hate how I wanted to like him in the beginning, even though I knew that he was gonna hit her. I knew. 
 To be honest, this book made me sad, but the ending was so peaceful, that it made me sober up off that sadness, and it really made the book something amazing. 
 Favorite Quote: 
 But it was like watching myself from the end of a long, black tunnel. The poor girl on the other end--she was bruised, and confused, and beaten, and I felt sorry for her. Whoever she was."
4,"Rainbow Rowell is good at writing. This book was hard to put down, even though it really shouldn't have been -- a book about complicated friendships and a just-ever-so-slightly troubled marriage -- held together by a ""magical"" phone that lets the protagonist, Georgie McCool, talk to her husband in the past. 
 Somehow, Rowell makes it work. The relationships she writes about - both familial and romantic - feel so real that sometimes they hurt a little to read. She manages to capture the smallest moments in ways that make them feel like grand gestures. I'm going to stop telling you how good this book was and instead tell you just to read it, especially if you've ever loved anyone and been afraid you might lose them."
5,"Well I understand now why it won a Pulitzer Prize, Best Novel Of The 20th Century and why Harper Lee was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freed. This book is that good."
4,"Sanderson's debut doesn't reach the sheer awesomeness of his later works, but was nevertheless an enjoyable fantasy read."

 Frostbite cemented my commitment to the Vampire Academy series but I think it was Shadow Kiss that really put the books on my favorites list. When I started the books I only had the first two but soon after I started reading I ordered the new box set. Guys, I couldn't even wait the few extra days for delivery! I needed this book so bad, so off to the library I went! 
 The end of Frostbite left our Rose a changed person. She is haunted by the memory of what happened, in more ways than one, and quite literally as ghosts and shadows seem to be surrounding her. Of course this is something she keeps to herself and suffers with alone. If that wasn't bad enough, her Guardian training trials have begun and are not going as expected. 
 There was so much about this installment that I loved. Despite the difficulties surrounding Rose, she had grown so much and had become a force to be reckoned with in her world. Really getting back to the use of the elemental magic the Moroi have, especially Christian who truly shows just how badass he is with fire and Lissa returning to the use of spirit was so fun to see! It adds such a great flavor to the books and the characters. And Adrian's ability to dream walk is pretty awesome. Things really heat up between Rose and Dimitri, finally! *fans self* And omg I can't even with what happens at the end! What an emotional roller coaster! I can't say I was completely shocked. I picked up on little clues that something big was coming to change the dynamic of the series. And boy did it! I think this might be my favorite of all the books. The excitement and suspense is so killer and even with some ideas and guesses as to what may happen next, Richelle Mead starts to show her talent with throwing in a few extra surprises to keep you on your toes with this one!"
4,"notes from re-read in june 2017: yup, still my least favourite. I just don't recognize most characters, they're so out of themselves in this one. 
 this is my least favourite so far. it's amazing nevertheless but it's really different from the other three volumes, in a not-bad weird way. I'm still very excited to see where the hell this story will go!

5,"A real page turner could not put it down, I enjoy supernatural books, this was not over done though and has a great story. It is part of a trilogy though like so many I'm reading and part 2 not out till October."
1,I'm Sorry to say this but this book is terrible. I don't like the characters at all and that crazy mentioning of Japanese related stuff somehow just didn't work for me. I'm crazily in love with Japan and its entertainment world but it just felt too bothersome in here.. No offense! This just didn't do it for me :(
3,"(This review can be found on my blog The (Mis)Adventures of a Twenty-Something Year Old Girl. 
 Pretty Amy is a book that I had wanted to read for quite awhile. I was thrilled when I won a copy. However, I was disappointed when it wasn't as good as I had hoped. It's still an alright/good read though. 
 Amy is a seventeen year old high school senior. On the night of prom, Amy and her two best friends Cassie and Lila get stood up by their dates. They decide to forego prom and end up at the house where Lila's boyfriend lives. Since the boys aren't there, Lila decides to steal a big bag of marijuana from Brian as payback. After smoking some of it and joyriding around the time, the girls are pulled over by the police. They are charged with possession, intent to sell and sale. Amy is facing jail time but can get probation if she'll sign a paper saying it was all Cassie and Lila. Amy doesn't want to turn against her best friends, so does that mean she'll throw herself to the wolves? 
 The title kind of caught my eye, but after reading this book, I felt as if a better title could've been picked. Pretty Amy is what Amy's bird says throughout the book. 
 I think the cover is a good choice because it's a photo of what started this whole thing. 
 The world building is alright. I think the character of Amy makes the world building a little unbelievable, but I'll elaborate on that later. I was never a ""bad kid"" so I don't really have anything to compare Amy's world to. However, I knew some bad kids, and I imagine their lives would've been like Cassie's, Lila's and Amy's. 
 The pacing did start off a bit slow, but it definitely picked right up probably about 50 pages into the book. This is one of those books I devoured because I loved the writing style and how Burstein was able to captivate an audience. 
 I enjoyed the whole good girl turned bad plot. I found it interesting with what choices Amy had to make about her life. Amy used to be a good girl, but she felt invisible and just wanted to fit in with someone. She mixes with the wrong crowd, and before she knows it, she's smoking (cigarettes and weed), skipping classes, and getting in trouble at school. The plot deals with self discovery as a theme. 
 I had a big problem with Amy. I found her to be really, really annoying. In fact, I was going to stop reading the book because of her, but I decided to keep reading. (I'm glad I did because it was a good book). I just didn't find her to be that believable. She threw these temper tantrums that I've never known any senior in high school to throw. She acted more like a spoiled 10 year old than a 17 year old. And while I understand that she was a moody teenager whose future was uncertain, she still came across as being really young as well as annoying. However, I did relate to her with the whole feeling invisible and just plain. I felt and still feel the same way. Ultimately, I was too annoyed with her to really connect, so I found myself not caring if she want to jail. We don't really get to see much of Cassie and Lila past the first few chapters. Cassie didn't feel like a real character either because I felt like the author was trying too hard to make Cassie seem like a bad girl. I was indifferent about Lila although she felt more realistic then Cassie and Amy. Amy's mom seemed to just cry the whole time which I found annoying as well. I don't think anyone cries as much as that woman did! I did like Amy's dad though. I loved how supportive he was of Amy and how helpful he was. I also liked Joe although I wish we would've got to read a bit more about him. 
 Some of the dialogue did feel forced, especially when it involved swearing. There was so much swearing in that book, and it just felt a bit over the top. However, minus the swearing, I did enjoy some of the snarky comments by Amy the most even if some were a bit immature. 
 Overall, Pretty Amy by Lisa Burstein was enjoyable to read as strange as it may sound with how annoyed I was with Amy. I don't really know what it was, but I did like this book. I think if Amy had acted more like a 17 year old then a tween, it would've been a lot better. 
 I'd recommend this book to those aged 16+ (due to language) who are after an interesting contemporary novel. 
 I'd give Pretty Amy (Pretty Amy #1) by Lisa Burstein a 3.5 out of 5."
5,"Can everyone read this series, please? I NEED to talk to people about it."
5,"As a disclaimer I must confess that I adore all of Rachel Haimowitz's works. After reading Counterpoint on my kindle (price?!?) I bought the paperback and am now eagerly awaiting for the second book in the Song of the Fallen series to come out later this year. I found out that she had also started another series recently, the Belonging series that begins with Anchored. Having read Counterpoint I knew that Himowitz was not for everyone. There are `rapes' in the sense that while the characters may want it on some level, it's still being forced. She writes about slaves and masters falling in love, about hostages and princes setting aside their differences, she's very real when she writes, and for those who enjoy escaping from the real world and always having a HEA or at least 100% likable characters, you might not enjoy her. 
 Anchored of course also had to have a hard plot. The story revolves around a world in which slavery is the norm, think alternate universe. But it's not slavery as we think of it, the slaves are like second class citizens though still holding jobs and what not, they are just at the mercy of their master. Daniel is one such slave, he is a news anchor, though you wouldn't be able to tell what he's really like by that, on camera and off are two separate things. Carl on the other hand is a free man, though a sort of competitor to Daniel's anchor personality. Carl becomes the new owner of Daniel, and it's here the story really presents itself. Carl is mostly kind, yet yes there is a scene in which he is brutal. I'm not saying it's ok or even saying that I enjoyed it, but it was necessary to his character and world. In his world there are slaves and there are masters. It's hard to think of your slave as a full person and equal when he isn't. Yet I think he also grows, as does Daniel. 
 The thing is, I don't think Carl was supposed to be likable. He's a master in this world, our feelings and hope lie with Daniel. That's what I love about the author though, her characters are real, we hate them, then we just dislike them, by the end of the book or series will we love them? Maybe, maybe not completely, but that's perfect in its own way. By the way this is only book one, she has a short story featuring Daniel being released in July, and there may be more full length one on the way, though her website warns that it won't be happy... even by her standards (which is saying something). Even still I can't help but to love her, her worlds and her characters. It's not easy creating worlds so intricate and painful. While I do like the occasional break from reality with good guys always being good and bad guys being beat, I really, really adore the dirty real novels as well. FYI Oct 2011 is supposedly when Crescendo (Book II of Song of the Fallen) comes out! 
 ----Boo now Crescendo is November!----- 
 **Also on Amazon"
4,"Like many people, I suppose, I found out about this one when the movie came out. Unlike many people, I generally insist on reading the book before I see the movie (so long as I know it's a book first). Krakauer gives a very fair account of this head-strong, well-meaning but ultimately naive young man. He addresses both the fascination and scrutiny surrounding the life of McCandless giving it an honesty I really appreciated. I feel as if, had I read this a few years ago when I was as similarly head-strong like McCandless, it would have totally changed my world. It reflects aspects of my life and the lives of many people I have known over the years. Now, I can just appreciate it as a tale reflecting the journey and disappointment of idealism in so many young people. And I'm glad I read it first--it's so personal, it should be experienced on the page. Now off to the movie...."
4,Zuse is still the best thing about this series.
4,"This was fantastic! Loved it! The first half of this book I listened to on Youtube, I was super busy had to make all the food and 3 different cakes for a party and thought lets give this one a whirl. My experience with Neil Gaiman audiobooks read by Neil himself are that they feel a little dry, slow and a bit 
 and I have shit to do, so I listened to this it is a playlist of Neil reading live at different events and he was fantastic in this setting he was funny and engaging, he had the crowd laughing it was just a bit more lively then the few Gaiman studio audiobooks I have listened to. 
 The story is of a baby whose family is murdered and he ends up in a graveyard and is raised by the ghosts who live there. The couple who take him in, the Owens decide on the name ""Nobody"" as the everyone says he looks like somebody and Mrs.Owens says he looks like nobody. So it is settled Nobody Owens or ""Bod"" as he is called will live in the graveyard until he is an adult. Adventures, misunderstandings and dangers abound all around young Bod in the graveyard. It was sweet and at times a bit dark. But all together quite enjoyable 
 But the ending... 
 I get that it was supposed to be happy but as a mom myself I was just a little sad 
 But apparently I am a bit emotional at the best of times"
4,"I ended up liking this book overall. I wasn't blown away by it, but it was definitely enjoyable and relatable and I think it makes an excellent children's book. That being said, as an adult, it was a bit difficult to look past its trope-iness. I found the characters to have pretty much zero personality other than the tropes they fit into, which made it difficult to feel invested in their problems at times. 
 However, I did find the story to be a lot more likable as it progressed. I liked the way everything fit together so perfectly at the end. It was very neat, leaving no loose ends. The metaphor and symbolism of the plot also becomes more and more apparent as the story goes on. I also liked the writing style, which to me felt a little bit reminiscent of other children's authors I've liked before (as in, Oliver's writing style was unoriginal, but in an enjoyable way, if that makes sense). 
 I would recommend giving this book a try if you're interested in reading it. Most people seem to adore it. Although I can't say I thought it was amazing, I can see why others might think so. 
 For me this is somewhere between a 3 and 4 star read...but I'll bump it up to 4 stars just to be nice, haha."
5,"Come by my blog, Forever Lost in Books, for MORE reviews, giveaways, interviews and memes! 
 My Opinion : This book by Carol Lynch Williams was great. I enjoyed reading it a lot. I couldn't stop thinking about it. I loved and still love it! 
 Characters : Kyra had a great personality. She was 13 years old and faced with a wedding with her uncle. Ugh! I loved her a lot. Her perspective was mature considering that she's 13 years old. 
 Laura was a good friend to Kyra. 
 Joshua was her 'boyfriend' or something like that. He was sweet, but I hated that he didn't come back for Kyra! 
 There were other characters, but I don't see why I should elaborate."
3,"This book has a lot of potential, it really does! I'm a huge sucker for fantasy!This world and mythology and everthing is well thought out, the characters are funny and real! It made me laugh, and I really cared for everyone involved. 
 And still it only deserves a 3. In the end, not much happens, at all... The first two hundred pages or so are just a journey where nothing especially exciting happens. They ride, eat, ride, take a break, ride, eat, sleep, and repeat! I realize we got to know everyone and how the world works, but... Meh, you still could have summerized those two hundred pages to about fifty, and I don't think the book would have suffered from it at all! 
 Sure, there was a twist at the end I didn't see coming, but unfortunately it made me like Gen, the main character, a little less actually, and I don't think that was the intention. 
 A good book with potential, but nothing more. I have high hopes for its sequels though; they're on their way to me as I write."
0,"DNF @ 50% 
 There just seems to be a lot of back and forth drama involving other people, and I'm not feeling it :/ 
 But I will try again with the next in the series!"
3,"I like the first book. Just liked. It wasn't mind blowing or incredibly creepy. It was exaggeratedly descriptive in a beautiful way (which meant that I was constantly re-reading paragraphs). 
 Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children was interesting enough that I read it fairly fast and then passed it on to my friends and family who enjoyed it very much. 
 And now we're here, Hollow City. And this one, I adored just enough that I plowed through it. I took in every beautiful description like it was the last book I'd ever read. I fled right along with our peculiar friends and met many new (more interesting ones tbh) along the way. 
 Hollow City starts out very slow. Nothing much happens and I was afraid I'd be back in the same boat I was with the first one. But, it soon picks up and we're traveling through time! Literally. Away from the ruins of their beloved lighthouse on the island. 
 And so much happens, but it all happens very quickly. And there is almost too much to take in. 
 Peter-and-Joel. The only reason you'll need to read this book. They're my favorite adorably peculiar boys! 
 I could really do without the ""romance"" between Jacob and Emma. It seems to be adding nothing to the story. 
 If you can take in all the back story and keep up with every little thing that is going on in these books, it really is an interesting and magical thing. 
 End note: I'm ready for the movie. I can't see it being anything more than amazing."
5,"It was amazing. Typical Rick Riordan. 
 I didn't for a second doubted that this book wouldn't be just as awesome like every one of Mr. Riordan's book. What can I say about his writing? About his witty humor? About his exemplary plot twists and his super-fun, adorable, heroic, courageous, brave demi-gods? 
 The POVs were amazing. I especially loved Reyna and Leo's but I loved the rest too. What I wanted, was at least one or two Percy &/or Annabeth POVs so that I could see what these two would do next and of course we learned through Nico's POV but it's just not the same. I just wish I had gotten to feel how they feel and see them kiss through their eyes. These two are the epitome of 'cutest couple on earth'. But something tells me, Rick didn't do just that because we might actually see even more of them. Yes, yes. Gimme more. 
 What I love about Rick's stories is that they never feel dragged, not for one second. He's written 10 books based on Greek mythology and later on Greek/Roman and all ten of them have Percy & Annabeth, of course there are new characters too, but what I'm trying to say is that his characters are so amazing and they evolve all the time to these amazing human-beings (or rather demi-gods) and his stories are so adventurous that you never get bored. Never. 
 Well, next is a new series based on Norse mythology. That is going to be perfect. I already know it. First and foremost, this Magnus Chase guy has the same last name as Annabeth. Something tells me he is a distant relative of hers. Yas! Bring it on Rick!"
3,"I have had this addition to the Legend trilogy on my list since reading and immensely enjoying the series late last year. I must say that I was a little disappointed. Life Before Legend is a collection of two short stories set a few years prior to the events taking place in the main trilogy. One story is from the perspective of Day, and one from June. It didn't add much to my knowledge and love of the series and I can't say I found the plot hugely intriguing in either tale. It was, however, interesting to be given a broader insight into characters in differing positions in the social hierarchy, and to see how the events played out in this dystopian world have affected them."

4,"As soon as I realized I was in dire need of a high fantasy novel, I stumbled upon this book on my TBR list and downloaded it onto my Kindle then and there. Even before I began reading it, I knew 'Touch of Power' would be perfect, because 1) it's written by Maria V. Snyder, and I absolutely LOVED 'Poison Study', and 2) because I was definitely in the mood for everything the synopsis offered. Then I started reading the book, and page by page, I grew more and more in love with the book. 
 One of the things I loved most about the novel was the one-of-a-kind heroine, Avry. Besides the fact that she is the only healer left in all of the 15 realms, she's also the type of person to make all the wrong assumptions about her ""enigmatic captor-protector"", and everyone knows that incorrect assumptions make for the best romances! I also adored the girl because she was crazy selfless, sickening herself over and over again - oftentimes to the brink of death - to save several of her ""kidnappers"". She also got on Kerrick's nerves all the times, and those scenes were always the best (Kerrick just so happens to be the captor-protector discussed earlier). 
 The world-building was just right - there wasn't too much information or too little - and each character's personality stayed consistent throughout the novel. Also, the ending was a surprise. I figured that eventually Avry would agree to heal Ryne, but as to how she would heal herself/get healed, I had no clue. Well, that's a lie. I had plenty of ideas, but none of them turned out to be true. One of my ideas was actually that sex with Kerrick would heal Avry. Crazy, I know, but a similar thing happened in 'Grave Mercy' so I figured it could happen again. In truth, it's nice to not be able to guess everything once in a while, so I guess that's another point in the novel's favor. 
 And that's pretty much all there is to say about this book. It's your standard - but highly enjoyable - high fantasy novel. It met all my expectations, and I couldn't stopped reading it (and trust me, I tried). I grew very attached to the characters throughout the novel, and was plain disgusted by Tohon, the evil dictator-like man. Overall, 'Touch of Power' is a great start to the Healer series, and I'd recommend it to fans of high fantasy, magic, and romance. I really enjoyed the novel, but when taking a step back from my emotional self, I don't think it's very memorable. I don't think it really stands out."
5,"I finished the book and immediately began rereading it. I don't know if I've ever done that with a book. Well written, beautiful, full of internal changes without annoying characters. 
 Maddy is a 17, and early on turns 18. She has SCIDS making it impossible for her to leave her house. One day out the window she see Olly, a boy in a family with an abusive father. They begin communicating and Maddy's nurse Carla eventually allows him in the house for non touching visits. Except they touch accidentally, and Maddy doesn't get sick. They get bolder and bolder and Maddy eventually decides she'd rather die living than live dying. She books a trip to Hawaii with Olly and ""runs away"" In Hawaii she swims, goes to the beach, makes love and dies. (view spoiler)[ Olly rushes her to the hospital and they give her an adrenaline shot. She survives and her mom takes her home AMA to recover. Maddy stops seeing Olly who is persistent in wanting her. Maddy receives a note from the doctor that treated her in the hospital telling her she does not in fact have SCIDs and probably got sick because she has never been exposed to any germs. She works to rebuild her identity, relationship with her mom, and eventually Olly. (hide spoiler)] 
 This book was truly amazing. The characters were so demential I actually missed Maddy when it was over. Beautifully done."

 Fans of Violetta Rand will enjoy this new series in the MC world. Lily Gallo has a thing for bad boys, but due to some bad choices in her past, she is on the straight and narrow path - with new beginnings in Philadelphia as a high school counselor she wants to start off on the right foot. That lasts as long as it takes for her to meet Lang Anderson of the Sons of Odin MC. She almost succumbs to his charms at a bar but the next Monday was even more shocked when she found out he was raising his three younger sisters by himself...and she was counseling the oldest girl. 
 Lang is hot, and the sexy MC alpha vibe we love to see is here. I love a heroine with common sense, and Lily Gallo is no fool. Plenty of sexy times and passionate encounters here!"
3,"Jandy Nelson has an interesting writing style, but that ending was completely predictable. I still enjoyed this book."
4,"My favorite ongoing UF series. Just, yes please, give me moaaar! I love Gin and her story so much. This one gave us a lot of background on Sophia and we finally see how truly brave this woman is. It pained me to hear what she has gone through, but luckily she has her sister, Gin & co to support her. Always and forever, this gang! Heart of Venom introduces us to horrible villains (and in the best possible way) since these people were creepy, cruel and shudder-worthy. It was good to see Gin kick some butt again! Oh, and I wholeheartedly approve the Owen-redemption storyline, because that's a ship I'm willing to sail on to the very end and it better be all good by the time we're done with the series. Also, Lauren Fortgang is an audiobook goddess! That woman brings everything to life and never disappoints. Can't wait to pick up the next one!"

 Short summary of this book: GAT, AMBITION AND STRONG COFFEE, once upon a time there was a king with three daughters, migraines are the worst and my mom should stop hovering and she's so over protective. Oh and I killed my friends because I was an idiot and I also hallucinate a lot."

 BOOK THREE (IGNITE ME): 
 This book disappointed in regards to Warner...but only momentarily. So it turns our favourite physcopath is actually a misunderstood anti-hero. How annoying is that? The things that had set him out as cold and murderous, is actually explained away as him having a stimulation chamber, to mimic that toddler in danger (which I didn't mind), but then he does a double whammy and says the reason he executed another solider point-blank, was because he was a drunk and beat up his kids and wife! Textbook reasoning 101. I shit you not. Now, Warner's being presented as some merciful mercenary who's working for the greater good (but the author tells us, not really, it's his own interests) and does bad things to achieve it. It was a bit much to swallow. What is this, trope after trope being shoved down my throat? Why can't a bad boy (who's turning into a romantic interest)...not keep that little bit of crazy and insaneness wrapped around him, instead of it being explained away? 
 However, the author does well not to make Juliete and Warner fall immediately into each others arms. At this point, Adam's so far out the picture, I felt desperately sorry for the guy (the MC broke up with him in book 2) and when he re-emerges in this book it's with a lot of anger and hatred towards the MC...which is a little off-putting and makes me miss Adam from book one. I understand where he's coming from though...and there's a chance he's falling for another female, Alis, towards the end....but I was disappointed his character had been sacraficed, in order for Warner to shine and be more appealing. I see what the author was doing - and it worked! Because in regards to Warner....jeez, it was like the first book didn't happen at all. All the mean things attributed to him, have been explained away, we know the sob story about his mum and now we're left with this guy opening up his heart and soul...and how can you resist that? Despite the out-of-character explanations of his motives in the beginning of this book, the rest of the book, backed it up by presenting this lovely man, tormented and damaged by his past, and how he cares deeply for Juliette and little for everyone else. But even that too, slowly changes...when he finds out Adam and James (Adam's little bro) are his long-lost half brothers, he embraces them emotionally at once. 
 So because the rest of the book backed him up as a misunderstood guy, I grew enchanted with Warner's character again. 
 The writing in this book was also much better, than book 1 and 2, though I probably prefer book 2 the best. And all those flagrant, OTT descriptions did make the kissing scenes different and I appreciated every one. The romance...although not the best love triangle presented in the whole wide world due to execution of writing, and kind of dropping Adam's character of a cliff, just to make room for Warner...it still managed to make me feel an intensity and passion, which I wasn't expecting. 
 Overall rating for the series? No-brainer. 4/5. 
 In-between 3/5 for the writing, and 5/5 for execution of characters and plot. I will definitely look out for this writer again, because you can only improve, right? And although I wish she'd written this series a couple of years later, with those improvements in force, I'm glad she did it now. Because the flaws, the things I didn't like...maybe I'm scared if she'd written this as a more experienced writer, the polishing would've ruined the mood and setting of the piece. 
 Great series. One of the best YA series I've read in a while! God, I'm sucker for these love triangles and they're notoriously hard to write good. TEAM WARNER."
5,"Full Review on Imperfectwomen.com 
 You know how sometimes, when you've read the first book in a series, and then you've waited forever for the second book to be released and you have all your fingers and toes crossed because you hope, hope, hope that book two will be just as good as book one? That's what I've been doing since July, waiting for Infinite Possibilities to come out. Would Liam be just as bossy-hot as he was in the first book? And what about the cliffhanger we were left with? Is Liam really the bad guy? And poor Amy, is that girl going to catch a freaking break? Let me tell you, waiting the last few months was hard, but it was well worth it! Liam is still sex-on-a-stick and bossy-hot, while Amy is still trying to figure out her crazy life. I am totally in love with this series! 
 ""Raw and honest. That is what Liam Stone claimed he wanted from me, but that is not what he gave me."" 
 Infinite Possibilities starts off right where Escaping Reality left off, Amy thinks Liam is the bad guy and she runs, trying to escape him. Amy is a resourceful girl and manages to ditch Liam for a bit, but come on, like a uber-rich guy of Liam's status isn't going to be able to find her eventually. But if Liam is able to find her, that's means others can track her down too. Amy reminded of a caged animal during this book. When she felt cornered I pictured her wide-eyed and ready to bolt. Her decisions weren't always the best because she was in survival mode. Her memory is slowly, and quite dramatically, making a comeback - giving her hints and glimpses into her past but the flashbacks are taking a toll on her mental and physical health. The whole time Amy is trying to figure out what or who she's truly running from, she's also trying to figure out what her future with Liam is going to be. Can she trust him? Is he a part of what's happening to her now? Is he in danger for helping her? 
 ""I swear to you, woman,"" Liam vows, tearing his mouth from mine, framing my face with his hands, ""from this point on, I'm going to keep you naked and in bed with me where I know you're safe."" 
 Liam. Oh Liam. I like Liam. I like Liam a whole, whole lot. He is sexy. He is determined. I believe he loves Amy deeply. He's so protective of her, it borders on being possessive but he never takes it to the scary, psychotic place, thank goodness. We get to know Liam better throughout Infinite Possibilities; his devotion to Amy is real and he will do whatever it takes to keep her safe. The love scenes in this book were kicked up a notch, reaching some pretty erotic heights... Let's just say Liam knows how to please his lady...over, and over, and over again... Have I mentioned that I really like Liam? 
 While Amy is having her flashbacks and Liam is trying to figure out how to keep Amy safe, the reader is left wondering... who is chasing Amy? What the heck is going to happen to her? 
 About three quarters of the way through the book, I had my ""HOLY CRAP I think I've figured it out!"" moment. I was pretty excited because if I was right, that was going to be quite the twist! I wasn't exactly sure HOW it was going to happen... but I can now say that I was mostly right. At least I think I was... Why don't I know for sure? Because she left us kinda, sorta, hanging again! It wasn't as bad as the first book, but there's no way you're not going to want to know what's next. By the end of the book, we have a good idea of what Amy and Liam are up against, we know where Amy and Liam's relationship stands, and we are given a new character to focus on... 
 ""Someone buried me alive. The finality of all that once was and can never be again. There is nothing left. Nothing."" 
 This book was really intense. I felt like I was a passenger on the Lisa Renee Jones rollercoaster of Romantic Suspense novels. I think she plotted to torture us with the mini-cliffhangers she left at the end of each chapter. I would tell myself, just one more chapter, and then I would get to the end and there was no way I couldn't not know what was going to happen next! I had a few, totally worth it, sleepless night's thanks to them. There's a third book in the series, Forsaken, which is due out in 2014. I'm counting down the days until I'm reunited with my Liam. 
 My rating: 5 suspenseful and erotic stars!"
3,"A cute little story for those who enjoy knitting! It's fun to see Kelly learn how. A pattern and recipe is included at the end too. The mystery is intriguing, but the book is as much about a circle of knitting friends and their community, which is a nice touch. Enjoyable read!"
4,"Somewhere between 3/5 and 4/5, but it more often hit the 4's than it did the 3's. The magic system is total nonsense, but tries to pretend otherwise, that's fine I guess. The world building feels off, too much hipster, SanFran culture for my tastes. And it feels a bit out of place. For something 'set' in the future is feels too modern culturally. The scene transitions feel extremely abrupt at times. Sometimes it reads a bit more like a good fanfic than it does a professional novel. The characters are the best part of this book, and they are very well done, even if the dialogue is sometimes a bit unnatural."
2,"A bunch of old time jargon compacted into a novel...And not the good kind either... 
 Quotes from Queenpin that I wanted to burn: 
 ""She knew everybody and everybody knew her and she plucked me out of that two-bit hootchy-kootch and put me on a big stage, footlights up my dress (p.6) 
 """"I wanted to take it in, her whole set up. The half moon manicured nails, pale green suit and hat, the pearl-ring brooch. Class. No gun moll, she. (p.7) 
 ""Sure, I left feeling like I'd won something big, slid out from some clutches, but that feeling was long gone by the time I'd driven back to her place, our place. I'd beaten one rap for the time being, but I was headed back to a different kind of stir (p.154) 
 Yay, can someone hand me a box of matches now? The whole book is written like this,if it was a few sentences I could take it but....No... It wasn't. It was my whole dang book. Like let's stuff as much old time talk as we can into one paragraph.Yup, you can say it,I got lost in the style and but lost I don't mean I loved it. I mean I got confused like someone spun me on a road like a top and asked me to read out loud. The narration, darn that narration...It seemed so gimmicky. 
 I've read better portrayals of this year so I was let down.The plot, oh hell I don't remember if there ever was one. I was to busy trying to sort out her awful slang. I remember betrayal, the book isn't terrible, it's just not good and if you watch a lot of 40s movies like I do you will see that she used a lot of cliche scenes. The font was so huge, it made the book seem childish. 
 It didn't suck, no...I read it.Just a meh, not the greatest book, I've ever read. Not the worse."
3,"It was interesting at first, but the stress on the romance just made it boring for me.... couldn't finish"
5,"First read October 12-13, 2015"
4,"This is the second Peter Pan retelling I've read. The first was The Child Thief by Brom - the darkest book I have ever read in my life. This one, in comparison, is much more mellow, although still dark. The story is told from the point of view of Tinker bell. When I first heard this, I remember thinking that Tink would be the protagonist, but that's not the case at all. Tinker bell is more like an omnipresent narrator. The story centers around Tiger Lily. 
 ""Let me tell you something straight off. This is a love story, but not like any you've heard. The boy and the girl are far from innocent. Dear lives are lost. And good doesn't win. In some places, there is something ultimately good about endings. In Neverland, that is not the case."" -Tinker Bell 
 * I loved Tiger Lily as the protagonist. She's unlike any other main character I've encountered; she's completely independent and strong-minded, she has a sort of quite strength that you can't help but admire. She refuses to fit into any type of role or expectation the people of her village set upon her, and this leads her to becoming a sort of outcast. Tiger Lily isn't completely alone as she has her adoptive father, Tik Tok and the small, often-bullied Pine Sap -her only friend- (these two are other characters I absolutely adored) but she often feels lonely and out of place. And that's how she gravitates toward Peter Pan...they are both wild and a bit untameable, they're also both fearless and immensely skilled. They are a match for each other. I loved the way he was depicted in this book; how he was fickle-minded and absent at times, how captivating and charming he is, as well as how dark and twisted he can be. 
 *This story is a sort of prequel to the Peter Pan story we all know, so we get to see the relationship between Tiger Lily and the lost boys grow and develop into something deeper, we get to see her and Peter form a sort of bond, we get to experience all her heartbreaks and delights. All through Tinker Bell's eyes. 
 *The book is atmospheric and every bit as magical and mysterious as you would expect Neverland to be. Hook and his crew of pirates are a part of this story as well. Hook is depicted as a sad, old man whose life has been consumed by his obsession of youth and immortality. There isn't an all-evil villain in this story; the characters are very complex and even the main characters are morally gray, which I enjoyed. 
 *Throughout the story, there is a sort of melancholy and forlorn feel. Maybe it's because the story is being told from Tink's point of view...Tinker Bell is mute (as fairies are mute in this world) and she is ignored like all the time, she's almost invisible to everyone. And since she cares so much about Tiger Lily and the boys, it was heart-breaking to witness her longing for attention and acknowledgment. She observes everything and knows so much about those around her, but she is unable to warn or confront the ones she cares about, she is also unable to experience the things that they have that she longs for. My heart really broke for her. On the bright side, though, I loved her relationship with Tiger Lily. They don't talk to each other and Tiger Lily doesn't acknowledge Tink, but you can feel how much they care about each other regardless. Even Tink's relationship with Peter was cute to witness. He doesn't give her much attention as he is very flighty, but the few times he does are gold. Also, I have a feeling Peter understands her more than anyone else. 
 *One of the things I greatly enjoyed about this book was the message of being yourself no matter the opposition you face. Tiger Lily is obviously an example of that, but so is her adoptive father. Tik Tok is one of the most lovable characters in this book; he is caring and so gentle, his relationship with his daughter, Tiger Lily, is heart-warming. Although not explicitly stated, he is ""Two Spirit"": a culturally exclusive term used by Indigenous North Americans to describe individuals who fulfill gender roles that of both males and females. The subject of self acceptance and it's effect on happiness is largely explored through him. There are also other elements explored that made this a solid read for me. For example, at some point, white settlers appear and disrupt the religion and beliefs of Tiger Lily's people, which reflects the historically correct instances where Native American culture (and other cultures) were disrupted by western culture. 
 This was an amazing book that destroyed me in so many ways but somehow left me hopeful by the end. I teared up towards the end (and you probably will, too). Overall, if you don't mind dark elements in your book, then you should go ahead and read it!

2,"2.0/5.0 stars 
 Too long. 
 Too sciencey. 
 Awesome premise. 
 At the end, I can look back and say it was an interesting and compelling story as a whole. In the middle, though, I seriously wasn't sure I could stick with it. 
 I found the ending pretty unsatisfying. I mean by that point, what harm would there have been in another 100 pages to give some better closure for all that buildup? Sheesh."
3,"I finished this three days ago and normally I get reviews right up, but I've been struggling with how to review it. On the plus side, it has the crazy action of Max Barry or Matt Ruff, with a fun sardonic wit and great pacing. Also, snaps to Shafer for having one of his main characters be a Persian female. Nice to see that kind of diversity in this and it didn't feel forced. 
 But...I could not stand the other two main characters. And since the POV rotates around the three of these folks, you spend a lot of time with them. One is a drug addict with a tenuous hold on reality. The other is a lush who makes up bullshit self-help stuff, much of which he stole from the drug addict's stories/life (they were college roommates). So, it's really hard to care about either of these two or how their stories will eventually end up with each other or the woman. 
 Then there is a romance inserted. A romance that does not work. At all. Probably for me it failed because I would run like hell from either of these guys, not dance into the arms of the nearest person with impulse control. But also there was zero chemistry. You can't just write in a romance, you have to build some attraction in and I never felt that happened. 
 The book doesn't end; it just stops, if that makes sense. Like when the Matrix II stopped and you were all ""Wait, what?"" I hope he's just leaving it ambiguous (it's the journey, not the destination kind of thing) rather than leaving it hanging for a second book. This really should end where it did, because ultimately for these characters it is the journey. Although, I'm done with that journey and don't want to ride along with them for more, so a sequel would be something I'd avoid."
1,"This book is soooo cheesy. The author reminds you repeatedly of things that happened in Pride and Prejudice and explains things TOO much. Also, Elizabeth never gets a moment alone with her husband- and James tells us that like 4 times. Sometimes the characters think or say a thing right after the narrator tells you. There are some aspects of modern relationship dynamics that have been placed upon these characters shoulders that is inauthentic, especially Elizabeth. Also, it's not much of a murder mystery. the way it's set up you know who did it AND why. Please don't introduce characters that you don't tell us more about until the end, because they are OBVIOUSLY those that stuff is going to happen to. I'm pushing myself to finish it. Also ""such a hard time"" is repeated several times. show us, don't tell us. There are two almost equal confessions, that are very drawn out. These could have both been shortened, and then in the epilogue we get a rehashing of Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship developments from P&P. gag me."
3,"I won't deny that the writing is fabulous, but I never connected with the story anymore then as a means to explore the beautiful imagery. The plot was slow, there was very little action, and there wasn't much in terms of true character moments. It was captivating while I was reading it but it didn't feel as though it were constructed from a solid foundation."
3,"This book was good, and kept my attention with plenty of suspenseful moments, but its not my favorite Alastair Reynolds book. 
 This is both a science fiction and mystery book. It was very interesting, but I felt it took a little while to get going. But once it did, the pages flew by. Reynolds is one of my favorite authors, and I'm always looking forward to the next book of his sitting on my shelf. Having read so many of his other books, which I liked better than this one, is the only reason my rating wasn't higher."
4,"I definitely liked this book more than the first one, maybe because it seemed less... frivolous? than the first. And when I say frivolous I mean the whole spy sneaks off campus to meet a boy and then they don't actually end up together and it's all a bit pointless even if it is entertaining thing. This book was more interesting to me and I'm glad I decided to carry on with the series, I hope I enjoy the rest of it as much as I did this book."
4,"It was a pretty good read. 
 Reminded me a lot about Lord of the Flies"
3,"Ms. Andrews succeeds in starting a new urban/fantasy series with excitement and promise! I am amazed at how intricate and involved her knowledge of the world she is creating is. So many new species, so much background, so much understanding! It boggles the mind (and threatens to totally confuse the reader if one is not paying very close attention.) Since this is the beginning of a series, I can understand, although I think she did overdue it a bit all at once. While it all ties in, it is hard to keep track of while trying to follow the plot. 
 I've also realized that I am one who believes that for a book to be really good, it must contain a love relationship of some sort. While that relationship does not need to be the focus of the story, it does need to be at least a strong thread that runs through the story. If for no other reason, it keeps the readers interest and breaks up the monotony that threatens to make a story one dimensional, in this case the constant war against various monsters. I thoroughly enjoyed the fights but when there is little else going on, it can easily become redundant. 
 Still, the writing is so creative and the heroine is so fresh and fun to read, I will withhold judgement until I have devoured at least the second book. With a little romance this could be a 5 star winner!"
3,"I usually love Teresa Mummert's books, in fact there has not been one that I haven't loved until now. It is with great sadness and regret that I give Safe Word 3 stars. I actually even think that may be me being generous because I am hating what I am doing right now. The teasers may have built this book up too much in my mind because I was not as crazy excited during any point of the book as I was during some of those teasers. When I started this book I didn't know very much about the plot and the teasers and synopsis where vague. After reading it I still don't feel like I know very much about it and I surely couldn't pick a genre to classify this book. I was trying to describe it to someone and I got halfway through my spiel and said ""I don't really know but I think you can tell I didn't really care!"" That fact pains me to say because of how much I enjoy this author. But I also know that you cannot please everyone with your writing so I will still love her! 
 Now down to the part y'all have been waiting for, the book. Like I said above it is really hard to classify and it has many qualities people will love. I like to start with good, quickly describe the bad and reiterate the good! I think Teresa is amazing at sex scenes and sexual tension and she just out did herself with this story. The book is as good as the teasers promise in this aspect. The ending will leave you screaming ""did that really just happen"" or ""is she really going to end it this way"" both of these statements were expelled from my mouth earlier today. The ending really shocked me, never once during this book did I even think that was a possibility. The story line itself was good. Mild spoiler (view spoiler)[Guy kidnaps girls to hold for ransom and kidnaps his high school girlfriend who broke his heart and who he thought was dead but has been living under a different name. (hide spoiler)] Another thing I have been loving lately is male POVs and this is another. 
 However, here's the deal... I loved the steamy scenes but I didn't ever have much love or even interest in the characters. The plot jumps around a lot and there are so many characters that are necessary but it just made it too much. I never got to know Rose, we see her from Cole's POV but I honestly didn't feel like we got much about her. We don't get much at all for that matter as far as details are concerned but the details are required to build a world readers care about. I honestly didn't see that she loved him at all, in high school it felt like she was using him and then she never went back to find him after high school. I don't think she loved him. Even in the present tense, spoiler alert (view spoiler)[ she tries to find his gun but still pulls a knife on him, even with what he did if she had loved him all this time she wouldn't have done that (hide spoiler)]it wasn't convincing. Maybe that is the biggest reason I didn't enjoy this book. I liked the male lead enough, he was a dirty talking bad boy, I would let him kidnap me. I even bought all the crap we were told about why he went to the dark side. There was way too much going on during this book, I am having trouble figuring out how to put it in here. There is another girl that gets thrown into the mix that wasn't necessary, it just added to the mass of info we needed as back story. With all my ranting about too much there wasn't enough of the right back story. We needed more for character development, I honestly am not sure this would have changed the outcome. I think the best way would have been to do dual POVs so we could bond with rose and get her side. The last thing that killed me was the ending, I had just suffered through reading this book and I was shocked at the last page of the last chapter. Completely flabbergasted! Then you turn the page and you have an epilogue with several new characters and I groaned. I don't want to spoil the book for those that decide to test it out but I was not satisfied with the ending. 
 The main reason I kept reading it even though I wanted to give up was just to see what would happen to the characters. The sex scenes help keep you distracted from the crazy plot and there are oh so many and they are pretty good. All in all that was what kept me reading this book. It's not terrible but it's not on the level Teresa's books usually are hence my disappointment. You should try this book if you love a good sex scene and books with crazy endings!"
3,"Divergent was a quick read and I was able to keep with it. I would rate it as a good pick for anyone who just wants to pick up a book to while away the time. I liked it well enough, but it didn't live up to the hype in my eyes. Every publisher seems to be looking for the next Hunger Games and snapping up dystopian novels left and right. The problem however is that they are racing to find the next Hunger Games and not bothering to question why HG is so widely popular. The short answer is good plot, but exceptional characters. Divergent is the book that had the potential to make it to this level, but no one slowed down to actually assess it as just a book, as opposed to the next big dystopian novel. 
 The idea behind Divergent is interesting. A futuristic society that is separated into different factions based upon personality traits and follows different ideals. Beatrix Prior is a member of the selfless Abnegation, but when she has the opportunity to switch factions, she decides to become one of the fearless Dauntless. However there is something different about Tris, she's not just Dauntless, she's a Divergent. Divergents display tributes of all the factions and this is considered dangerous. Tris must complete her Dauntless trials without giving herself away. 
 Sounds interesting, except the world has so many little holes in its development its distracting. Roth never gives a good explanation as to the split between factions, how/why/when they were first developed or why being Divergent is so dangerous. Why do these factions rarely interact? She spends a lot of time focusing on Tris' time in the Dauntless compound and her trials, but never really gives a solid foundation to the world she's created. I could ignore the lack of world building if the characters and their interactions were strong enough, but they fall a little flat. Tris is a very basic heroine, fairly forgettable and lacks depth. I found Four more intriguing and likeable, but nothing extraodinary. The main villains are mostly absent from the story, making token appearances, where as average bullies are more present in the novel. The villains & bullies who do show up are the generic, team evil types, showing no more depth than a piece of bread. 
 Divergent has some great potential, but it shows that its a first novel. I'm hoping with time & experience Roth will hone her craft and the sequels will improve my opinion."
1,"Honestly, I've read better smut scenes, more stimulating, more sensual smut scenes. And there were other things that bothered me about this book. I just forgot. I guess that's what this book is. It's not that memorable. I just didn't feel this book, you know? I just didn't connect with it very well. 
 I agree with this review. It was very similar to Fifty Shades of Grey. It basically has the same plot, same characters. The way Disastrous was written was better than the way Fifty Shades of Grey was written, though, grammatical errors aside."
5,"This is my favorite Georgette Heyer book I think. Without a silly male lead character the slang isn't as impenetrable as some of her other books (Cotillion comes to mind), and the romance is sweet, engaging, and somewhat believable."
4,"Here begins the Agni & Soma arc of Kuroshitsuji/Black Butler, which I adore. Prince Soma is absolutely adorable, especially when pestering Ciel, and Agni is pretty awesome too. However, one of my favorite parts of this volume isn't the humor (although it is good too!) but how it explores Ciel's character as a parallel to Soma's. To put it bluntly, they've both been through some shit, although Ciel has arguably had it much rougher. As I believe Sebastian points out, in another time Ciel could have grown up to be a lot like Soma if certain events in the past hadn't happened. Another great volume. Makes me wonder why no one has tried to make and sell Phantomhive-brand confections at any anime conventions, though. I can't imagine they wouldn't do well!"
5,"It deserves all five stars. It was't exactly what I expected but it was infinitely better. But the epilogue... Damn! Now I have to wait for the release of the sequel... Because there will be a sequel, right? 
 Si merita tutte e cinque le stelle. Non e esattamente quel che mi aspettavo ma e stato infinitamente meglio. L'epilogo pero... Mannaggia! Adesso dovro aspettare l'uscita del seguito... Perche c'e un seguito vero?"
5,"So many give up on this, let me express a trick: 
 This also applies to listening to the opera of Wagner, by the way, but I'll explain that later. 
 Instead of tormenting yourself trying to capture and keep in mind a fragile narrative thread as your eyes pour over, or rather have poured over them like a soft warm rain of word the many layers of description and thought that comprise Proust...Don't. There's not really that much going on that requires you to keep some fantastic cast of characters or events in mind. Just see the words, and ""listen"" to the music they make. Trust that you won't miss out, and remember the breathless quality of the prose is sort of the point. Just enjoy the colors and imagery instead of fretting over some mental abstraction you're struggling to remember. To a very large extent this book is designed to remove you from that abstraction, to wash it away from your memory, since memory and the illusion of your mental mastery of it is in fact a central idea of the work itself! If you fight that, if you refuse to allow yourself to give up the reigns to the master, you will not succeed. Proust will defeat you, and you'll give up. But you'd be giving up on yourself. Just allow the words to float past, or instead allow yourself to float past as though on a rafting trip where the banks are filled with innumerable flowers and trees of every shape and color, and all you can do is float down and try to gain some general impression, and get lost in your feelings about them. If you try to catalog every plant you see, you not only miss the point, but torture yourself and doom your endeavors to failure. 
 This is as extraordinary a work as any of the luminous praise given over the years might lead you to believe. It's also frustrating and obtuse at times. I give it 5 stars by giving it about 9 and taking away 4. 
 Oh, and Wagner? It's not Italian opera, if you look for arias and set pieces, you're going to be bored and ""lose"". Wagner the singers are advancing a plot, and the orchestra is the point. It expresses the back-story and hidden thoughts and desires of the characters. Certain themes occur when even one character thinks about a specific person, object, or even a concept. Listen for themes (motif) and listen to the glorious orchestral music, and stop focusing on the singers or the idea of an aria and you'll see why you should enjoy Wagner."
4,"4.5 stars. 
 Where do I start with reviewing this book? Well I guess the first thing to grab me was the setting, 1920's New York City. I've never read a YA book set in this time period. Actually, I think The Great Gatsby is the only other book I've read that's set in the 20's. I really enjoyed this, though. I loved all the slang and I find myself wanting to bring some of it back. 
 Secondly, I LOVED the main character, Evie. The book does alternate points of view but it's sort of like The 5th Wave, for anyone who's read that. It switches but really Evie is the main narrator/heroine, as Cassie is in the 5th Wave. Evie is mouthy, intelligent, brave, reckless, and not afraid to have a good time. She is not a goody two shoes. She kisses boys and gets drunk and doesn't feel bad about it and I love that about her. She has flaws that are believable and make you love her even more. The other narrator we get a lot from is Memphis, and I really enjoyed his chapters as well. Memphis is caring, protective, driven, and talented. He'll do anything to protect his little brother. He wants to be a famous poet. 
 I loved the concept of the Diviners also. Many characters in this book have powers. Evie can see people's memory from holding a personal object of theirs. There are healers, some can walk in dreams, summon fire, see the future, become invisible and all kinds of cool things. Can I talk about the villain of this book for a second because holy shit was he terrifying. The fact that you get to read from the murder victims points of view in the moments leading up to their completely horrifying deaths just added to how scary the villain was. It's rare a villain actually scares me but this one definitely did. There's also a really great little romance going on between Evie and(view spoiler)[ Jericho, I was thinking it might be her and Sam for a while, who I was always weary of so I was pleasantly surprised when her and Jericho started developing feelings for each other. (hide spoiler)] 
 The one thing stopping from giving this book 5 stars is that at some parts it did feel like it was dragging on and some descriptions went on too long and in too much detail, the book is already over 570 pages so sometimes it was just like ""okay, get to the point."" But it's really beautifully written and it has great characters, a really fascinating plot, an amazing villain and the end sets up for the rest of the books to be spectacular."
5,"I probably wouldn't have picked up this book if it weren't for a group I was in suggesting it. I have never read anything by this author, and to be honest I never really heard of him before this. 
 I really enjoyed this book. It started off a little slowly, and the main character John Corey was such a sarcastic SOB that he was great! I liked his style and his humor... although I'm not sure I was really supposed to like him. John is a homicide detective with the NYPD and is currently recuperating in the North Fork of Long Island from being shot three times. He is approached by the local sheriff Max to help with a double murder. John is reluctant to help, and the only reason he does help is because he knows the victims. 
 The case itself, a wife and husband are found outside their home dead. The next door neighbor insists that they came home late on their boat, but never heard the gun going off. The problem that makes this case so dangerous, the couple worked on Plum Island which contains a virus and bacteria research facility. Of course they only look at diseases that affect animals, because the US government has signed a policy stating they do not do germ warfare research. Yeah. Okay. So the feds, the CIA, the local police and whoever else has a badge, is searching to see if the couple was killed because of their job on the island. Did they steal a deadly virus that can wipe out the world, did they steal a vaccine so they could make themselves billions of dollars or is this just a case of a home burglary gone wrong. John Corey thinks he knows, and he thinks that he is the only one who can solve this case. 
 After the beginning, maybe about 20-30 pages, the book really picked up the pace and John made the book interesting. His theories were intriguing, and his humor and sarcasm kept me in touch with his character. I liked that I wasn't able to guess what was really going on, and that there were a few surprises along the way. I also liked the setting of the book and that it's in close proximity to where I live, and I have actually been to some of the places mentioned. 
 I just found out that this is the first in a series, so I'm going to look into the next book."
4,Funny. Relatable. Moving. Over way too soon.
5,"This book turned out to be more A than I thought. I've seen it stuck with the YA label so often I didn't realize it was more Older Young Adult than Young Adult. It's got some explicit situations. I didn't find them to be too terribly explicit compared to the pile of shitty bodice rippers I found in a box in the garage when I was 14 and snickered my way through but it depends on the audience, really. 
 I liked this one, I think I may have mentioned. The characters had depth and their actions felt more real than a lot of the stuff I've seen cranked out recently. Paranormal events without vampires or werewolves or the new, in thing: fairies. Yay! Not that I don't like them every now and then but I am drowning in creature of the night angst left and right. 
 Jenny doesn't really do angst. She does tired, she does lonely, she does accepting that sometimes her world is going to just be plain shitty, but not really angst. She gets up off her butt and does the things she likes and builds a world around her that comforts her and helps her family out best she can. 
 Seth is just Seth. I'm not sure how much I was into him. He was a bit more vague but I think a jock football star is just kind of going to be that way in most books. He gains some depth the more majour of a character he becomes but he doesn't turn into some sort of super awesome misunderstood genius or anything ridiculous and/or gag inducing like that. 
 Ashleigh... Oh Ashleigh. She is a shitty bitch. She's got her life of assholery planned out seemingly since birth and it's not even like she knows why, which I think is kind of true of most people who are bent on assholery on a wider scale. But she makes her slithery way pretty far up the ladder, and never mind the little people. 
 The one thing I never did figure out (view spoiler)[ is Seth's Never Around Parents - he's remarkably well adjusted for someone who's parents show up ONCE. She's not allowed over there because he's not supposed to be seeing her but they're conveniently never around so she can practically live over there every weekend. Her dad doesn't mind - he's progressive like that, or something? Uhh.. I didn't see the point in the cemetery scenes or the third floor subplot, which turned out to be just sentences on the side of the story's road, either. (hide spoiler)] 
 So, I actually did like a book as much as people said I would, for once."
4,"This really grew on me. The first few chapters left me completely confused and cranky (too many people and not enough information as to how the hell they relate!), but the second half of the book was great! 
 Loved the waffle-loving harbinger!!! Can't wait to get the second one."
4,"The typical romantic story that you can't help but love, even though it's predictable with cheesy lovey dovey dialogue. You still finish it with a big glowing smile, completely satisfied with the ending. 
 This book inspired me to book tickets to see Le Noir - The Dark Side of Cirque."
3,"3.5 stars 
 Jack is an underwater welder who works on an oil rig off the shore of Nova Scotia. His wife is 9 months pregnant. His father died when he was only 10 years old, doing a dive while drunk. While diving for work one day, something odd happens, and Jack is then distracted from anything and everyone else. 
 At first, I was a little confused and it seemed a little odd. Some of the illustrations were a bit tricky to figure out, as well, which didn't help. The illustrations got easier to read as I went, however. And I did end up liking the book. As mentioned in the introduction (by one of the producers of the tv show, Lost), it was Twilight Zone-esque, so that was kind of appealing, as well."
3,"Whoa. I won a giveaway. I never win things! And it's even my birthday! Neat. 
 Okay! Finished. Eh. I feel like this book was written as the prose version of a big budget 3D animated movie. I mean, it seriously unfolded looking like a Pixar movie in my head. That's not a bad thing or anything - I mean, it makes for cinematic reading, and I like cinematic reading - but it also, like most big budget movies, doesn't really venture outside of the status quo. I mean, of course there had to be an evil stepmother, and of course she had to be all ugly and warty (ugh, I hate the ugly evil woman trope so much), and of course everyone who opposed the heroine had to be irredeemably evil. 
 That said, it was very well written and enjoyable. Sort of a fairy tale crossed with a surreal ghost story, with highly Dickensian sensibilities. If you like that sort of thing you'll probably enjoy the book. 
 An aside: I wish the author had found some other word than ""it"" for Po. I think within the context of the story the word works, but I don't like the idea of teaching children that ""it"" is a generally appropriate way to refer a gender-ambiguous person? Meh. YMMV. 
 Requisite disclaimers, I got this book for free in a giveaway from Goodreads First Reads, it's an ARC, etc., etc."

 It was still as delicious. I think even more, because you already know more of the other characters, and you notice all these little foreshadowing details. 
 And well, melting the Man of Ice, it's just very awesome. Even though I always find the phantom fingers slightly creepy. 
 Not my favorite, but among the best in this series."

I loved it (obviously), so this review isn't gonna be interesting at all: I still love the characters, I do love Jem a lot more now, and of course Will (The end was actually heartbreaking), though Magnus is my favorite character, he is just the most interesting to me. The plot is still really good, it kept me interesting the whole book. And well I'm not ready to end this series just yet, I'm enjoying it way too much."

5,"The new Canonic Star Wars comics keep truly great! 
 I got this storyarc on its single comic book issues but I chose to make the review using this TPB edition to make a better overall review. The story is set after the events of ""Star Wars IV: A New Hope"" but before the events of ""Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back"". This TPB edition contains the issues #7-12 from the title of ""Star Wars"" in its new Marvel Canonic run. 
 Creative Team: 
 Writer: Jason Aaron 
 Illustrators: Simone Bianchi & Stuart Immonen 
 THE DIARY OF AN OLD JEDI 
 While the main storyarc is Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon, developed from the issue #8 to issue #12; however the issue #7, it's a stand-alone tale about the days of Ben Kenobi at Tatooine, keeping watch from afar of a very young Luke Skywalker. 
 Luke is able to know about this, thanks to the finding of a diary written by Kenobi with the intention of that Luke would receive it (if so, well, it could be a good idea giving it to him, back when both were at Kenobi's house, before leaving to Alderaan, since it was plain luck (not matter if Kenobi didn't believe in such things as luck) that Luke would decide to return there looking for anything useful in his Jedi training). 
 The tale is really good since it explains some things, like why the lack of training Luke since he was a kid (it's a weak explanation but at least it's logic). Also, you can appreciate how hard is for Kenobi, his radical change in his status quo. He isn't a military general anymore, but more important, he can't be a Jedi neither. He is forced to keep low profile to avoid Imperial detection, but worse, he needs to allow injustices to happen around him. 
 Obi-Wan is ""dead"" and now there is just ""Ben"", but being Jedi wasn't a job for him, it was his way of life, his faith. How to find a reason to stay alive when you can't be yourself anymore? 
 INTRODUCING MRS. SOLO 
 Han Solo and Princess Leia are looking for options of planets, for a new base, for the Rebel Alliance. They are travelling in a stolen Lambda-class Imperial shuttle, but hasty call put them in troubles and they need a place to hide. 
 Han has just the right place, but they won't be alone for much time. 
 Imperial forces are right behind them, but the really awkward is that a female bounty hunter appears,... 
 Sana... 
 ...Solo. 
 And she is claiming to be Han's wife, and ready to collect the bulged bounty that exists over Leia's head. 
 Leia's wrath easily could destroy entire planets. 
 Yep. Things aren't never easy for Han. 
 JEDI GARAGE SALE 
 Luke hoped to find something else than just a diary, sure, he values it a lot, but hardly it will helping him to make any progress in his broken Jedi training. 
 So, Luke has an idea... 
 ...a very bad idea. 
 Luke takes his X-Wing (along with R2-D2) to Nar Shaddaa, known also as ""The Smuggler's Moon"" (due ALL its inhabitants are criminal elements), asking for a discreet transport to make a travel to Coruscant, the Galactic Empire's capital world, to look for the old Jedi Temple. 
 There are two problems with, the already very bad, Luke's plan... 
 One: There isn't a Jedi Temple per se anymore, the building is the Imperial Palace now, home of our beloved Emperor Palpatine. 
 Two: Luke won't be anywhere near of there, in fact, he won't leave ""The Smuggler's Moon"" at all, since his Lightsaber and himself will become the newest additions in the largest private collection of Jedi-related artifacts, property of Grakkus, the Hutt! 
 But Luke's captivity won't be long, since he will be kinda trained by the mysterious Gamemaster (a trusted servant of Grakkus, the Hutt) to fight to the death in Grakkus' arena to the amusement of the entire criminal community of Nar Shaddaa. 
 Good that Chewbacca and C-3PO are flying to the rescue, in the Millennium Falcon,... 
 ...Bad that they will find first, Dengar, notorious and dangerous bounty hunter! 
 So, the things are going for our heroes as always... 
 ...yep, that bad! 
 Excellent storyarc, strong in the Force!!!"
3,"This review is for all books in the Shatter Me Series. You can also read this review on my blog. 
 In short: The cool X-Men-esque premise of the Shatter Me Series by Tahereh Mafi is unfortunately overshadowed by a ton of romance melodrama. 
 I think I may be too old for this. At least, that would explain why I had so little tolerance for all the melodramatic romance crap in this series. I had been so enthralled at the enticing premise of Shatter Me when I first heard of it in 2011 - girl who can't have physical contact with anyone without hurting them badly (basically Rogue from X-Men) - and I have wanted to read this series since then. Would I have had more tolerance for the love triangle histrionics had I read the series back when it first came out? Maybe, I'm not sure. 
 Of course, it didn't help matters that I was reading the Shatter Me Series at the same time as I was reading The Raven Cycle for the first time. The Raven Cycle has its fair share of romantic drama too, after all, but it's handled more subtly and it didn't annoy me nearly as much as the melodrama in Shatter Me. I would say it's because the romance drama in The Raven Cycle never consumes the entire story, unlike the romance drama in the Shatter Me Series. I mean, here we have this really cool X-Men-esque storyline set in a dystopian world ruled by a disturbing dictator - SO much promise - and still the overpowering storypoint somehow always turned to hashing out the conflicting petty feelings of the characters in the love triangle. 
 I probably would not have decided to continue on with the series past the first book had I not been listening to the trilogy via audio - I find it's always easier to commit to a series in audiobook form. Plus, there were enough tidbits of intrigue here and there to always keep me going - I do love a good superpower-inspired premise. I just wish the X-Men superhero aspect had been prioritized above all, with a minimum devoted towards an overdramatic love triangle. 
 And as for the writing: much ado has been made about the strikethroughs and people either seem to LOVE it or HATE it. For my part, I'm not sure I can make a decision as to what side of the fence I fall on because I feel like I missed a lot of the intended effect of it by listening to the books in audio instead of reading them. I would be inclined to come down on the side of liking the writing though, if only because it took risks and is unique and I appreciate that. 
 So in the end, I was left feeling pretty disappointed by my Shatter Me experience and more than a little annoyed by the romance melodrama. I think the series had a lot of potential and I can understand why it is well loved by readers that don't mind the love triangle as much. As for Tahereh Mafi's writing: I would like to try it again some time as I think I would like it in another - less romance-oriented - context."
3,I loved Avery and Cam's wedding. Sooo adorable.
4,"Well this was my first dip into the ""Honorverse"" and I really enjoyed it. Some reviews have complained about the technobabble and the lack of characterisation, I personally did not think that at all. I quickly warmed to the characters (and not just Nimitz) and found them all individuals. As to the ""technobabble, and over complicated political situation "" complaints, again, I found no such thing. Sci-fi can be technical, it just depends if you are into that or not. Personally I found it intrinsic to the story line in the end, as it explained the limitations as to what could happen in certain situations (no spoiler intended). As to the political situation and its complexities, you just have to look at the world today and realise it was in fact probably under complicated in this book. 
 So will I continue in this universe, I think the answer is a resounding but qualified yes. Qualified as in there are so many good books, or books I want to read around at the moment, as well as those i read 40 years ago that I want to go back to, and I haven't read the LOTR for some years, nor the 11 or 12 book Asimov (and killer Bs) Foundation Saga (does one start with the Robot stories , hmmmm) for a number of years as well, agh. 
 Add to that the number of non Sci-fi books I want to read and well, I am beginning to realise I don't have that much time available. 
 So was this a good book, yes, very enjoyable. And yes I have ordered book 2 to carry on the series ( how did i miss it 20 years ago ?? )"
5,Worthy worthy of being crowned story-teller of the heart
2,"And some more lies and broken promises. Wow, I'm on a roll with the angel books. Er...Half-angel book since Violet and her friends are mostly half-angels. Violet is like three-quarters from the hints and clues about her mother. 
 Romance. Certainly there's romance. After all the synopsis said, ""...guy she thought she could fall in love with ..."" and yah-yah-yah. Here I am again. I'm cheering for the bad boy (I mean really bad bad bad boy). And I shouldn't be, but he has that irresistible charm that will get Violet into trouble. (So does Warner from Unravel Me, but Warner has charm unlike this dude). 
 As I read every book (or what it feels like) about angel, I feel as if I see more from different views. One book sees angels as bad. Embrace sees angels as good, fallen angels as bad, and demons as really, really you-are-going-to-die bad. It's fascinating to see each fantasy world as it is. Embrace's world isn't that bad. The angels give their powers to a recently born child whose mother has died within a certain time after the baby's birth. The angel's opinions will not be transferred to the baby, but its powers will be. Not too hard to understand, right? 
 The plot goes up and then goes down. I'm horribly reminded of Hush, Hush and its plot at every turn Embrace's plot makes. The writing is not as good as Hush, Hush, but many of the characters remind me of Hush, Hush. 
 For instance, ""the guy she thought she could fall in love with"" happens to be quite similar to Scott. Then Phoenix reminds me of Patch without the nice guy act. Violet seems to be similar to Nora Grey, who sometimes becomes this clueless bimbo (not blond) because the author pretty much made her that way. (Mary Sue, look it up. Actually, don't. You'll be seeing them everywhere if you do. Typically every written character is a Mary Sue). 
 And the ending. We meet fallen angels that aren't as hot as Patch. And that's all I'm going to say.

5,"(This review is based on ARC ebook provided via netgalley in exchange for an honest review.) 
 A short but sweet highly enjoyable lawyer romance. The hero and heroine were both likeable and believable along with a great cast of supporting characters. The author did a wonderful job adding just enough legal jargon to make the characters/setting feel realistic. As it was, I breezed through this book very pleased with the author's writing style and the HEA. 
 If you like a lawyer romance with a strong, career focused heroine who begins to realize the importance of love and friendship, I think you will really enjoy reading this new release by Susan Hatler."
5,"Wow this was good!! I loved the character development, and the development of the world. It's amazing that two different people could come together to write something so seamlessly. 
 My only complaint is that it takes a bit of time to read. The pages are larger than average, and the words smaller. It does slightly feel like insta-love, but that is because we can't be with the characters everyday. 
 All in all, this book was amazing and I can't wait to get my hands on the next one!!"

 Read this review and more on my blog From A to Z. 
 Who doesn't dream of meeting the perfect guy in an airport? Anybody could end up sitting next to you on a plane, so why not the guy of your dreams? To everyone who has ever had a thought similar to this, The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight will be total wish fulfillment. It was for me, and I loved every single second of it. I read the entire book in one sitting with a smile on my face the whole time and a happy sigh at the end of it. I LOVED it. 
 Now, normally I am not a fan of love at first sight stories. I usually like my romance to happen slowly, growing out of friendship with lots of tension and gradually building up to that final payoff. But somehow I was totally on board with everything in Statistical Probability. Despite the title, and the fact that the story takes place over only 24 hours, this does not feel like one of those insta-love YA romances. It's not cheesy or hokey, and it feels totally realistic and believable. Which takes great skill, in my opinion. Way to go, Jennifer. 
 I adored Hadley, fell in love with Oliver, and even grew to like Hadley's parents and her dad's new wife. Hadley and Oliver are both dealing with their own issues, making Statistical Probability more than just a love story, and their romance doesn't overshadow the other things going on in each of their lives. Every facet of the novel was well-balanced and it all meshed together incredibly well. 
 Aaaaaaand let's talk just a little bit more about Oliver, shall we? SWOON. Oliver is... well, he's absolutely wonderful. (He wasn't listed as one of my favorite book boyfriends from 2011 for nothing!) He's incredibly clever and sweet, and he has a wicked sense of humor. He's adorable and funny and charming, he's BRITISH (so many automatic points right there), and he and Hadley have fantastic chemistry together. Airport gods, can I meet an Oliver the next time I travel? PLEASE? Great, thanks. 
 I absolutely adored this book, and if you're a fan of contemporary stories you definitely won't want to miss it. My one complaint would be that it's too short, but in some ways that just makes it feel like a perfect little bite-sized treat. :)"
4,"Not your average sappy love story. And certainly not for those who are into happy endings. 
 This book is full of emotions, and even though it doesnt end on a 'happily-ever-after', it does make you fall in love with the idea of love all over again."

 Malcolm Gladwell has written five books, all of which have been on the New York Times bestseller list. He is extremely readable. 
 This now-famous book is about popular ideas and products, and how they spread through society. Starting off small at first, they slowly gather momentum until they reach a 'tipping point', where they take off and become fantastically popular. This book is all about the mechanics of how this happens, and the different types of people and businesses enabling the process. 
 The best bits for me? The illustration of how we are all incredibly different - how some people are freakishly sociable, others are freakishly knowing, informative and knowledgeable, whilst others have the charisma to sell you anything. Given Gladwell's clear examples I was easily able to slot a couple of my friends into these categories, and therefore relate to the ideas he was describing. These are the movers and shakers - the people who make things happen. 
 He uses a wide range of phenomena to illustrate the idea of social epidemics - the rise to popularity of Hush Puppy shoes, a sudden decline of crime in New York, the success of the children's programmes Sesame Street and Blue Clues, the cleaning up of the New York subway, the spread of new corn seed in Iowa in the 1930s, an increase of suicides in the South Pacific islands of Micronesia, plus the reasons why smoking has drastically increased amongst teenagers in the US, despite strenuous efforts to discourage it. I was impressed by the wide range of his examples. 
 My one criticism is that it was all rather predictable. The relationship between causes and effects were often ones I had heard before, or that I had worked out for myself. Unlike the book Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything I didn't feel that I was being exposed to some really original ideas behind society's statistics. 
 Still - an interesting read by an excellent writer. It clarified several concepts I already had, and made them a lot less woolly."
5,"** spoiler alert ** 
 Ok so I loved the first book in the series and the 2nd one was meh but this one blew my mind. Garret was such a great hero and so huggable ;) 
 Sarah..I liked here even though maybe I didn't want to because she was such a victim but what really made me like her was that she was real, her fear, her emotions everything. She was just trying to make the best of what life had dealt her. And I liked Marcus..I know he was the villain and all but no matter what he loved his sister and risked everything for her. Sarah loved her brother, faults and all and I am glad she didn't flip on him and that her love was real. 
 And I fell in love with Kelly family all over again. Van is Van and he deserves a book, and Rio and Cole and PJ?and ok what the heck everyone!!Rusty is someone I still don't gush over but she is okay I guess. What is up with Sean and her I wonder, or is it something that only I felt?Maybe a friendship of sorts? 
 And Sam is still my least favorite. Maya please do write FAST!!!!;)"
2,"Many thanks to the publisher, HarperCollins, for providing me with an ARC of this book. This in no way impacted my views and opinions below. 
 I know a lot of people have been looking forward to this book, myself being one of them, but I just- couldn't. Three Dark Crowns had an interesting premise and lots of potential, but it unfortunately failed to live up to it. I would've thought that my dislike of this book was because of my reading slump (gosh darn it, school) if I hadn't seen quite a few reviews complaining about it, too. I never DNF books, and yet I was VERY tempted to do so for this book. It was just.so.boring! While I was reading the book, I actually looked up a few spoiler free reviews to see if anyone struggled as much as I did. I found a few, but they said that it gets interesting near the very end (""with a mind-boggling plot twist!!1!"" they said). So I skimmed to the last few pages, and read the ""plot twist"" and all I thought was Okay? That's it?? I was just soo frustrated that I wasted all this time on this book. 
 My main issue with this book is that it's just so tedious and boring. We have three main POVs from three triplet queens - each with her own unique power. Katharine is a poisoner, Arsinoe, a naturalist, and Mirabella, an elemental. They can't get the throne merely by royal birth - no, they have to fight each other to the death in order to get it, and the last one standing becomes Queen until she produces triplets and so on. You'd think that with 3 main characters and 3 POVs I'd enjoy at least one of them, right? Wrong. I didn't look forward to any of the POVs, and I literally didn't care about any of the aforementioned characters. There's Jules, Arsinoe's best friend, though. I didn't hate her as much as the other characters, but I just wish she was developed a bit more. She deserves so much better! 
 Since we're on the topic of characters, let's take a moment to talk about the love triangle. Yes, yes, I hear y'all groaning. I usually don't despise love triangles as much as the rest of the book community seems to do, but this one, you guys, this one. I'm internally screaming in frustration just thinking about it. YOU HAD A PERFECTLY GOOD COUPLE, BUT NOO, YOU JUST HAD TO TURN IT INTO AN UGLY ASS INSTA-LOVE TRIANGLE. Add to that the fact that the love triangle includes cheating? Um, I'm out. I'm not going to post major spoilers, but if you typically dislike love triangles, then this definitely isn't for you. Also, much like the rest of the book, the romance in this book was very dull. There was no spark between the characters and their love interests, and I frankly couldn't care less about any of them. 
 Okay, so let's talk about the actual plot of this book. The reason I haven't talked about it earlier is as follows: it's practically nonexistent for the first 80% of the book. Seriously, for a story about sisters having to kill each other for the throne, the action was seriously lacking. The pacing was slow, and the atmosphere was very quiet and restrained. This book was in desperate need of a healthy dose of bloodletting and politics. It may have picked up toward the very end, but that still doesn't make up for the lack of plot in the first place. 
 In short, I don't think Three Dark Crowns lived up to its hype. I tried to find something positive to add to this review, but I couldn't, so that's saying something. The three main characters were just there, serving no purpose whatsoever, and the pacing of this book was extremely tedious. Plus, the terribly executed love triangle certainly doesn't get any bonus points in my book. It's frustrating thinking about what this book could have been because the premise and cover are absolutely stunning. I may be the black sheep amongst the tons of reviews praising this book, but this just wasn't for me.

3,"Many thanks to St. Martin's Press/St. Martin's Griffin, via NetGalley, for a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review! 
 Okay, I'll be honest. I DNF'd this -- not because the story wasn't interesting, not because the writing was terrible, but because I don't do horror. 
 I wasn't really sure what to rate this, because my personal feelings about horror definitely impact my rating. My inclination was to give 1/5 stars due to my discomfort while reading parts of this book, but at the same time, the writing style is good and the plot hooked me immediately. So I bumped it up to a 3/5 star rating because there's nothing wrong with the book except that I shouldn't have requested it since I don't like horror. :) This mistake will not be made in the future, since I always feel bad when I request an ARC to read but -- for whatever reason -- can't get through it. 
 But I'll admit, I was (and still am) excited about the plotline. I love parallel narratives, I love the idea of figuring out a decades-old secret... but I won't be finishing this (sadly) because I don't want to feed my nightmares with vivid descriptions of, well, horrifying things. 
 (I never read any R.L. Stine books before -- the Goosebumps series was huge when I was growing up but I never read them because I didn't like horror then. When I requested The Lost Girl, I figured that now I'm older, I could probably handle what's labeled as YA horror. Nope. Nope nope nope. I don't need any more fodder for my already vivid and awful nightmares.) 
 So if you're someone like me, who doesn't generally read horror and knows that novels in that genre will be ""too much,"" don't make the mistake I did and see if YA horror is doable. But if you like horror, I'd say why not? give this a try."
4,"Excellent book! I actually prefer this to The Sea of Monsters. I really enjoyed this installment if the Percy Jackson series. I can't wait to read The Last Olympian, now! I love the snark that goes with Percy and all the creative mythology infused with the modern world. It's really ingenious. 
 A solid book by Rick Riordan. If you love YA books, mythology, and a really funny (LOL kinda funny) series-- you NeED to read Percy Jackson! It's brilliant!"
4,"This is one of those rare instances where I feel like this book is objectively great in both narrative and writing but I just didn't really connect with it. I understand how this book was amazingly creative and the characters were richly detailed, making it a really good book... but maybe just not the book for me. It's sort of a literary ""It's not you, it's me"" situation. It was objectively great but not great personally. 
 I really can't complain about anything nor can I think of any instances where I felt the author faltered. What it really comes down to is a matter of taste. (Again, it's not you, it's me!) I could talk about things that I would have wanted to see, I.E. romance, but I think that would be a bit disingenuous to the characters themselves. This had a sort of Romeo and Juliet vibe but minus the romance. I respect the hell out of Victoria Schwab for making this decision. Personally, I like books better when there are smooches. Hey... at least I'm honest about it. Ha! 
 Overall, This Savage Song is such a wildly original concept: acts of violence have become so pervasive that they now spawn real live monsters from the aftermath. LOVE IT! Kate and August are such complex and interesting characters and their inner monologues were some of the best writing I've seen in a while. AGAIN, PROPS TO VICTORIA SCHWAB! If it came down to it: Would I recommend This Savage Song? Yes, absolutely! Did I personally like it? ...Sort of."
0,"I enjoyed this series quite a bit a few years ago but now the books don't really do much for me. Maybe I'll pick the series up again sometime in the future, but for now I'm going to DNF the series."
3,"Linda Castillo's debut thriller, ""Sworn to Silence"", set in Amish country in Ohio, is deftly written and suspenseful, if a bit derivative. It's a ""Silence of the Lambs"" meets ""Witness"". The book starts slow, but Castillo picks up the pace right away and never lets up until the end, with a plot twist that I personally didn't see coming. My one and only complaint is that Castillo lapses occasionally into gratuitous sex and extreme violence. Not that I'm against any of that stuff, but her story works well without it."
5,"Kristin Cashore blew me away with her debut novel Graceling. When I'd read Graceling, Fire had already been released. I was hesitant to read Fire because I didn't know how it would be. After reading Fire, though, I am no longer worried. Kristin Cashore's writing was just as engaging and beautiful as before. 
 Fire is set about 30 some years before Graceling in the land called The Dells. The impossible mountains to climb in Graceling? The Dells is on the other side. Such a different world from Graceling yet similar too. the description that Cashore put in for this new setting was...very visible. I could see the world in my head. 
 The plot was long. There was a lot of description and background but in an overall sense, it was necessary. First, we had to know what was happening and why. Second, the reader does not want to be confused or lost. The reader wants to understand the book and to do that, there has to be background information. With variations in the pace of the events and actions, Fire was a whirlwind of everything. 
 Fire, our protagonist, is the last remaining human monster. She is both loved and hated by the people. Her ability to control people's minds in greatly feared but wanted to be used as well. Fire was a strong, independent girl who knew what she wanted...most of the time. This novel is basically this girl's journey and need to distinguish herself from her father and this made her...guarded, independent, and well, stubborn. I didn't connect with her as I connected with Katsa and I think it's due to the fact that a lot of times during this book, Fire is so unstable. She also wasn't open enough for me. 
 There were a lot of secondary characters in this book, so sometimes I got confused. Sure a lot of them weren't there as often as others, but it still got confusing. I liked and disliked each character for their own reason. Archer, for one, was a ladies' man. He was in love with Fire and wanted her to marry him. Whenever he asked and she said no, he'd take a woman to bed. I liked him for his bravery and loyalty but he got annoying sometimes too. Brigan was a character I initially didn't like. He was so mean and cold hearted. After reading more about him, though, my thoughts changed. I saw (as did Fire) that he'd had a lot happen in his life, most of which wasn't pleasant, and that is what made him the way he was. 
 I should add that there was more sex in this novel than there was in Graceling. There isn't a lot of description but it's mentioned and referred to. The plot got more complicated when an illegitimate child was born or revealed. I was confused as to who was whose child and I had to pause a few times to figure out. 
 Overall? Fire was a good book that showed Cashore's excellent writing ability. I liked Graceling better than this one, but only by a little. It had a great amount of action, mystery, danger, adventure, romance, obsession, and so much more. I can't wait for Bitterblue!"
2,"I did not enjoy this book. Also, I did not enjoy this book. Of note: it was supposed to be the best novel of the modern era (according to Jack Murnighan in Beowulf on the Beach). But I did not enjoy this book."
4,"Wait... what! That is not the end of the book, right? There must be a sequel to this? 
 This book was really good, it reminded me a little of Six of Crows."
4,"Summary: Usually contemporaries are something that you want to go in blind and I went into this book only knowing that was about two males who are in love with the same girl at different points in her life. I think that's all you need to know...

5,"The night quiet was broken by the high, distant trill of a whistle, the traditional swarming noise of city watches everywhere. Several other whistles joined in a few moments later. 
 ""It is possible,"" said Locke with a sheepish grin, ""that I have been slightly too bold."" 
 With his sights set on the Sinspire, a gambling house no one's ever stolen from and lived, Locke Lamora is in the city state of Tal Verarr. The game is proceeding as planned, and Locke and Jean are looking forward to their hard-earned windfall. But the Bondsmagi of Karthain have a long memory, and soon someone else in Tal Verarr wants Locke and Jean's expertise. Before long, Locke and Jean find themselves engaged in piracy, and are once again embroiled in a fight for their lives. 
 Once again, wow. 
 I knew I'd like this book from the moment that Locke hopes Jean gets his cock sucked by a shark. Yes, that is a thing. 
 I have to admit, I wasn't expecting as much from this book as from the first one. Second books tend to have a bit of a stigma surrounding them. I take back any hesitation I had. 
 Okay, some people might not like the fact that there's more than one plot thread going on (though they tie up neatly in the end), and the fact that the piracy plotline doesn't start until you're a fair chunk into the book. But, you know, I liked that. Locke's life, with its layers upon layers of deception, isn't going to be straightforward. There's going to be complications. Just as his Sinspire game looks to be going well, BAM. Something HUGE comes along and messes up all his plans and he has to do major damage control. 
 Kind of like the first book. 
 Poor Locke. I believe that he had some major character growth going on in this book. The events in the last book have taken their toll on him and his relationship with Jean, and I feel like he's growing up. He seems to think more about consequences (well, sometimes), and isn't quite as cocksure and reckless as he was in the first book. 
 And we see the aftermath of the first book, even though this first one is set two years after the end. For the first part of the book, we get reminiscences of the previous two years, bringing us up to date on Locke and Jean's adventures to the starting point of the novel. I liked this feature. Not only was it in keeping with Lynch's style (like the flashbacks in book one), I'm glad we got to see what happened in the missing two years of time. Locke and Jean's relationship was strained to the breaking point, and we got to see that, and see the ramifications of that even two years later. 
 We also get to see the beginnings of the Sinspire game, which, in the main plot, is coming to a close. All in all, I really enjoyed the flashbacks. I always enjoy when an author is clever with time, and with their narrative structure. Especially when it's not confusing at all. 
 The prologue was and is, I admit, a dirty trick. Prologues that are a scene from somewhere near the end of the novel always put me in two minds as a reader. Firstly, I don't want to know what's going to happen. I don't want to spend the entire book waiting for this scene, or feeling anxious because it hasn't happened yet. No, thank you. On the other hand, I admire the ballsy hook. 
 Jean got some character development too! I appreciated the scenes from his point of view - I know there were a few in Lies, but not nearly as many. Jean is the source of MANY FEELS in this novel, just to warn you. I was SO HAPPY and then I was DISTRAUGHT. That aside, you really get to see what a damn good friend he is to Locke. Locke puts him through so much crap sometimes, and yet he is still always there. Always looking out for him. 
 I love their friendship. They would die for each other. Just die. And we get to see evidence for this over and over again. It's not just words for them. It was never just words. 
 Let's talk about some of the other characters in this book. I LOVE the badass women pirates. I love the fact that Scott Lynch's world is so totally different than our own when it comes to gender roles. Being a woman doesn't stop any of his characters doing anything. His women are as real and vibrant as his men, with as many nuances and shades of grey and badass awesome moments. 
 Like Zamira. She's a middle-aged pirate woman, a captain of one of the most feared pirate ships in the Brass Sea. She also is the single mum of two kids, and is raising them right out there on the high seas. She's a great character. She oozes authority, and courage, and you definitely do not want to get on her bad side. 
 There are, of course, other great characters. I particularly liked the antagonists in this one. I felt that they had a lot of depth to them, rather than just being assholes for the sake of assholes. There are loads of other characters I could mention - Ezri, for instance - but you really need to experience them for yourself. 
 There is no map at the beginning of this one, which was a grievance I had in the last book. Once again, I feel that the novel would have benefitted from the inclusion of one. 
 The writing, though. I love the way Scott Lynch can turn a phrase. I really, really do. Amongst beautiful descriptions and plenty of atmosphere building, there are moments of pure humour and snark and wondrous narration. 
 For example: 
 ""Mew,"" the kitten retorted, locking gazes with him. It had the expression common to all kittens, that of a tyrant in the becoming. 'I was comfortable, and you dared to move,' those jade eyes said. 'For that you must die.' When it became apparent to the cat that its two or three pounds of mass were insufficient to break Locke's neck with one mighty snap, it put its paws on his shoulders and began sharing its drool-covered nose with his lips. He recoiled. 
 I am in love with his writing. Pure, unadulterated love. *swoons like a maiden* 
 Whilst The Lies of Locke Lamora can stand alone as a novel, the same isn't entirely true of this one. Sure, the main plotlines are all wrapped up at the end, but there is a massive great question mark left hanging over the characters. Technically, you can read this one as a standalone too, but I, for one, am very glad to have the next book sitting right next to me. 
 If you like cons and thieves and brutal fantasy and enjoyed The Lies of Locke Lamora, read this book. If you haven't read The Lies of Locke Lamora, read that first, then come and read this book. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
4,"(4 to 4.5/5) 
 Rainbow Rowell really captures what it is to be a fan, and it's absolutely brilliant. I really fell for her main character, Cath, with all her insecurities, her social anxiety, as well as her strengths. Her journey through this first year of college is captivating, and quite believable. 
 I also loved the little excerpts of ""Simon Snow"" or fanfics or articles between each chapter, it really helps us get into Cath's world. And I'm definitely buying Carry On!!"
3,"I'd give this 3.5 stars if that were an option. The portrayal of two very dysfunctional families is perfectly believable. There are some surprises in the end, and a good comeuppance for a bad person. I listened to the audio book, which is well-read. I don't give it a higher rating because all the disparate parts do not always fit together very well."
5,"Another cliffhanger ending with a twist in the last few sentences! A great quest with adventure, excitement, intrigue and struggle. I'm also thankful for the lack of romance when there are so many other things to focus on. Now I have to wait for the third book to come out!"
5,"Jackson Jones is the most popular student at Nathan Hale Elementary School. He is the star of the football team, good looking and was loved by his teachers. His biggest hobby was bullying the nerds of Nathan Hale, and there were a lot of them. All of Jackson's popularity changed, however, when he found himself wearing braces and headgear. He had become a nerd. 
 None of Jackson's friends would talk to him, but he began noticing something about the nerds. They always sneezed all at the same time. And then they would leave class. Jackson followed them one day, and watched the nerds all shove themselves into lockers. He did the same and after falling through the locker floor heard ""Welcome to the Playground."" There he found out about the nerds: they were superheroes and part of the NERDS, the National Espionage, Rescue and Defense Society. The leader of the NERDS was Mr. Brand, who was also the school janitor. He decides to let Jackson be a part of the team, despite the kids not wanting the biggest bully in school to join them. Jackson gets his braces specialized and finds himself trying to save the world, even after getting kicked off of the team. 
 This is a great book that has a positive message for those ""nerds"" who might not always fit in with their peers. Jackson is a classic school bully, and he learns that being a bully doesn't always pay off. 
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will be recommending it to 4th-6th grade kids at school this fall, especially boys! During the 2010-2011 school year, this book was the 13th most checked out book at my school, and I expect it to move up the list this year. 
 Here are some of my favorite quotes from the book: 
 If everyone was an oddball, why had he been singled out as a nerd? --NERDS 
 The herd might have been a collection of misshapen goobers, but at least they had each other. --NERDS 
 The dorks, dweebs, goobers and spazzes that you picked on are the ones who will grow up to discover the vaccines, write the great novels, push the boundaries of science and technology and invent things that make people healthier and happier. Nerds change the world. --NERDS"

4,"I read this on the not too distant back of Remains of the Day. I would class Remains of the Day to be one of my favourite reads - it accomplishes many things; bittersweetness, lightness, introspection, humour...so it was easy to choose to pick up Ishiguro's newest book - even more so because it was billed as a fantasy novel, and I am a huge fantasy fan. 
 I found The Buried Giant left me conflicted. Whilst there were times in which I felt transported, intruiged by the concept, the mystery and the heavily intertwined original and Arthurian lore...I also at times felt that The Buried Giant was an incredibly difficult read. in fact there were two separate occasions in which I almost gave up completely. 
 I can't say for sure the reasons why. Perhaps that the characterisation sometimes suffered, shallow because it was sacrificed to beautiful language and lore. The world building swung from rich to lean, for me. I think the repetitiveness which seems to have been a problem for most was less of an issue for me, as I could chalk it down to a part of the plot, and one which complemented the main concept well enough to not cause me frustration. Supporting characterisation drew my attention and I wish more time had been dedicated to the characters on the periphery. 
 Overall this reads as a traditional tale. Ishiguro captures the Arthurian style brilliantly, for me saving the endeavour. A challenging but rewarding read - but unlike Ishiguro's previous work and not to be read under the assumption that it will be."
4,"This is the exact book to play with your thoughts. Which side to favor- life or death? 
 VERONIKA MADE ME CONTEMPLATE ON THOUGHTS THAT PERHAPS: 
 'When some are told by other people that they wanted to die.. these ""some"" actually thought they want to die. The ""some"" are wrong. If the ""other people"" wanted to really die, they would have done so, without resorts, doubts or fear, without addressing it to the public actually. 
 It's the other way around. The people who plead death actually wanted to live. They want to feel life, escape or disappear for a while. Their very existence hinders them from the GOOD promises of life... and this confuses them to actually grow fond and/or desire death. 
 Nobody had lived to tell tales of wandering the path of death. 
 All they know is that no dead had come back to reconquer life. And perhaps, death is promising... that no dead complained about it, that no dead had wanted to escape it, and perhaps to them... death is life.' 
 Books are not meant to be this influential to crack up readers' eandering demand to answer self actualization... Mr. Coelho you have done it, you goddamn genius..."
4,"The thirteen year age difference between the two leads was a little hard to stomach at first, but T.J. and Anna had such great chemistry that by the end of it, I was okay with how it played out. I'm not overly excited about the pairing, because again, THIRTEEN YEARS APART (ick) is a bit too much for me, but kudos to Garvis-Graves for making a potentially awkward plot line flow seamlessly and with incredible ease! Four stars!"
3,"*update: after re-reading my review and editing it, and really taking time to think about my rating, I decided to round down from the 3.5. I just don't think this is really a solid 4 book.* 
 3.5, rounding up because this totally surprised, floored, and dumbfounded me in the very last chapter. Review to come!"
3,"This was an interesting read. 
 (view spoiler)[This story is in a futuristic world. At the start this left me confused as nothing was mentioned clearly. But this became obvious as the story progresses. 
 I would loved to understand the new world better but very less was mentioned about it like the different districts, their importance, the people from each district and their characteristics. I see that this is the first in a series and hope this is explained better in the coming books. 
 At first the hero comes of as anti-hero but the novel progresses and the story takes a twist. 
 Sometimes the link between the existing and flashback story is not very clear and left me confused. 
 Also, at the end when it is revealed that the heroine has an alter ego responsible for all the bad things and the alter ego was in a relation with the hero, it is not very clearly explained as to when and how many times the alter ego and hero interact. Also, is the alter ego destroyed or if the evil one still there? (hide spoiler)] 
 I am very keen to read the next inline series and see how the story continues. 
 The video games, the way it is played and the situations that arise due to it are really cool"

3,"Good writing and story, I just couldn't make it through the constant embarrassing situations that the heroine was throwing herself into. I finally gave up half way through."
4,"My first Agatha Christie novel and I loved it! It was such a page-turner. Everyone was behaving suspiciously, it was hard to zero in on one. And even when I did suspect someone, they just got killed off next. After page 200, I was so sure (grinning happy) that I figured out who the murderer was but boy was I wrong. It would have been great if someone from the crew figured out who the killer was, someone was close enough. I wish I just saw all the clues though (damn) but they were all equally suspicious. The epilogue and the written confession by the murderer did solve the mystery but they weren't as intriguing as the actual happenings in Soldier Island (that's why I'm giving it a 4 star instead of a 5). 
 My favourite character: Philip Lombard"
5,"If I wasn't already a fan of Kim Fielding, this book would do it for me. This is by far my favorite of her novels. What a beautiful and hopeful story, centered on an important piece of gay history. I knew some of the things described here, but I hadn't realized they were such recent history (other than more recent methods of ""curing"" gay people). 
 The juxtaposition of the two eras was the best part of the novel. Had it centered only on the terrible and sad story of Bill--told through the letters--it would have become another in a long line of gay tragedies which marked earlier genre lit. Had it excluded the history and only centered on William and Colby's present-day relationship it would have been nothing more than a standard romance. It's the pairing of the two, and William's own emerging from his painful past, which makes this story truly great. 
 This would be a tough read for anyone who has been through ""ex-gay"" therapy of any type or who is old enough to remember the days when gay novels were largely doomed romance. It will also hit a nerve for people who have been involuntarily admitted to mental health facilities. However, there's a lot of hope here, including the way in which William and his friends choose to preserve the history he's unearthed in the old hospital. 
 I don't see it as being played for drama or as making light of serious crimes against humanity in mental health treatment. The author touches on a variety of sensitive subjects, and I see this more as a way of ensuring we don't repeat the past. This is not really a story about the horrors of how the mentally ill have been dehumanized; it's about a specific and brutal homophobic system. By comparing it with William's present-day experiences, it's made starkly clear that while we're no longer carving people up as treatment, we haven't gotten entirely past the idea gay people need to be fixed. The story should be read with that in mind. 
 In the end, this is far less about William's romance with Colby and much more about bigger and more complicated themes. If I have any complaint at all it's that I think this could have worked just as well as a much longer story. Regardless, it's a well-written novel containing important documentation of a dark era. 
 I received a free copy via Inked Rainbow in exchange for an honest review."
4,"Hmmm.. yet another novel that I would like to give a 3.5 stars to. I did enjoy this book, but I agree with many people that some of the violence and sex was a little much. I did find myself skimming paragraphs to avoid those scenes. All in all I thought the concept of the book was intriguing,and I'm glad I tackled this 983 page book!!"
4,I actually really liked this one. It's set during the Prohibition in New York and there's stage magic and emotion sensing and Houdini and all sorts of shenanigans. It moves at a good pace and the characters are interesting. I approve.
5,"Somehow the word ""novelist"" doesn't quite capture Yann Martel's art. If I had to describe what he does, I might say he writes storybooks for adults. They often have talking animals and a kind of magical realism. They can be extraordinarily effective in reflecting us back at ourselves. He questions the ordinary, celebrates the fantastic. ""Stories benefit the human mind."" We understand through stories, and each of us interprets a story differently. 
 Martel's new novel drops us into a strange and distant land, at a time before any of us can claim first-hand knowledge. While he presents the facts of the case, we wonder what knowledge we are meant to bring to aid understanding. We listen, feeling homeless, unsure. He then leads us homeward, and in the last third we find ourselves quite at home and at peace...with a chimpanzee...in Portugal. 
 Religious belief, the bond animals and humans share, and big questions (""That's the great, enduring challenge of our modern times, is it not, to marry faith and reason?"") are enduring themes in Martel's work. We move through a century in one family's history, collecting wisdom, only to have to succeeding generations keep the form but not the reason for an added custom, like walking backward in a state of grief, or the name and circumstance of one they worship as a ""saint."" In three parts we have three married couples, all of whom have lost one lifelong partner, searching for meaning in their grief. ""Grief is a disease. We were riddled with its pockmarks, tormented by its fevers, broken by its blows. It ate at us like maggots, attacked us like lice--we scratched ourselves to the edge of madness. In the process we became as withered as crickets, as tired as old dogs."" 
 Martel's stories are always filled with symbolism, some sitting on the surface and easy to discover, and others discovered only after much contemplation. Real issues critical to our understanding of the world are treated with whimsy and humor, not scorn or disdain. 
 Martel makes the point that neurosurgeon Paul Kalanithi makes in his memoir When Breath Becomes Air: that the goodness and blind faith required of us by religion is too hard to live up to on a daily basis. Reason is easier, both to comprehend and to use as a kind of measure of goodness. Neither faith nor reason is enough on its own: neither explains the world adequately. ""Reason is blind. Reason, on its own, leads us nowhere, especially in the face of adversity."" And what of joy? Love? Reason doesn't explain those, either. 
 Martel creates a character who suggests that an Agatha Christie murder mystery might combine the two: ""the solution [is] stories that put reason on brilliant display while keeping one close to Jesus of Nazareth."" He compares the form of Agatha Christie novels to the gospels and hypothesizes that both are stories with a central murder mystery. The facts are laid out with great formality and ceremony, but no one ever seems to remember who the murderer is. Who killed Jesus? It is true that murder mysteries are compulsive reading material for adults, as are our bibles, whichever religion we examine. 
 Martel goes further. He takes the central imagic trope in the novel, an ancient carved wooden crucifix, and proposes us that the figure of Christ on the Cross might actually be a Chimp on the Cross--a crudely-carved naive attempt at perspective, a statement on the development of man from ape, or a challenge that man was more pure, present, and godlike before he developed reason. That would be to say nothing of the literal: that humans have lorded over and crucified wild animals, even those so close in genealogy to ourselves, bringing us shame and not salvation. 
 Martel has no sacred cows. Reviewers have criticized him in the past for challenging the sanctity of well-protected myths and histories. I find Martel dazzling in his fearlessness, rigorous in his thinking, and deep in his conclusions. He is not dismissive of faith: he thinks it both interesting and necessary, providing a kind of useful moral structure. The formal ritual of organized religion does not impress him: ""architectural modesty best suits the religious sentiment. Only song needs to soar in a church; anything fancier is human arrogance disguised as faith."" 
 There is something intoxicating and deeply reassuring about the final section of the book in which is recounted the story of Odo the chimp, rescued from the research lab in America's southwest. Odo is old and wise enough to have developed a kind of culture and a rudimentary understanding of language. He can communicate, if not without misunderstandings. Odo seems to have no notion of past and future; he is all about the present. His human companion, Peter, discovers that he would prefer to become more Odo-like in his ""profound simplicity of means and aims...members of [Peter's] own species...are too noisy, too fractious, too arrogant, too unreliable. He much prefers the intense silence of Odo's presence, his pensive slowness in whatever he does..."" 
 A couple of last things: There is a profoundly affecting marriage consummation scene in this novel which gives readers a glimpse into what kind of man the author is, for who else could create such a scene? Both husband and wife are virgins; he twenty-one and she seventeen. Sex itself is all still a mystery, but they work it out together. The bride had never known desire, nor where hers lay, but her new husband searched for, and found, her hidden place and they lived and loved passionately ever after. Martel makes it beautiful, sexy, joyous, and absolutely right-sounding. 
 Was there ever an Iberian Rhinocerous? I doubt it, though he had me believing, just a little. 
 I'm a fan."
3,"I'm on the fence about this book. I wasn't a huge fan of the main character or her best friend. However, the plot and themes made me think quite a bit, which is a good thing and rather surprising for a young adult novel."
5,"Well that was different. I've never really been fond of time travel in cartoons or films even though I do find the idea of paradoxes fascinating. 
 What I loved about this book wasn't much of the time travel thing but more about the storyline and characters. I liked the mystery surrounding Em and Finn and the documents they were being tortured about. Then there was James and Marina. I never really liked James he just got so blinded by power and what he thought was right. Marina and Em were very realistic I thought. In fact they're probably some of the most real characters I've ever read about. 
 This book made me think about what a future with time travel will be like. What would happen really to those who try to change history? Has anyone tried to change history and suffered a consequence? What will a real paradox be like? And finally how will humans handle something as powerful as a time machine when their egos and desires get the better of them? With great power comes great responsibility."
4,"I read nearly 3/4 of this book curled up in my easy chair while the kids napped, snow falling softly outside. It is rare that I get that much peace and quiet anymore, so I roared through the book, wanting to finish it before the twins awoke and shattered the peace. 
 Therefore, any nitpicks I have about anything in the book feeling rushed are no doubt of my own doing, as I manically flipped pages, wanting to find out what happened to Rory and the rest of the gang. When the series is over, I look forward to reading all the books again, and savoring them a bit more. 
 Needless to say, I loved this book. Definitely my favorite novel to date this year. I am sure Johnson's Shade of London series isn't for everyone, but I've fallen for American-based Rory, a transplant in London, who can now see ghosts. It sounds preposterous, but Johnson has made it work- and work well- in all three novels so far. I love Rory, I love her character, and I love the group of people she's come to surround herself in London - far away from the home she knows in New Orleans. 
 *spoilers if you haven't read the first two books - which you should, immediately!* 
 In book three, Rory is dealing with the grief of losing Stephen, as the team frantically tries to find his ghost. They are also trying to find her prefect, Charlotte, who was kidnapped by Rory's therapist, Jane. We learn more about Jane and her past involvement in an ancient cult and a likely string of murders. It all involves a much bigger plot involving London's ability to harness its dead, and the existence of a murky, rumored government organization who polices ghosts. 
 We also meet a new character in this novel, Freddie (a girl), who is quite bright, but of whom I still remain suspicious - silly, perhaps, but it's so hard to trust new people coming into the gang. We see more of Jerome, which is nice, and Boo and Callum, of course. There's actually less focus on actual ghosts than you'd think and more on some big conspiracies, but it all works, really well. The camaraderie of the team, and the way Johnson voices Rory is just lovely, and the book reads so well. Even what should be a crazy plot is made readable and believable through the lens of these developed characters. 
 As always, I'm left a bit bereft, waiting for the next book. (And, for the record, I finished the last few pages right before the twins woke up. I feel like that's fate, right?)"
2,"There has been so much buzz for Carrier of the Mark over the last couple of months that I was really excited to get hold of a copy and start reading. I had high hopes for the story but unfortunately I found myself feeling a bit disappointed by the end of it. I hate to make comparisons between books and it's something I try to avoid doing in reviews but I can't help but compare this to Twilight. I was shocked by the number of similarities in the plot and there were quite a few instances when I knew exactly what would happen next because it followed the Twilight pattern. I've seen other reviewers on Goodreads make detailed comparisons to the two books so I'm not going to list all the similarities here but there are a lot of them. 
 Neither of the main characters particularly stood out for me, they are both OK but I didn't love them. I'm also getting a bit fed up with the trend for insta love in YA paranormal stories. Occasionally the author manages to make it believable but more often than not it just leaves me frustrated. Megan and Adam have been staring at each other for weeks but have barely spoken but the next thing you know they are declaring their love for each other. Please at least have a proper conversation and spend some time getting to know each other before you decide you're madly in love and can't live without each other. 
 What kept me reading was the paranormal aspect of the story, I don't want to give anything away so I'll just say I've not read anything else based on Irish mythology before and I found it really interesting. There was quite a lot of info dumping going on though which I found confusing and I still don't quite understand what makes Megan different to Aine. I am very curious to find out more about their abilities though and will pick up the sequel just to see how things develop. 
 Although Carrier of the Mark isn't perfect and there were things that irritated me I do think the series has potential. As this is a debut I'm looking forward to seeing how Leigh Fallon's writing style grows with subsequent novels and I'm hoping that as she finds her feet as an author the story will become more original as the series progresses. If she can take her unique mythology and move it in a different direction from Twilight then the series has real potential"
5,I loved this book. How did I miss it for so long. I am so happy I have a new series to catch up on.
4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 I really wanted to read something fantasy and my tbr doesn't have a lot of that sort of thing on it except for this one. It's quite a long book and what I know about the fantasy genre is that sometimes things get to be a little bit drawn out or a little TOO much detail goes into things and it all gets a little muddled. 
 Well while I thought this was a little bit slow at times, I don't think it had too much info dumping or unnecessary detail. In fact I found myself sort of annoyed that there was so much our main character didn't know about the land she was supposed to rule. 
 This story had a lot of interesting characters and a somewhat interesting world as a whole except that the main thing I didn't really love about this book was how it almost tried to be slightly dystopian. There were glimpses and details of a much more modern world in the past which had been lost in the ""crossing"" which was a fleet of ships crossing the ocean from where? And heading to lands which were somehow unknown? And the dude in charge of the crossing put all the doctors and nurses and medical and scientific knowledge and devices all on one ship which happened to be the one to sink and there were survivors in the water but they couldn't go back for them. I don't know, seems to me there's more of a reason than just accidental behind that. 
 I am not sure if I just forgot already or if I missed a part accidentally where they said why the crossing had to happen and what was going on in the old modern world to make everyone try to flee, but maybe there'd be more about that in the rest of the series? 
 Also something I didn't care for was how Kelsea wouldn't stop mentioning her weight. She's overweight and people like the Fetch and herself have no problem making it known that she is not attractive and it's kind of annoying. This is a change from all of the other female lead protagonists who are just simply ""plain"" but wildly attractive to one or more lead male characters. However, why can't we ever have a book where the character is simply described without any negative connotation or why can't a character be described as however but have it not matter to the storyline. Maybe a lead female is stunning but her love interest doesn't care for her romantically and never does. Idk, just sort of a trope thing that always happens. 
 I am not for sure if I plan to pick up the rest of the series but I do feel partially invested in this. We know there is a war to come, we know the red queen is up to no good but we don't know exactly what's going on yet, I think that Kelsea will miraculously become thinner between books which will make her more attractive in the way that her features will all suddenly fit together and make sense and there should be a romance to come. Although a romance with the Fetch seems too obvious, it would also be controversial and interesting, as would a romance be with one of her guard, maybe Pen? Also interested to see more about the sapphires and their history and what they can do. We know that Kelsea's mother wore both and nothing extraordinary ever happened. Also, who is Kelsea's father?? 
 I guess it sounds like I'm interested in enough of this story to continue on in the series so we will see! =P"
5,I HATE that I half-assed watching most of the movies and already know the big spoilers. And I hate that (view spoiler)[Lupin and Black are no longer with us. I hope they show up again in the coming books. (hide spoiler)]I don't remember if they do XD
2,"I believed in love, but I believed in evil, too. Neither love nor evil conquers all, but evil cheats more. 
 ........................................... 
 I like Micah. I still don't get why the sex is a bad thing, I mean...sure its ridiculous, but the series itself is ridiculous too. Sure it goes totally against the way Anita was when the series started...but frankly, Anita annoys the crap out of me, so I don't care much."
5,"I'm so happy that the novellas was published... 
 WARNER'S POV IN PAPERBACK!!! (Best Valentines gift!!!) 
 Now I can easily go back go back go back and read Warner's POV anytime I want. 
 This includes, Destroy Me, Fracture Me and Juliette's Journal. 
 When I'm reading the journal, I keep going back to Warner's POV. 
 Finding every part of the journal there then reading his feelings about it. 
 And that is the thing that made me SO HAPPY despite my grave and devastating midterm exams... 
 But I prefer if the journal was printed the way how I imagined it to be. 
 Like messy? with numbers or words anywhere? (well, that's how I imagined it) 
 I'll also prefer if it's the same size as the other books. (because mine is shorter) 
 And I really wish, there won't be a book set version of this novel. (Selfish? YES! But I'll be so disappointed if that happens because I already bought individual books.) 
 Overall, I like the book. I like Warner. I LOVE THIS NOVEL."
4,"This was really good. One thing I really love about it is how it was told. It was first person but also third person. If you read the book you know what I mean, but if you haven't read it to find out. It's really hard to explain but is there a name for that? All I can say about this book that it's worth reading."
5,"Brought to you by OBS reviewer Autumn 
 Olivia is determined to keep her nose to the grindstone. She definitely doesn't have the time for another ""bad boy"". So when she meets Cash Davenport, she instantly knows that he is as bad as they get. He is insanely sexy, arrogant and worst of all, tempting. He is the polar opposite of his twin brother, Nash, who just happens to be the devoted boyfriend of her very annoying cousin, Marissa. Nash is a respected professional and is equally as hot. He also has the same Davenport charm and intensity that Olivia can't seem to stay away from. 
 Olivia soon faces that she is attracted to both of them but Cash wants her. And what Cash wants, Cash always gets. Olivia knows she has to choose. Should she follow her head or her heart? 
 I have been a long time fan of M. Leighton so when she decided to venture into the New Adult genre, I knew it was going to be incredible. Down to You has all of the ingredients for a seriously scorching book - bad boys with tattoos, motorcycles and sexual tension that can't be measured using existing technology. (I may never be the same after the infamous bathroom scene!) The story has a twist that I figured out before the big reveal but it only added to my anticipation to see how the characters developed through it. I would highly recommend this to fans of both New Adult and Romance. The next installment, Up to Me (The Bad Boys #2) has already been released so what are you waiting for?

3,"I'm a little split on this book. By the end, I would say that it is my favourite of the series so far, but my main complaint about this series is still valid: It is really slow paced. They needed to have pared down the story and kept it flowing better. This one dragged a bit in the middle and it wasn't really until the last 150 or so pages that I was flying madly through it to find out what happened. My other complaint about this one was that all this weird stuff was happening to Ethan yet he didn't feel the need to tell anyone about it. It just makes no sense whatsoever. And the parts with Marian and the Keepers and the door were clunky and seemed thrown in to pave the way for the next book. Why didn't Ethan just TELL people what he saw the first time he went through the door so that they could protect her in the first place? Again, another thing Ethan didn't feel the need to share with anyone."
4,"Another book club selection - A charming, well-written tale. The author successfully weaves two timelines together into one continuous story. Things are never what they seem to be in Manifest."
3,"I'll probably read a few more in this series to see if it grows on me, but this wasn't really my type of mystery. The characters were engaging, and I think it was more them than the plot that kept me reading, since I was only mildly curious about the resolution. 
 Also, if you're at all into fat activism, this is definitely not a pleasant read."
5,"This feels like a filler. Not much happens, I guess this provides the ground for the third book but dammit I loved it. I love all the characters. They are precious little demons. This is a great series. 
 Edited on January 4th, 2017. 
 I reread this book. Wtf why did I call it a filler? I FREAKING LOVE THIS SERIES OH MY GOD. The characters. MY PRECIOUS BABIES."
2,"There are zero spoilers in the review below, but for the sake of nitpickers everywhere, I'll keep the review spoiler tagged for a while. 
 **Dropped this to two stars. The more I think about it the more bothered I get.** 
 (view spoiler)[Ok. Here's the deal. I liked it. My expectations for this were very, very low and because of that I ended up not being horrendously disappointed. Being a script, I anticipated the fact that there was no possible way this story could blow me away. There was definitely a feeling of ""is this cheesy fanfic"" at points that perhaps would not be as obvious if you were actually seeing the play. 
 The only reason this even remotely worked as a script book is because we are already familiar with the world of Harry Potter. You can get away with bare bones and dialog because the images of these places and characters are already in your mind. I'm a bit torn on how to rate this because of the nature of the format, so I'm going to go with a middle of the road 3 stars. I enjoyed it, would have rather consumed it the way it was intended (play form) but I'm glad I got to experience it at all. 
 (hide spoiler)]"
5,"** spoiler alert ** 
 I always love when I love a book more than I thought I would. Everything about this story was just so engaging, fun, and just refreshing! I love all the relationships the family relationships, especially between the sisters, the friendships, and of course the boys. I just thought this was a very clever story on a topic that is told over and over again. I can hardly wait for the follow-up book, I would have been very bummed if there wasn't a conclusion!"
3,"The beginning was kind of dull, but that ending was so great."
2,"Man, I wanted to like this book. Given how long I waited for the audiobook to become available at the library, I really, really wanted to love the book. 
 However, I just couldn't. I've spent probably six hours listening, and I just don't care about a single character. Even the main character I just want to die - and stay dead - already! None of the characters are engaging or sympathetic, and there's no real conflict, other than a bratty older brother, and the fact that Ursula keeps dying. It's basically a book about a bunch of English plutocrats being plutocratic. 
 Maybe it gets better in hour 7. I'm not going to stick around to find out when I could be watching some exciting paint dry."
2,"First of all, this did not come close to living up to the hype, but not many--if any--books ever do. 
 The characters: It is difficult to write despicable characters that readers care about, and it's obvious Hawkins hasn't figured out how to do it. Every character in the book--except for the kid and the weird red-headed guy who served no purpose--was despicable, unlikable, and just flat out disgusting. As a result, and because of how poorly they were written, I couldn't have cared less what happened to any one of them. 
 Pacing: It's something good books have--something this one lacked. This could have been suspenseful if it hadn't dragged on and on and on. How many times did Rachael come so very, very close to remembering what happened? How many times did the memory slip away? However many it was, it was about 75% too many. By the end, I was skimming--and not because I couldn't wait to get to the next page. I was skimming because I was tired of reading the same thing over and over and over and over. 
 Plot: Not a bad plot--just nothing all that new and exciting. And I was promised new and exciting! Also, the number of coincidences tipped over into Ridiculous Land. That many trampy women and (view spoiler)[ psycho guys living that close to each other? (hide spoiler)] And what about that red-headed guy? Can anyone figure out exactly why he was there? Shame on the editor for not axing him. 
 Structure: I am a great fan of contrived structures--when they work. The way this one jumped around between dates and characters was a bit much, and was a chore to keep straight at times. Too much of a good thing isn't a good thing. 
 All in all, this is no where near a 5-star read. Maybe, if I were feeling very generous, I could see 3-stars. But, so many things about this annoyed me--especially that red-headed man--that I can go no higher than 2-stars."
5,"*I received an ARC from the author in exchange for my honest review* 
 Let Me Know picks up where Tell Me When ends and follows the ongoing journey of Marcus and Amber as they navigate their newfound relationship and also the very real threat of the time before they got together. Their pasts. 
 Much like the previous novel, this one is not a bright and easy read. The very real issues that both of these characters struggled with in the first outing are present here and might even be heavier because we're living with a constant aftermath feeling. 
 What this book has in spades is the romance. The moments where Marcus and Amber are alone, I can feel the love so strongly it's almost as if it's rising off the pages. The way they love each other despite the past and everything they've been through, their broken bits, is just amazingly beautiful. I didn't feel as though I was being walked through their romance or force fed it. I felt like at times I was experiencing it like Amber or Marcus were. 
 But even in the most beautiful love story there has to be drama or in a sense darkness and there is that in spades here. My heart bled for Amber so much I had to walk away at times because I needed a break. Marcus too. Flashbacks, the two of them remembering on their own the horrors of what they've been through, it was heartbreaking, yet uplifting at the same time. A beautiful combination. 
 I've made no secret of the way I felt about Marcus Reid in my previous review and if it's possible, the way I felt about him in this story might have even been stronger. This is a guy whose life was not pretty. He made no excuses for it either. He owned it all. He couldn't erase his past, but he was determined to rewrite the ending and have Amber be a part of it. He is definite book boyfriend material and is almost at the very top of my list of them. Marcus might own my heart as much as he owns Ambers. 
 Amber was a strong character for me in the last story but no more so than in this one. WOW. I don't want to go into detail about what happens here but trust me, if you've read the first story, you're going to see a strength to Amber that you will be in awe of. What she endures and comes out rising above, it really is proof of the human condition. Amber is raw, Marcus is raw, but they are both so very real that at times, I wondered if I was reading reality instead of fiction. 
 I feel like one of the luckiest people in the world getting the chance to see this book before it's released. Getting to connect with these characters again was such a treat and I'm glad I took the chance when Tell Me When came out to read and review because if I hadn't, I might never have known these truly amazing characters. 
 Thank you Stina for writing such a gripping, heart wrenching yet beautifully romantic book and for letting me get the chance to be a part of reading it. I loved every minute of it. 
 Let Me Know is a definite must read, but if you haven't started the journey yet, go back and start. You won't be disappointed. This is a book designed to make you feel. You might even fall in love too. I know I did."
5,"This book was as cool as its cover. I think it deserves to be turned into a film by Tarantino - or at least Guy Ritchie. It made me laugh. It made me cry. It often made me want to throw up (I have a weak stomach for gore). 
 Read it or I will give your address to Harriet (you would have laughed at that joke if you had read it already)."
2,"Unfortunately not my thing. I stopped reading at the 9% mark. 
 Street Corner Bookers' Pile Reduction Challenge, #17 (challenger: Teccc)"
4,"Actual rating 3.5 
 By no means a profound read but that wasn't what I wanted from this. 
 I wanted slightly cheesy, I wanted a fast inbetween good mood read, I wanted a swoony boy and a cute lovestory and that's basically what I got, mix in a couple of stereotypical scenarios and a loooot of major league basebull stuff (which I enjoyed, I just didn't understand a lot of the technical things as I honestly barely have a clue about baseball) and you have Whatever Life Throws At You. 
 Jason Brody was the perfect love interest for this kind of book, very attractive (the cover helped, not gonna lie), and a bad boy turned good the right way. 
 And that's really all that matters in books like this ;) (kiddiiiing haha..kind of) 
 It contained a bit TMI in the last quarter and could have done with being a lot less graphic, this way, it seemed more NA than YA and I don't really want to give it to my little sisters haha :D 
 Also, why was everyone always so concerned about the two-year age gap between Jason and Annie??! 
 That's nothing!"
3,"3.5 stars = I liked it. It felt like more happened in this book, I actually brought this into the house to finish, but there still is very minor movement in the background arc. The thing with Rick kind of bummed me out the whole way through."
4,"Feed is one of those books that deserves a full review from me, but I just can't deliver. What can I really say about Feed anyway? I suppose that the first thing you need to know is that Feed isn't a book for everyone. It takes place in a futuristic world where zombies are a part of everyday life, but opposed to leaving it at that, Grant gives you what you really crave - world-building. Mira Grant's world-building is so detailed, precise, and complete that it can almost be hard to get through the first half of this story as it bogs down the pacing. Thus, it's really only in the second-half that the plot, centering heavily around politics and conspiracies, comes to light. 
 Personally, I found the first half of this novel really hard to get into. Not only was it too detailed, the narration was of a higher calibre than I was used to and the characters in this novel are more serious than anything else. Yet, I grew to love them and the fierce sibling dependency of Sean and Georgia Mason warmed my heart. Feed lacks romance, which was surprisingly refreshing, and throws you into a world so real that you fail to find anything lacking. 
 What really makes Feed such a popular novel though, is its plot twists. Just like those long novels that are totally worth it in their end, Feed is completely satisfying. Its layout of including blog articles written by Sean and Georgia is ingenious and frankly speaking, it's one of those stories that makes you realize how little work some other authors pour into their novels. Feed, as I mentioned before, isn't for everyone but if you love politics, world-building, and well-rounded characters, not to mention a unique plot featuring zombies, this is the book for you! 
 You can read this review and more on my blog, Ivy Book Bindings."
4,This was a fabulous book. It really inspired me to travel Eastern Europe and the near East.
5,"Wow 
 When I chose this book I wasn't sure about it. But I LOVED it and I LOVED Brooke & Caleb!"
5,Impossible to put down!
5,"I didn't know what I was getting myself into when I picked up this novel. In fact it won my TBR ""next book to read"" lottery based solely on the fact that I love purple and ""violet"" was in the title. 
 When the male lead, Caleb, was introduce, I wanted to hate him. He's depicted as a player of average looks with one unique physical trait. But if I'm being honest, if he was a real guy standing in front of me with those purple eyes I'd be his to command. Purple eye! You can't tell me that's not hot. 
 Full review soon."

3,"*I received this book through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review* 
 Duels and Deception is a sweet feel good regency novel that puts a pleasant smile on your face. 
 This novel was a lovely book. The characters were charming and relate-able while the different romances seemed to pull at the heart strings. Reading Lydia and Robert's dialogue always brought a smile to my face and the slow build of the romance was quite refreshing. While the side-characters are not mentioned too much, I found them all to be enjoyable, wishing for more scenes with poor Cassidy and finding myself quite fond of Shelley and her husband. 
 The mystery was quite mysterious, and here I must complain a bit because for about 40% of the book I had no idea where the book was heading or what it was to be about. I had to read the summary to understand, which lowers the quality of the book. Eventually I got the gist of it-- who kidnapped her and why?! Once the mystery was introduced I had fun guessing who the main villain could be. 
 Another thing I'd like to comment on, Lydia starts the book out imagining shadows or people following her... I feel like this was never addressed in the end especially since Robert checked a shrubbery for her to no avail. I was beginning to think there was a supernatural element (lol) only for it to drop off, so I am still confused about that. 
 I wasn't entirely hooked on this book, but that fault lies with me and my preferences, and I do think this is an enjoyable book that others may find well done. I would recommend this to readers who enjoy historical fiction, details, really getting a feel for the life of the time, and those who want a break from insta-love."
5,"I actually ended up pre-ordering this book -- something I've only done once before in my life -- and then I put off reading this for a while because I was afraid that it wouldn't live up to my expectations from the first book. Now that I've finished the book, I realize I had nothing to worry about. 
 This book is amazing. 
 I love these characters. I loved Cinder and Kai from the start. I was worried that the additions of Thorne and Scarlet would be hard to get used to, but it wasn't. Thorne might actually be my new favorite character. He's so full of himself but in a charming way. I loved watching him and Cinder get to know each other in a non-romantic way. Thorne was a great addition to the cast. I was also super happy to see the return of another beloved character from the first book, but I won't mention that character by name just in case someone's worried about spoilers. 
 I didn't like the character of Scarlet as much as I loved Cinder, but I definitely enjoyed reading about her. It was fun to see how someone else reacted to the events of the first book. Not that this book goes back in time a lot. That's actually something I think Meyer did really well - she summarized most of the information in such a way that it seemed more like the characters were reflecting on the past and less like she was summarizing the information for our sake. 
 Wolf was an odd character. I was never really sure what to make of him. I can't really talk about his character without getting into spoilers, but I will say that he was part of what knocked this book down a star. 
 The other reason this book doesn't have 10 stars is because I was able to put it down for a couple of months. At first, I stopped reading this book because a library book came in, and I wanted to read that one before I read the book that I owned. However, the mere fact that I was willing to stop reading this book and then didn't go back to it right away says something about the beginning of this book. This is actually something that was true with CINDER, as well. It's not that the beginning was boring (because it's not at all), but it didn't make me feel compelled to read. It's sort of like an average slice of pizza - I'll keep eating because it's delicious and I love pizza, but it won't win any awards for being the best pizza ever. 
 Okay, that's a weird analogy, but whatever. That's how I would describe the beginning of this book. I stopped around page 150 the first time. Once I picked it up again, though, I couldn't put it down. Maybe I stopped reading at exactly the wrong moment. Maybe I just wasn't in the right headspace the first time. I don't know. All I know is that by the time I got to page 200, I didn't want to stop reading. I had to keep reading to figure out how the two stories would intertwine, and then I had to read to see how they were going to get out of their respective problems. 
 Marissa Meyer is one of my favorite novelists that I discovered last year. She writes great characters, and she takes fairy tale retellings to a whole new level. There are two more books in the series, and I can't wait to read them both. This is definitely one author that will be on my pre-order list for the rest of time. Of course, it doesn't hurt that she started as a NaNoWriMo Overachiever (even if I'm not sure if she embraced that title or not). :)"
3,"Not quite as entertaining as the first Nathaniel Cade book, but still a fun read. A number of seemingly random plot lines detailing past events all come together by the end."
3,"Allie and Zayvion have only spent a few days recovering from near death in the previous book, when an attempt is made on their lives from an unexpected quarter - the bodyguard of their missing leader Sedra. After a narrow escape, Allie and Zayvion are determined to question a prisoner in the Authority's high security prison, and things go wrong when they discover he is possessed by the long-dead legend Leander and manages to escape. Monk ups the ante in this sixth installment with the introduction of Leander, and throws in a nice twist in the end of another action-packed adventure. While I find myself getting tired of Allie and Zay occasionally, the development of the characters of Shamus and Terrion more than makes up for that. Though this series won't find a place on my keeper shelf, the author continues to hold my attention and pique my curiosity enough to keep reading."
3,"i'm sort of torn about this book. 
 i really enjoyed the writing and atmosphere. the characters were really interesting too. it was mysterious and magical, but i also like how maybe people hold onto made up stories in order to cope through traumatic experiences? 
 but also the ambiguity of elsie was confusing... 
 sooOOooooOoo idek...maybe overall i like the idea of this book. i liked where moira fowley-doyle was going with this, but the execution was lacking when it came to plot and deeper character development. 
 this is pretty much 3 stars --maybe 3.25 stars. i liked it even with its flaws and i think i'll definitely be reading more of her work."
5,"The best of the series after the first one, in my opinion. Book 2 was heavy in politics. Book 3 delved more into ancient civilizations and other cultures, but still was heavy with politics. Not to say that this one wasn't, but I think it was balanced with more adventure, science, intrigue, action, and, yes, romance. Isabella's refusal to admit her fondness to Suhail was nearly infuriating, but her relationship with the reader is so intimate and consistent that I could forgive her for it. I am also FINALLY relieved to find out how she received her most current title in this volume. 
 I continue to enjoy the obvious comparisons between races and cultures in this book to real live ones, as well as the observations of women's struggles during Victorian-like society. What I especially like is that Isabella is a strong protagonist, but not necessarily modern. She resents the restrictions on her sex, but it is clear she is a woman of her age and not from the 21st century; hooray for continued realism! 
 The drive to successfully breed dragons was an excellent plot, especially as it tied through from previous volumes. I loved revisiting the Draconean civilizations, and am pleased to see their importance grow in, what I suspect will be an excellent climax in the final book. I cannot wait to see how this series will end."
5,"She walked to where he stood, where the fire met the water. He took her hand and they both looked out into the abyss of it. 
 I saw this book floating around some bestseller lists since last year and had several recommend it but never got around to it until this year. I'm so glad I did. This is one of those books that leaves an emotional mark. A book that, say in 10 years, you look back and can remember exactly how this book made you feel. 
 Yaa Gyasi's debut novel is brilliant, beautiful, and masterful. Spanning multiple generations of the descendants of two, separated at birth, half-sisters in Africa. Their lives take very different directions leading us through the slave-wars in Africa to slavery in America. From the discovery and boom of cocoa plant to segregation in America. Showing us two vastly different countries through the eyes of these people was done perfectly. 
 We had one side that stayed in Africa. We had the other side that came straight to America. This side hit a little close to home, living in Birmingham, Alabama. The very last descendants finally meet in America, which I'll say I probably saw coming. But them traveling to Africa together, bringing the whole story full circle, made this book's title, ""Homegoing"", a perfect fit. 
 ""The white man's god is just like the white man. He thinks he is the only god, just like the white man thinks he is the only man."" 
 I'll be the first to admit my privilege and ignorance in the cultures explored in this book and I won't say this book made me better but it definitely opened my eyes and got me to do a lot more research about these cultures and perspectives. Not only did this give us multiple perspectives from multiple generations and cultures, it gave more than one gender. 
 ""Too dark,"" he repeated. ""Jazzing's only for the light girls."" ""I saw a man dark as midnight walk in with a trombone."" ""I said girls, honey. If you were a man, maybe."" 
 Lastly, I'll end this with the most powerful message to me personally from this book and one that should be remembered: 
 ""We believe the one who has the power. He is the one who gets to write the story. So when you study history, you must always ask yourself, Whose story am I missing? Whose voice was suppressed so that this voice could come forth? Once you have figured that out, you must find that story too. From there, you begin to get a clearer, yet still imperfect, picture."" 
 Read this book."
3,"Not terribly bad, just wasn't as interested as I thought I should have been, given the hype. I liked the characters (with the exception of Andie, who, for some reason, appeared a little one-dimensional), and Andie's relationship with her father was wonderful to read, but the story didn't suck me in as much as the characters did."
4,"The Runaways got caught in the middle of the civil war, the young avengers came to help. Maria Hill releases Noh Varr to capture them but when two teams work together, they are unstoppable. 
 I don't like the art style in this volume but it was fun to see justice being served."
4,"The Sea of Monsters wasn't my absolute favorite of the series, but it was still quite good! 
 I don't know why, but for some reason the second book in any series I read is never my favorite. I'm not sure what the deal is with that. 
 For instance, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is my LEAST favorite. I don't know what it is about the book. I do enjoy the movie, but I still know that the movie also is my least favorite (and most watched... I've seen that movie more times than I could count. I think because it came out at a very pivotal time in my life - age 15/16!). 
 I did not see The Sea of Monsters movie, so after the first book ended, everything was my imagination. I do know there were some complaints and that also there were some parts of other books added into the second movie. That is part of the reason I didn't watch it before reading this. Now, I'll probably watch it just to see what the hell people are complaining about. 
 Let's talk about the book. 
 (view spoiler)[ 
 What I liked about this book was that it was hilarious. Grover pretending to be a woman instead of a goat was priceless to me. It was super age-appropriate and fun and a clever way to not have to marry the awful giant. Percy and Clarisse, always fighting with each other, was a source of endless entertainment. Tyson and the Hippocampus Rainbow made me want to jump of a cliff because it was funny and cute. He didn't know any better. That made it all the more fun. Tantalus, although of course the antagonist in this book, was super funny. The image of a hamburger hopping around out of his reach while he is trying to speak about something serious had me giggling. Just imagine that! 
 I loved Tyson. I wish he were in this book even more (and I say that because at times he does disappear, but it pushes the plot along, so I forgive you Mr. Riordan) and also in the other books. Especially in the other books. 
 Clarisse is super annoying - whatever that's fine, she redeems herself in the books to come. 
 I liked that this story revolved around the golden fleece. I barely passed Mythology class in high school, so do I remember any of this stuff? No. But I was reminded of the stories in a way that is easy to understand. Mr. Riordan doesn't make it difficult. I do know these are for young readers, and I am not a young reader, but I get easily confused / distracted, so reading young readers is right up my alley :) 
 My favorite part of this whole damn book was the very last page, where the golden fleece worked ""too well"" and Thalia came back to life. I was impressed with the plot twist (...I consider that a plot twist at least) and I couldn't actually wait for Titan's Curse. I started to read it immediately. 
 Side note: I think the cruise ship thing is weird. That's just my opinion. 
 (hide spoiler)] 
 In all, I enjoyed this book and after I finished it I couldn't wait to get to the next book."
1,"I hate the ignorance in this book. Do NOT write a romance novel where two hot white British people fall in love in a country that is being colonized by the British, and make their suffering seem worse than all others. 
 The writing was pretty well done, however the story might have been something I really enjoyed had it not been set in India, or any country that was under the British rule at that moment. It would have helped the author's case had she actually involved the culture of India and Indian people in the story, rather than to just use them as background noise. What bothered me is that for a couple moments, it shed India in a bad light. Apparently Indian rebels were killing British women, which causes our heroine to go into hiding. The hero tells her he'll come back for her, but thinks she's dead so he leaves her India without knowing. Basically, it was because of the Indians rebelling against the British that our couple gets separated. Don't talk about the hurt the British caused the Indians, don't talk about how much the Indian's suffered during the 1800s, don't talk about the natives hurt and suffering during the colonization. Just use that as a plot devise so our readers can feel bad about the heroine being left alone in a country she doesn't know with ""dangerous"" people. Does Duran need a history lesson? Does she not know it was the British who invaded India? Does she not know it was the Indian people being massacred and killed at the hands of the British? It seems she does actually know, but still managed to find a way to use all of that as a big prop for her story. Btw, making the hero 1/4 Indian does NOT give you a pass. Nice try tho. 
 What's worse is that the author doesn't give us any descriptions of India. All she talks about is how it's a beautiful and rich country, but doesn't actually give any descriptions. YOU'RE IN INDIA FOR FUCKS SAKE, TALK ABOUT IT, TELL ME EVERYTHING, TALK ABOUT THE CULTURE! No?! Just want to use it as an aesthetic for your story?! ...well okay then. *stabbing you with hard glares* 
 At one point, when the heroine escapes India and goes back to Britain, she draws pictures illustrating the struggle of the Indians and the British in India, and all these white people praise her for her awareness as if they actually know what was like. Duran talks about all this as if both the Indians AND the British suffered equally during the colonization of the Indian continent. UHM...I'M PRETTY SURE IT WAS THE INDIANS WHO SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL MORE IN THEIR OWN HOME AND COUNTRY THAT WAS INVADED AND STRIPPED APART SO STFU AND GO BACK AND DO SOME RESEARCH. 
 Sorry, but as an Indian, as a person who actually did her best to understand the struggle of the British Invasion, I cannot even bring myself to give this book a 1 star. Unfortunately, negative stars aren't a thing. If you want to write a book about a struggle you've never gone through, then at least do some research, ask people who DID go through it for some insight so you don't look the ignorant fool. Like I said, the romance and the story was actually good, it was the setting and timing of the story that the story took place in that made my skin crawl."
5,"Review first appeared on www.sparrowsflysouth.blogspot.co.uk 
 I absolutely loved this book. 
 I'll just say that straight up. It was utterly brilliant. From the prologue I was gripped; I read all of it, nearly 500 pages, in about 3 days, which says something (I can take months to read a book). It was just that good. 
 I was, of course, mentally slapping myself throughout at ever having doubted JKR. I recognised a lot from the well-loved Harry Potter series: the clean, interesting writing, that neither wallows in unnecessary description nor panders to the modern desire for a short-sentenced, journalistic style. The three-dimensional characters, each with their own story. The perfect plot. 
 JK Rowling is a wonderful storyteller. That's why we all love Harry so much; the plot of each book picks you up and carries you away on its inexorable tide. The Cuckoo's Calling was exactly the same: this incredible narrative, with a plot that folded out from strand and strand of the storyline. I don't read much crime fiction so I'm not well-versed in the genre, but I'm sure this was a top-end example. It kept me guessing until the very end! 
 I loved the way in which the past and the present entwined in the story. On the one hand, we see the plot through Robin's eyes and are caught up in the here and now, with the investigation of Landry's death. But we are also learning, slowly, more and more about Strike, who has a mysterious past that is revealed bit by bit. Even now, at the end of this first book in the series, there is a lot left unsaid. 
 The characterisation was, frankly, perfect. Robin was supremely likeable; she was smart and intuitive, and she had an enthusiasm for the job, a secret joy in the detective work. Cormoran Strike, meanwhile, was an absolutely brilliant character - one of the best I've read this year. He was stoical; he kept going, not complaining about the demons looming from the past. He didn't fit the stereotype of the cool, sharp, BBC Sherlock, James Bond-esque detective/spy; he was a fresh and excellent character. I loved him. 
 The book left me: engrossed in its world, with an intensity that I'd expect from a fantasy novel; slavering for the next one (The Silkworm); and amazed that I'd waited so long to read it. You know those Best Books lists we make at the end of the year? The Cuckoo's Calling will be featuring. It has cured me of my JKR hangover. No, it wasn't Harry. But nothing is Harry. The Cuckoo's Calling was gripping, superbly characterised and full of the plot twists and turns of a master. An absolutely top notch read."
5,"5 Stars: 
 I read this book in one sitting. I could not put it down. Defiantly one of, if not the best fantasy book I have ever read. It is an utterly cold novel about social acceptance. Every page of The Giver was spellbinding and captivating. However very interesting the story it is still a little confusing. A world without colors, loves, pain, and so on. This world is interesting yet, scary. I consider this book to be among the best books ever published. Found in the children or young readers sections your local library I would recommend everyone give this a read, you will not be disappointed."
5,"I am simply in awe of Geraldine Brooks. I read ""March"" several years ago, then ""People of the Book"" more recently. I finally convinced myself to go back and read ""Year of Wonders"", her first novel, and from page one, I was blown away. Her use of language is magnificent, and the characters and plot are unforgettable. In a nutshell, ""Year of Wonders"" tells the tale of a small, isolated English village hit by an onslaught of the Plague in 1665 - 1666. Main character Anna narrates the horrors of the disease, the grief and suffering of the dying and those who survive, and the shocking decision made by the villagers to quarantine themselves and let God determine their fate. We see almost first-hand the desperation to survive, the search for easy scapegoats, the deceptions and scams employed by some, and the dedication and self-sacrifice of those who stay to care for the afflicted. I recommend this book highly."
3,"Just One Day I'm not sure if it's these things or something else, but it makes that kiss, which I get was just platonic - a friendly, cheek handshake thing - feel momentous. A kiss from all of Paris. 
 Just One Day was a new kind of read for me. While I thought I would like it more than it did, that doesn't mean that it didn't hit me in a good way. From reading the synopsis, I thought it would be more like Anna and the French Kiss. I freely admit that. And while it was little to nothing like it, I still enjoyed it for what it was: a good read. 
 I liked the adventure of going to Paris for just one day - I love all books with travel, so it wasn't a stretch that I would like a trek across Europe. It all felt very romantic, even though I did question Willem's motives a couple of times. It wasn't hard, with Allyson/Lulu being kind of scared of his motives as well. 
 In fact, Allyson herself wasn't so bad. I actually ended up liking her more than I thought I would. At first, she comes off as a little uptight, but as you get to know her you realize that she's actually a sweet girl. She's just a little bit too safe, a bit scared. She was unsure. 
 Which is why Willem really balanced her out - if anything, he was overly sure of himself. He was also very compulsive, and honestly just a little bit crazy. In a good way, of course. I think it takes a strong person to travel around a country by themselves. 
 There's also something romantic about that, but let's not go there. I guess I just find travel of any kind romantic. The story itself was romantic, but I also feel like it was very nostalgic - and I was slightly disappointed when Allyson came back from Paris in pieces. She went through a bit of depression, and it was sad. I also didn't really care for the ending - it was depressing too. I've ordered Just One Year, to see if we can get a happy ending - but I'm not going to lie. 
 The end of this one just really made me want to cry. Even for days after, when I glanced at the book - all I wanted to do was cry. All in all, Just One Day was a good read. Depressing and romantic - but you've really got to be in a mood to enjoy that, don't you think?"
1,"I very rarely ever do not finish but the opportunity costs of continuing this pretentious piece of #$%* with its little boy humor...The year of the adult depend undergarments...wink, wink, snicker, snicker... are just too great. No point, rapidly becoming dated, self indulgent...I'll stop here..The fact the book makes a list entitled Hipster Life Recommendations says it all."
4,"So, on the one hand, I'm kind of mad at myself for waiting so long to read this book. It's been on my shelf for ages! On the other hand, I have to wait until OCTOBER for the next one and that is so unbelievably frustrating. Ilona Andrews definitely has another great series here and I really don't want to wait for the rest of it!"
3,"First off, I hate stream of consciousness. As I lay dying is such a simple story, they're takin' some chick to be buried. The fact that it is in stream of consciousness makes such a simple tale that much harder to understand. The Handmaid's Tale is a more confusing story, with a location none of us is used to, so using stream of consciousness makes it that much more annoying. 
 Then I wanted more from the story happening in the present. I don't usually get upset when (view spoiler)[the ending is left in the air (hide spoiler)], but I feel like we could have used an extra 200 pages. And maybe not giving us a look into the world outside World of Gilead or the Underground Women's Railroad puts us more in the character, since she her self was unsure, but dammit, I want to know what life is like leaving Gilead."
3,"Honestly speaking, you could make a cheesecake with this story. Some parts were pure cheese, but others were just so sweet. I have decided I'm going to ignore the former and appreciate the latter. (view spoiler)[Like how for example he called her his home, or how he took care of her when she twisted her ankle. That was just... *sigh* (hide spoiler)] 
 It was fun to read. Egomaniac has definitely had its moments. 
 I like how mature the characters are. It's crazy, getting this excited about the maturity of characters, but somehow contemporary romance novels don't have a lot of that. Adults behaving as if they're going through puberty or worse, as if they didn't even hit puberty yet. The characters were actually a lot like the ones from Keeland's other novel I've read, but I don't seem to mind that. What can I say, maturity works for me. 
 I did mind, however, (view spoiler)[when Drew took away the choice from Emerie and broke up with her when he had to move to Georgia, under the excuse of ""protecting her from pain"". How is this still a thing?!?!?!?!?! (hide spoiler)] Thankfully, the drama wasn't too drawn out, at least not between them. For all you drama lovers out there, there's still plenty to go around. 
 (view spoiler)[Also, I am no expert in law, but from what I've gathered from various movies and series and whatnot, if the parent who has custody of the child remarries, then shouldn't the other parent be relieved from paying alimony? Or is this a state thing? (hide spoiler)] 
 So yeah, if you're interested, I'd say go for it. It's fun to read and it won't insult your intelligence. Go, Vi!"
4,"In this Single mom meets a cowboy MMA fighter, Stacked Up kind of gives off the feeling of a new and very adult twist to the FOOTLOOSE-ish plot. 
 Penny was working two jobs to support her young daughter. Penny ran away from her rich, disapproving family to keep her daughter and her daughter means everything to Penny. 
 Travis is a carefree cowboy with an MMA career about to explode in the national media spotlight. He takes a serious liking to Penny. He actively pursues her and convinces her to live a little...not knowing what responsibilities she is carrying. 
 There is a ready to order family just waiting for our couple to comes to terms with their hang ups. Penny is the opposite of Travis' mother. Penny is in hiding from her over bearing family that wants to control her life. Then there is the adorable daughter that ties them all together. 
 I could have done without the Evangelical stereo-typing. Every time that came up I inwardly cringed, forunately the overall vibe of the story prevailed. 
 The vibe of this story was its utter cute appeal. The flat out sweet and tenderness just had me smiling while reading. I attribute this to how the author has these characters open up and share their pasts. The openness of the characters eliminates that pesky second guessing and that bothersome ""I'd just wish they'd talk to each other"", because they really do share.

 ""I just felt that by commenting on that in any real way, it would be tacit approval of it as a legitimate debate, which it isn't.

 Oh, wow. Someone is out to break my heart. 
 And it worked. 
 I, and everyone else in the Firefly-fandom I reckon, love Shepherd Book. He is, aside from being a wonderful character, also the type of religious person I wish we saw more of. The type who found peace and strength with God, someone who doesn't try to convert you, but try to help you find peace as well. 
 And how did he become this person? This character we love so much? What happened to make him so patient, so understanding, so mysteriously good at kicking people's kneecaps in? 
 You will soon know. 
 This book does an amazing job with his story. Anyone who watched Firefly wondered what it was about Shepherd Book. WHO he really was. And this answers all those questions in a more than satisfactory manner. You needn't have worried, Zack - this is perfect (seriously, you manage to do all of that convincingly in 56 pages = skills). 
 It made me cry, too. Not a lot, but a little. 
 Of all the characters, he is probably the one with the greatest burden. And it makes everything that comes later - his time with the Serenity-crew - much more moving; to think that this man, who has been so lost, so utterly alone, finally found a place he could belong. 
 I might be fortunate, though, because I never made up any definitive background story for Shepherd Book on my own (mostly because that never ends well when something like this comes out). So where others might get disappointed, I only relished in finally knowing. Good for me! 
 Shepherd was dear to me before, but he's even more dear to me now. 
 I loved this."

2,"A sigh of relief escaped me as I turned to the last page of this insufferable drag. 
 SF being one of my favorite genres, I persevered only because of Dune's universal acclaim as a classic, but frankly, this book was boring as hell. 
 For this reason, it took me almost a year to finish this. It wasn't worth it and I can't recommend it. 
 The only reason it gets two stars instead of one is for the intricate world-building that probably got it some of its fame."

3,"I would love to see her in real life all, glowy and ethereal... I don't know what to expect from the next book. The title suggests the total opposite, obviously. A Want So Wicked. God!! Psyched!"
4,"I was weeding in the YA section at the library the other day (books, not plants) and came across this series. I didn't remember it, although I must have ordered it. It has quotes from three big-name authors on the back cover, one of whom expressed the expectation that it would be ""the next Hunger Games"" (WHY do people do that?!), and several of my friends have read it, and it's mostly gotten good reviews, and I've never heard of it. (I mean, beyond picking it out at some point and ordering it, which I must have done.) So I decided to take the first book home with me to see. 
 I liked it. Nathan has an interesting voice. I like the way he is presented and also presents himself. I like that he can barely read but he can communicate through drawing. I like that he can't sleep inside but has to be in nature. I like the twist that although he is the kid everyone expected to go bad (and he does live up to their expectations, almost against his will), there is also this element of witchery. It keeps you guessing. I'm going to continue with the series."
4,"I think people need to realise: 
 1) This book is in play format, and is not a novel. 
 2) This is BASED on a story by JK and TWO other people. 
 3) As this wasn't written by JK, its not going to be a Harry Potter story like the ones we all know and love. There will be continuity and characterisation issues. Just take a deep breath and accept this. 
 Don't get me wrong, I was one of those people that grew up reading (and loving) Harry Potter. As soon as each book came out I would rush to the book store, eagerly awaiting my copy, and devour it within a week (I'm a slow reader). 
 It's been almost 10 years since I read HP and the Deathly Hallows, and I haven't re-read any of the Harry Potter novels since then. Maybe this is why I can distance myself a bit and enjoy the story for what it is. 
 It was nostalgic, I loved the relationship between Albus (Harry's son) and Scorpius (Draco's son), and I can imagine it will make a great stage play (here's hoping it will come to Australia one day). 
 Without giving anything away, a lot of the plot centred around happenings of the 4th novel, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, which was my favourite HP novel. It was really nice remembering my feelings when I first read that book as a 14 year old. 
 The old gang was back, and I really enjoyed seeing how their relationships grew, especially Draco and Harry. I never liked Harry and Ginny as a pairing, but they worked well enough here. 
 Anyway, I'm not an amazing review writer, but this was a 4/5 star for me. I, along with many others would have preferred this as a novel, but the play format didn't bother me too much."
5,Who knew a novella about zombies and corn with a unicorn on the front could be so philosophical?
5,"I had goose bumps from head to toe. I might cry a bit, the onion kind of cry, uncontrollable and ugly. While Celaena could easily hold the book together by herself from page one till finish, teaming her up with Captain Chaol Westfall made me searched for a bigger word for perfection. 
 While my contemporary genre suffered a big slump lately, the sun and the stars have been shining oh-so-very brightly in the Fantasy department. After a strong Stolen Songbird, followed by Throne of Glass, and now this, I was thinking of converting myself to a YA Fantasy worshipper forever. 
 There were so many feels for this book. My simple words won't be enough to describe them all since I'm still struggling to find a stronger synonym for perfect. 
 I heart Chaol Westfall like mad, and looking at the way book 2 ended, I am bracing myself for book 3 cos whatever coming won't be pretty... 
 Awesome, awesome story, Sarah J. Maas! 
 Sincerely, 
 Your devoted CC (Celaena-Chaol) admirer"
5,"My first 5-star-book of the year. 
 It was incredibly well written (and translated as I read the French version). 
 This book is definitely a jewel, full of poetry, emotions, suspense, and outstanding characters. 
 It was absolutely brilliant !"
2,"Actual rating: 1.5 
 There isn't much to say about this particular novel, except that I feel as though I've wasted a considerable amount of time reading it. 
 To be more specific, this book features a 'story-within-a-story': On the one hand, we have Susan, the reader in this instance, reading from a manuscript given to her by her ex-husband, Edward, of 25 years' past. The manuscript in question is titled Nocturnal Animals, which involves a family man, Tony, and his wife and daughter being terrorized on the road by three ruffians (although, the ""terrorizing"" happens so early on, and it being the most thrilling part of the entire novel, makes everything else pretty lackluster from then-on-out). Susan's story is the weaker of the two; her daily musings on home life with her second husband, Arnold, as well as the children, is seemingly mundane and far too introspective to be interesting. She talks in vague circles about Arnold's unfaithfulness, and her duties as mother, wife, and woman. She is consistently unlikable (As is Arnold, the cock!). In fact, you will not find a single character in this story worthy of being liked. She reflects often on her past relationship and eventual marriage to Edward: what led them into it, what drove them out of it, etc. It's all fairly commonplace. Susan would say something about the reason to their divorce, but all the while eluding to something (the way she made it sound) much darker than a simple case of infidelity... which it eventually turned out to be. Now, that isn't much of a spoiler. It's blatantly obvious from the fact that she is re-married at the start of the book that unfaithfulness was a catalyst, I was just hoping for something MORE. 
 Moving on to the story within, Nocturnal Animals, again, there isn't much to say except that this one fizzled out real fast. Out of 25-odd chapters within Edward's manuscript, the most exciting and suspenseful part happens within the very first few chapters. Tony & Susan really shouldn't be marketed as a thriller. It's rather quite boring. After the initial shock and awe of the opening chapters of Nocturnal Animals, Tony's story devolved into a messy puddle of grief, depression, melancholy, revenge, and redemption (but the latter two descriptors remain wholly exaggerated in the end). In fact, it got so boring, I actually started to prefer Susan's portions more than Tony's story. 
 And that's exactly when this book kicked me in the balls: the ending sputtered and died. There is no foreseeable resolution to Susan's story. It's just... ""blah"". Same goes for Tony's finale: I felt nothing. The only reason I'm keeping this book from an official, full one-star is due to the way it's written. I've read some people being put off by the writing style, but it worked for me. There are choppy and fragmented sentences galore, but I love short, cut and to-the-point as much as I love flowery prose and free verse. 
 This certainly isn't a terrible book. I'm just disappointed I chose to read it over the other wonderful things I could've picked up instead. I am, however, excited to see the film adaptation that was recently released. That is the main reason I hurried to read this one (although, it has been on my wish-list for many years). And maybe, just maybe, this will be that rare instance in which the film is better than the book."
2,"I found myself flipping through much of the demon realm content. I think all the events were so over powered I wasn't particularly invested in how Corine was going to survive. I'm also pretty disappointed in the ending, Aguirre seems to have gotten into a ""rinse and repeat"" cycle with the men in this series. I'm predicting Kel will be back in book 5. 
 Full review at What I Read Today."
5,A childhood favorite that will always have a place in my heart. . .
4,"Mockingjay finally answers the questions that built up in the previous two books and concludes nicely. I was a little disappointed--I knew there would be no actual Hunger Games in this book, but without them some of the fire and intensity of the previous two volumes seemed to be missing. It seemed to move so fast that I sometimes felt overwhelmed, like Katniss, and wished for the straightforward action of the other books. 
 Overall, it provided an excellent end to the series, but I still think that some of the characters weren't as well-defined as they were previously and that maybe the book needed to be little bit longer to provide a completely conclusive ending."
5,"Satisfying. Much better than the first book. More original, and I love Cia- even if she seems like she is just so brilliant (where did she learn all that, when others didn't learn it?) in a place where everyone is brilliant. She's changed so much, lost so much innocence, and yet she still values all life and retains the core of who she is. She's flawed, she's scared and does not deny it, but she steps up. The plot twist at the end left me gasping- we were almost there. But everything ties in perfectly- I knew it wasn't going to be that simple anyway- and I can't wait to read the next book."
3,"It's more a 3.5 since there were some things I really liked, but than there were some that let me thinking more in the lines of meh. 
 I like Sam but I was not a big fan of Jared - I know he had to be portrayed as a sexist prick - hence the title - but that didn't stop me wanting to smack him senseless time to time again. He was hot though and the smutty scenes almost made me overlook his sexist remarks..almost. 
 What I really enjoyed was the premise of vampire classes with awesome abilities. Yap really enjoyed those and the description of their battles. More action please! 
 But again I wished that the author could hint more than the fact that there were 3 classes: the powerful, the beautifully and the boring human alike with an aphrodisiac bite. I hope in the future books there'll be more details in regards with their history and the characteristics of each class and their abilities. 
 I also liked Luther and I was a little bit sad that he didn't had many appearances in the book, but hopefully some insight will be provided in the future ones. Since he was this really cool really old vampire (really really old since he was compared to Gandalf) and had this amazing ability I just wished to know more of his history - how did he end up as Adviser and his history with Antonio. What can I say I loved Gandalf. :))) 
 So yes I'm going to continue with the series, but I don't expect to fall in love. I'm curious in regards with Evan story and I wish maybe Antonio will find his happiness along the way, but I have a feeling the next stories will be centered around the squad."
5,"RATING: 
 Rick Riordan is a genius. 
 I finished this book with a smile on my face, just like with the other two books. Friendship and family are two of the most prominent themes in this series and I think lessons like those are important for books that cater to younger readers. I find that these books are not only fun, but also teaches the readers something valuable. I'd most definitely recommend this series to my daugher when she's older. :) 
 But really, this series is only getting better. I did loved Sea of Monsters a bit more, but that doesn't mean I didn't think this one wasn't good. There were just very minor things that I preferred on the second book than here. 
 The Friday before winter break, my mom packed me an overnight bag and a few deadly weapons and took me to my new boarding school. 
 This first line really made me giggle. I mean how many moms would pack their children ""deadly weapons"", right? LOL. 
 Anyways, going back. 
 Percy, Annabeth, and Thalia were dropped off by Percy's mom on their new boarding school, Westover Hall. Which they said looked like an evil knight's castle. It seems that Grover had told them to come to Westover Hall because there were two other Half-bloods. They were trying to retrieve them but they ran into trouble and they lost Annabeth. *ooooppssss* 
 And before anyone could react, the monster, with Annabeth still on his back, leaped over the cliff and tumbled into the darkness. 
 Artemis and her hunters came to help them, but they couldn't get to Annabeth. Percy and the others need to get back to Camp Half Blood to get the Di Angelo kids to safety and find a way to get Annabeth back. And to Percy's dismay, he wasn't picked for the quest to save Annabeth. 
 "" 
 Thalia would not have been my first choice to go on this quest. She's too impetous. She acts without thinking. She is too sure of herself."" 
 ""Would you have chosen me?"" 
 ""Frankly, no,"" he said. ""You and Thalia are much alike."" 
 But we all know that this is a Percy Jackson book. There is no way in hell he wouldn't be on that quest. And sure enough, he gets to join the trip. And there, they find out more about the chaos that Luke and Kronos is about to unleash. 
 I don't think there is really much to say about these characters because I still really like them. I didn't find any problems with the main characters and also with the antagonists. I really like Luke's character because he is the type of villain that you want to change. I want him to change. I hope I get to see his character change in the last two books. 
 Percy was still good. I still liked his character. Annabeth was not in this book too much which is a bummer because she's my favorite. Thalia was.. well.. annoying at time. Grover was still Grover. 
 The additional Gods were a lot of fun to read about. There was my favorite Greek God Apollo. I was kind of wondering when we might see him. There was Artemis and her Hunters. I can't believe I'll be saying this, but Diyonisus wasn't so bad. Haha. 
 - I still liked the characters. The newer ones were a good addition. 
 - I liked how the characters weren't invincible. This made them real in my opinion. These kids were demigods, they are not immortal. So, they could die. And what these kids faced, it would be super unrealistic for none of them to die. Someone should. And someone did. *ooopss* Don't worry. It's not really a spoiler. It's part of the prophecy. Hehe. You guys just have to figure out who dies. 
 - Percy's relationship with his mom is one of the things I liked about this book. I liked how she never gets disregarded. Her opinion still matters to him. 
 - The writing is still as entertaining. It's super engaging and fresh. It's still unlike anything I've ever read before. I often wonder if Rick is really an adult because of the way he writes. He really captures mostly how a person Percy's age thinks and acts. 
 - The villains were very villainy. I felt that they were really a threat to the kids and to the Gods too. 
 - I didn't like how Annabeth was missing on a large chunk of this book. I did not appreciate that at all Rick!!! Annabeth is like my soul sister, I did not appreciate not reading about her. 
 - I had a bit of a hard time connecting with Thalia at first. We what happened to her and how she lived from the last book. There wasn't any time to connect with her at all since she was there on the first chapter like she wasn't a tree on the last book. 
 - There were lines on the first few chapters that sounded a lot like what Dumbledore from Harry Potter would say. 
 I am obsessed with this series! I loved Greek Myth. I probably have read every Greek myth there ever is (that might be an exagerration but I really love Greek Myth). I've also read quite a few Greek myth retellings but this is by far the most fun, enjoyable and creative of the bunch. I love Percy and would definitely read more of Rick Riordan's books. 
 I highly recommend this series!!! 
 If you haven't picked this series up, what are you doing with your life? :D 
 Read it. Read it. Read it!"
3,"#1 Kate Daniels series 
 This book combines fantasy (magic) with paranormal (vamps, were's of every imaginable type), plus the odd Impala Worm and flying snakes (YES!). 
 I liked the paranormal aspects and the writing, but I'm not that big a fan of magic/fantasy (magic or enchanted swords, etc.), so I quit reading around page 75. 
 Those who enjoy both fantasy/magic and paranormal will probably enjoy this book tho."
3,"TL:DR - The Girl on the Train is getting 3 stars from me because the horrible characters and situations made me want to finish this book. Otherwise, I hated it. 
 This is one of those books you read because everyone's reading it. When I picked up a hardback copy of this I hadn't seen the film - not even the trailer, had managed to avoid all the spoilers - I didn't have the faintest idea of what it was about. 
 I was quite intrigued at the beginning. I was interested in the how, when and why of the relationship between Rachel and Jess & Jason and it was probably that which saved this book from DNF zero stars. 
 You see, for reasons that I still don't have, this book made me so angry. I got halfway through and thought ""My God, I hate these people, I hate the situation they are in, I hate Cathy, I hate the red haired guy and I hate the setting"". I think only little Evie was the only character that I didn't feel disgusted with. 
 So I put the book down. At that point I was seriously considering not finishing it, which for someone who can honestly count on her own two hands the amount of books she DNF, was a huge thing. I even admitted it to social media - The Book Devourer has found a book that she doesn't want to finish :O 
 In the three or so days that came after, I couldn't settle with any book for long. I got another chapter through Too Close to Home, read the preview for After You in the back of my copy of Me Before You and nearly picked up A Game of Thrones again (after all The Winds of Winter is coming soon guys, right???). 
 It was clear to me that The Girl on the Train was the reason I couldn't stick at any other book. It had needled it's way into my head and was staying put until I finished it. And am I happy that I did? Well yes, kind of. Part of me wishes I'd never read it, but the other part knows that however much I hated the characters I hate leaving stories unfinished even more."
2,"I am pretty gosh-darn agitated. What started off (and continued to be throughout a large part of the book) as a beautiful and haunting tale of a reincarnation and a love that spans multiple lifetimes ended in possibly the most unsatisfying way--apart from both characters dying and not coming back. Which actually might have been better because then there would have been some sense of closure. 
 Up until Daniel and Lucy acutally connected, I thought the book was fantastic. In fact, I would have eagerly given the book 4 stars soley based on the writing up until that point. The Constance parts were especially exquisite. 
 But once Lucy started falling for Joaquin's ploy it felt like the story went flat. I didn't believe for an instant that Lucy's character would behave in the manner that she did. And then Daniel and Lucy's behavior later--unbelievable! At that point, I stopped believing in this dreamy, romantic tale and strained to see why the story was taking this particular direction. Also, the dialogue between Lucy and Daniel was so disappointing. Their souls have been waiting lifetimes to be together--and this is what they say????? 
 I've never read a book that both moved me to tears and made me scream in frustration."
3,"i was really disappointed with this compared to the first book. it was all about annalise, and do you know who likes annalise? no one. 
 honestly, i was pretty bored until the last 50 pages or so. it started off too slow, then, finally, around page 60 or so, it picked up and was really interesting and got me back for a while. and then annalise came back into the story and my interest level dropped. 
 it's not that i hate her; she's neither a good or bad character, personality wise. but she's so boring, so dry, so not developed enough other than her 'i sort of love nathan' plotline. and as for nathan's character--the complex, incredible character--seems to lose all sense of his character around her. he becomes dull and frankly not at all like himself. 
 i'll probably read the last book because i'm still in love with the plot and want to know how it ends but i'm praying it's going to live up to the standards of the first book, not this one."
5,"** spoiler alert ** 
 Just finished reading it yesterday. 
 I don't know why. It just made me cry. It was one one of the books that you just look back and see how much a character has grown, how much she has learnt. 
 Her giving up Dimitri and saying she wants him to be happy was very touching that I just cried. 
 Rose at book 1 was really looking for trouble. She was a risk-taker, and she pretty much broke the rules. In book 2, Rose was selfish, and she sort of used Mason. In the end, she decided that she didn't love him, and realized doing that was only going to hurt them more. She realized that love could not be forced. -Which pretty much said that she understood what love is, showing her growth from book 1. 
 Ironically, Rose was the one who scolded her classmates for breaking the rules, while on book 1, she broke the rules herself. 
 She was a very quick learner, and she understood that she couldn't take on the Strigoi easily, not like she has previously assumed. In the end, she killed two. 
 What I love about Vampire Academy books is that they are deep. It shows a person a lot: how you could find the strength in weakness, courage in fear, surviving in suffering, love from misunderstanding, and truth in lies."
3,"Edit people! Peter Carson became Paul in the span of one paragraph. The ending was pretty abrupt as well. Overall, not a bad story."
4,"The Man in the High Castle hinges on an alternate history premise that Axis powers won World War II and established occupation of the USA, dividing it up between them much like the Allies did to Germany. It speaks to each distinct nature of German, Japanese, and American power. 
 Germans are cold and tough-- you wouldn't want to live under German rule, as in the southern and eastern USA. 
 The Japanese are also cold, but borne more of formality rather than a particular cruelty. 
 However, even the Japanese have a subtler evil. The Germans have extended genocide to all of Africa and murder Jews in America, but they've also brought back slavery. In the Pacific States, the American shop owner sees black slaves around the city, at a corporate building specifically. PKD taps astutely into American race dynamics. Even under occupation as second-class cretins, Americans could feel superior at least to someone. 
 Thus may we contemplate the issue of collaboration. The shop owner is keenly aware of his place in relation to the Japanese masters, and yet he remained eager to please them. Up through the end of his storyline his utmost concern was making a good impression upon the Japanese occupiers and earning their respect. 
 Julia is another matter. How awful that she was duped for so long. Yet Julia was luckier than most in being perfectly able to protect herself, as she ultimately had to do. 
 The Man in the High Castle is a successful anti-fascist novel because in the end it shows how weak fascism is 1) to be threatened by Grasshopper, 2) (view spoiler)[to die at a woman's hand (hide spoiler)], 3) to find beauty in a Jew's art, and 4) to harbor resistors at the highest level of the Reich (a coup in the works). 
 Ultimately, The Man in the High Castle showed that fascist rule will foster alliances in unlikely places-- and though it can be popular as the facade of power can, the truth of its weakness can't be kept from the light forever. 
 Even in the face of outstanding odds, precipitous events shape the course of history and 
 resistance can prevail"
5,"I powered through this book over the course of a couple of days. I picked it up at the library several weeks ago because I was completely taken with the gorgeous cover. 
 Overall, my immediate impression after shutting the book is that I really liked it. The highly unreliable narrator made the entire story very fascinating. I spent most of the novel trying to figure out what was real and what was not. Even at the end, I found myself wondering if there was more made up than was explicitly stated (view spoiler)[(with regards to the other characters) (hide spoiler)]. 
 While I do not have any close experience with paranoid schizophrenia, it seemed to me that it was handled well. I loved nearly all of the characters and how they orbited around Alex throughout the novel. There was a whole lot going on with regards to subplots, and the scoreboard thing bordered on ridiculous, but it did not lessen my enjoyment of the book at all. 
 Definitely a 4.5/5 star read for me."
4,"The author does a good job of exploring many aspects of introversion versus extroversion 
 1. possible evolutionary origins 
 2. the nature and nurture that leads someone to be an introvert, extrovert, or pseudo-extrovert 
 3. group dynamics 
 4. how America's love affair with extroverts began 
 5. how this love affair impacts our government 
 6. international values of introversion and extroversion, and personality distributions in different countries 
 7. workplace accomodations for both types of personalities 
 8. school accomodations for both types of personalities 
 Sometimes the author would build up a simplified point, and then acknowledge the simplification, which irritated me quite a bit, but I otherwise thought it was an interesting and educational"
2,"I just didn't care for it. I tried this as an audiobook and found the narrator's voices for Safi and the others to be annoying, so that's probably a huge part of why this was a DNF for me."
1,WHAT HAPPENED? This first book was so fantastic and then this is what we get?! Was it just me or did the characters all seem like they were years and years older then the first book and that Saba clearly lost her mind and suddenly couldn't do anything without thinking the ever loving shit out of everything? In the first book she is so decisive and a clear leader and now she's going crazy sleeping with the enemy and risking getting pregnant just because she thinks Jack betrayed her??? What happened to her backbone? The Saba from Blood Red Road would have just killed Jack or kicked him in the nuts instead of going all damsel in distress and just stupid. I want a re-write.
4,I don't have any quote for this book because I can't stop reading !! I didn't take any note for this series.
2,"This book felt overwritten and the characters felt flimsy to me for some reason. But i may have been the wrong reader at the wrong time. I was actually enjoying it, then I had a baby and slogged my way through the last 150 pages, irritable, tired, and feeling completely stupid from sleep deprivation."
4,"Wow, this book was pure action. From page one to the finish and strangely I liked that. It didn't bother me that there was very little romance (and even that only at 85%) because Naasir and Andromeda made a great team and I somehow could feel their bonding through that. The search for the sleeping Ancient was a tough one but those two pulled it off like pros. I'm always greedy for more Raphael/Elena time, so to get their POVs was a nice bonus. We get to see the Archangel of death again and sadly, no, she AGAIN didn't bite the dust but, hey, her end is coming. That's for sure! And you can bet that I'll be watching her end with popcorn in my mouth and a nice smile on my face."

 Review Source: Publisher 
 Alterant was an incredible heart-jolting rollercoaster ride! I've heard of Serrilyn Kenyon before but unfortunately, I've never had the pleasure of reading any of her books and in the same manner, I'd never heard (nor read) anything by her co-writer Dianna Love. Needless to say, three pages into Alterant, I was sold. From the stunning world the authors created with Gods, Goddesses, and magical creatures, to the massive character line-up, this is a fantasy novel everyone will love. 
 Set in Atlanta, Alterant is the second book in the Blood Trinity series and begins just a few days after the conclusion of Book 1. After saving mankind from destruction, Evalle Kincaid is on her way to meet with the tribunal in an attempt to convince them that she is not a threat, an alterant that can be trusted around humans. Before arriving, she is approached by Storm, a Native American tracker and shapeshifter accomplice from her previous mission. Given their history and the emotional scars from her past, she has in her own way, learned to trust Storm and is surprised when he confronts her with a job of his own. After what seems like a never ending night of surprises, she finally reaches the tribunal and is tasked with a mission to recapture Beladors that were imprisoned and somehow escaped. Deeply conflicted, Evalle does not want to be the one who condemns other Beladors to a life that she fought so hard to escape. Feeling the pressure to succeed and the fate of all Beladors on her shoulders, this proves to be a race against time causing her to use the help of another alternant, Tristan, whom she previously imprisoned. Making it a temporary partnership that could work in (or against) her favor. 
 Although Alterant was a spectacular read, there was one thing that bothered me. At times I was unable to fully connect with Evalle. Because of her past, she is a very cold person who shows sympathy very rarely and only to those she trusts. And since that is mostly no one, the MC could come across as harsh, disconnected, and uncaring. It's not a huge complaint, but it did annoy me on several pages. I should also point out, for those readers who are expecting a romance novel based on the authors, you should toss that idea out the window and decide to read this novel for what it truly is, a wonderfully enchanting fantasy. 
 Overall, Alterant is a wonderful story that can stand on it is own. However, there are several instances in the book where I was thrown off because I did not read Blood Trinity. So I do recommend - if you have the time - picking up the first novel before diving into this one to avoid confusion. There is a glossary of terms in the back of the book which I always find helpful in fantasy novels such as this one. Sherrilyn Kenyon and Dianna Love did a phenomenal job creating a unique world that will draw readers in and have them begging for the next book in the series. If you are looking to take a break from your normal romance reads and switch gears to an action-packed adventure with an engrossing storyline and characters you will grow to love, then give Alterant a try."
2,"Wow. That was definitely a unique read... 
 The problem with satire and humor is you have to toe a thin line between ""trying too hard"" and ""not really funny."" This book landed on the ""not really funny"" side because the characters were made just realistic and just three dimensional enough that the story became kind of disturbing and creepy instead of absurd and silly. Some one liners truly made me laugh out loud (One of the boys wants to make a solo folk dubstep album, y'all. The dry delivery of that line was beautiful). For most of the book, I found myself cringing. 
 (view spoiler)[ I just need to ramble a bit for posterity sake... Because the storyline was really kind of ridiculous? Like... everything is bebopping along as a silly overthetop little story then suddenly the girls are trying to frame the band with murder and there's a deep and painful backstory about one of the boys being an absolute horrible asshole and then all of a sudden it's revealed that the main character MAY have been hallucinating the majority of the story... but then nope plot twist it was the girlfriend who's the murderer but also maybe the narrator is still unreliable, who knows? Then the moral of the story was that fangirls are all crazy and can't be trusted. 
 Also the fat shaming in this was really gross? Like, Apple's whole existence is to be the funny fat character, but then the narrator taps into how her interest in the band stems from really deep-seated insecurities about her weight. And then the things that one of the other characters said to her felt so grimy. It was just really awful, especially when the narrator went out of her way to say again and again that she wouldn't ""slutshame"" someone. (hide spoiler)]"
3,"3.5 not bad, not scary, and the mystery was solved quickly and easily. however this was a fun coming of age story with a lot of nostalgia. I enjoyed it."
4,"I can't say that, on the occasion that I decide to sit down in Barnes and Noble for an hour or two to read some Victorian horror fiction, I expect to come away with any genuine heebie-jeebies (except maybe in the case of Lovecraft, who wasn't all that Victorian and is mostly creepy for being reeeeally racist), but holy FUCK. 
 And I don't know if it's just because most of the horroring in Moreau is on animals, or because the Doctor's sociopathic chapter-long monologue in the middle of the book is straight up freakier than any of the more modern depictions of the character, but Jesus Christ. This is the real deal, man -- one novella that's anticipating everything from Josef Mengele to fucking PETA, not to mention the fact that it kicks off the entire body horror genre more than a half-decade early. 
 All this, and it also manages to undermine the entire notion of benevolent creationism before it even hits the halfway point. 
 Jesus, my skin is still crawling. That was fucking rough."
3,"I really enjoyed the start of this. The concept is very interesting and the training part was great. But when they actually started their soldier's life, it kind of lost me. The world was still interesting and the writing was good throughout, but the story wasn't for me. 
 First of all, it took a while for an actual plot to show up, it was just deaths and fights and a few moral conversations. None of it was bad, but it failed to get me invested. Turns out I'm kind of bored by fight scenes, even with aliens. I tend to drift off when listening to them. 
 And then Jane showed up... I disliked this storyline for various reasons. Let's just put aside that she's 6 and he's 76, I know that's complicated with her situation. It still didn't work for me. Maybe the idea just creeped me out, but the whole situation also didn't make sense to me. If you can make these special forces, why bother with the old people? They could make an army with just a few dna samples, it's not like you can only use person each once... Is it moral considerations? Because I don't believe they would hold in this world. 
 The Coral (excuse any wrong spelling, I listened to the audiobook and am to lazy to look it up) storyline was solid, but again just couldn't hold my interest. I just didn't care all that much about the colonies. Or John for that matter. 
 So all in all, a well written book with a great concept, but not my favourite story. I don't know if I'll continue on with the series, we'll see."
4,"On my phone so I will keep this short. The pacing for this one was bloody awful. It had a really slow start and lots of things ground the story to a halt. There was a lot of pros with this book though, Umbridge being a highlight. 
 4 stars because of the nostalgia, I'm not in any rush to reread this one again though."
3,"I think this would have been a really god book if there hadn't been a freaking love triangle. 
 Argh! 
 The plot was good, the identity of the killer was definitely a twist, but I'm stuck on the love triangle. I just really hate them. And the guys- there was Michael, who was nice and sweet and patient (he was totally willing to wait for her to make a decision!) and then there was Dean. (view spoiler)[Who's dad was a serial killer. (hide spoiler)] He was kinda broody. And muscular. That's about it. 
 Come to think about it, he really didn't say much. There was one Truth-or-Dare kiss, and a few steamy looks with Dean. Not much chemistry, I think. I could be wrong, but whatever. 
 I really liked Sloane. I think she was my favorite character. I wish we could have had more backstory on both Sloane and Lia, the other female characters. If I had roomed with Sloane, I feel like we would have been best friends in five seconds. And I wish we could have seen more of their Natural gifts in action. I liked that scene where (spoilers, but not that big a deal) Cassie was half-asleep and was figuring out Lia. If there had been more of that, that would have been cool. 
 (view spoiler)[ 
 And who the hell murdered Lorelei??? Does it ever actually really say? (hide spoiler)]"
5,"I've come to expect a lot from Julie Berry over the years, and though I was worried that this one wouldn't live up to her last book, All The Truth That's In Me, it most definitely did. This book may be too religious for a few people - honestly, I got uncomfortable at a few points because the interpretation of several aspects of the Christian religion were a bit different than my own - but when viewed as a part of the plot, it rounds out the book quite nicely. The characters are brilliant and unique, as always, and the plot is unexpected in the best of ways. I highly recommend this book for fans of the genre and/or author."

 Ava is a wonderful narrator and reading about the women in her life and how she came to be was such a joy. 
 This is certainly a book that sticks with you for all of the right reasons. I absolutely loved it.

 Decided to go ahead and re-read this one, too, before the new Sisterhood book comes out. I liked it better than I remembered and yet . . . I can't shake the feeling that it just wasn't enough somehow. Not enough about the girls' stories, about their individual friendships, just not enough. 
 Although now I'm almost wishing we were getting more about them instead of the original four. I think there's more left to tell with these three."
4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 This was recommended highly by my best friend and I can say that her praise was well deserved. I devoured this book in two days and honestly I probably could have read it faster than that. It was well written with metaphors that I absolutely loved. Juliette was a great protagonist. I understood why she felt the way she did and really feel in love with the way she thought. It took a little bit to get used to the cross-outs, but it always made me smile, because that is exactly how I think. I will think one thing and then try to shake it out of my brain, replacing it with a better thought. 
 At the beginning I loved the way Tahereh used the word shatter. It was such a loaded word and made me experience the feelings of Juliette that much clearer when it was used. All of the language that was used was fabulous, giving me clear representations of what Juliette was feeling. My only qualm was that I was editing the text as I read it even though I knew there was a purpose to the way that it was written. 
 The way that she introduced all of the new characters as the book went on starting with Adam was great. It fell into place perfectly. I loved the way that she introduced Kenji for a moment a few chapters before he became a part of the rising action. 
 And can we just talk about how wonderfully flawed Warner is? He is an absolute delight. I don't have any articulate words at the moment for him, but I just like him. He seems like a great character that we'll get to know better as the books go on. I can't wait to fully understand him and his motives. 
 There's so much great about this book. The only thing that I would like to see of in the next book is more female characters. I'm sure there will be, but there weren't any at all other than Juliette in Shatter Me. I don't believe there was any other female characters until the end with the twins. I kind of hope that is explained in the next book, but as long as there is a diverse cast of female characters in the next book I think I will be satisfied. 
 Overall this was a great book and I recommend it to anyone who just loves character depth and cool concepts with a bit of action."
5,"Lee's review posted on Guilty Pleasures 
 A dirty cop, a shady Youth Minister, and an a**hole ex husband were just a few things that Rocky had to deal with in Golden Trail, the third in Ms. Ashley's Burg series. If that wasn't enough to create a terrific book add in the love story between her and her ex, Tanner Layne (the man she left but never stopped loving) and you have the recipe for a master piece. 
 If the love story between Layne and Rocky wasn't enough to keep me in invested in Golden Trail, the twists and turns Kristen Ashley added into the story did it. Reading about these two people who had the perfect relationship that just ended without any warning was heart wrenching, but the other story lines Ms. Ashley put into play in this book made it a must read suspense. 
 Some authors have a knack for writing a good suspense, others are skilled in romance. One author pulling both of those aspects into one book successfully is extremely rare. Kristen Ashley did that in spades with Golden Trail. The lovable secondary characters, mainly Layne's two teenage sons, was just icing on the cake. 
 I fell in love with Layne and Rocky, and at the same time sat on the edge of my seat waiting to find out what twist or turn would occur next. All story lines in this book tied in perfectly together, and that makes for a book that is definitely worth reading."
3,"I would've liked this book so much more if it weren't for Shelby's dad. He was so hostile that it almost felt unreal. Even when Alex tried to explain that he understood why her dad felt the way he did, it still didn't do it for me. Otherwise this was a nice continuation of the series."
4,"A great start to a new series by Faith Erin Hicks, of whom I've long been an admirer. It's definitely a change of pace for her, (fantasy-ish, political machinations, etc.) but it's totally engaging and I look forward to more."
3,"A serviceable and enjoyable noirish semi-paranormal mystery thriller. The titular apartment doesn't play as prominent a role as you might expect--some more wholly representative title may have been more appropriate--but it does rev you up for the promise of the story, which is built around our contemporary sharing economy house-swapping craze. Timely! But under than fun gimmick, and alongside the pleasant descriptions of South Africa and Paris, is a pleasantly discomfiting little tale of terror, in which a listing marriage is endangered by secret shames of the past. A fun start to my traditional autumn spooky reading!"
4,"First read : May 2015 
 Okaaaaaaaaaaaaaay! So this was the first time I read a M/M romance and I genuinely enjoyed it. Honestly, I wasn't sure I would, being pansexual and all that, I'm usually more looking into M/F romances or F/F ones. The characters were pretty awesome, like always in this series but the story itself was pretty basic for M/M or F/F. The usual in-closet/out-closet romance... I found that somewhat disappointing at first... But since it was well written and that the romance and passion were electric, I didn't mind all that much in the end. I still have a hard time understanding the whole closet thing in our time though, it's so not like that where I'm from... But I guess there's a difference between some little town in Michigan or Connecticut and Paris, France. 
 (view spoiler)[I found the end a little disappointing too, I wish they could have had more time ""out"", with people and shit, but guess we will see them together in book 4. (hide spoiler)] 
 But overall, I had a great time, shed a pretty good amount of tears and had good laugh-out-loud moments too. That's all I ask for really. Can't wait to read Bella's story, I <3 her. 
 Second read : Mars 2017 
 Notes on previous review : 
 22 months reviews and loooooots of M/M romances later, I can say without a doubt that I don't go necessarily towards M/F or F/F since I'm pan. After all, love is love. 
 I also got out of my little liberal world and saw that homophobia is an everywhere problem contrary to what I used to think. My thoughts on the book, however, haven't really changed. I really love this story, and I guess I understand it better than I used to. I'm also still sad it ends ""too soon""."

3,"Heads up- My spoilers are frequently very detailed so only open them if you really want to know... 
 The main protagonist, Ellie, is an apathetic pothead and so very hard to like. She also has some rage issues, and did not come across as overly intelligent or thoughtful regarding her environment. She also describes herself and her living conditions as ""slovenly"" (her word not mine- I would say beyond disgusting or filthy). She also declares her hatred for doing laundry so instead wears dirty clothes from under her nasty bed or off a door knob, and goes to work smelling of all night sex and pot without benefit of at least a quick wipe down, and she even mentions not brushing her teeth in the first chapter. By half way I was hoping she might blow up in one of the many bombing scenes or get shot by the Pharmaceutical Company (Feno) or the Army (view spoiler)[(who are obviously the main antagonists). (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[I admit that I did smile when the bad guy Dr. Byrd (aka Bing) backhanded her and said he had been waiting a long time to do it and he also called her pathetic which she was. Since this is at 90% in, I waited a long time too so Amen brother! But he immediately took it too far when he pushed her face into a mirror over and over (hide spoiler)] The first 2/3 of the book are a lot of her thoughts and energies regarding sex with her boy toy, or pot and she is so slow to figure things out until the very end. 
 Her side-kick and best friend Bing is her conspiracy theorist (view spoiler)[chili stealing, bomb setting, back stabbing, manipulative inside man Dr. Byrd, (hide spoiler)] pot dealer yet he came across as having no inkling of the ""real"" conspiracy going on around him. (view spoiler)[Which should have been the first sign that he was a betrayer and inside man for the the big bad Pharmaceutical Company. (hide spoiler)] It just made him seem like a ""high as a kite"" wack-a-doo. I mean, what kind of conspiracy theorist does not read the ""local"" published newspaper a single time in the 7 years he is in quarantine? Not a very good one (view spoiler)[which should have been another sign he was working for the ""man"". (hide spoiler)]. His main purpose is to spoon feed a basic awareness of the surrounding environment and current quarantine situation to Ellie with every encounter they have because she is too dumb or high to pay attention to much around her (view spoiler)[and also to manipulate Ellie for Feno (and his own psychological tests) so they can blame her for being a domestic terrorist when it all literally blows apart. Let me reiterate that she is dumb beyond reason until the very end of the book and does not catch on very quickly that he has repeatedly betrayed her. It could be all that pot smoking or maybe all the psychological manipulation- hard to say. (hide spoiler)] Bing was actually the most developed and complex character in the entire book. 
 Her studly boy toy ""Guy"" is an Army soldier and horny dude who is exactly as you would expect an Army soldier turned private security guy to be, (view spoiler)[ie the poor misguided GI Joe ""hero"" who ""loves"" Ellie and will do anything to keep his woman alive and clear her name in the nefarious terrorist plot of Feno (hide spoiler)]. He was boring, fulfilling a cookie-cutter role of the typical overbearing male hero in love, and IMHO very gross given his frequent sex with our main character knowing her state of hygiene and squalor. (view spoiler)[It is no wonder that he contracts the same condition/illness everyone is in quarantine for, even though he was taking the preventative drugs. (hide spoiler)] 
 Frequent conversations regarding the smoking and obtaining of pot occur throughout the first 2/3 of the book and an entire chapter is included on how to make someone throw up. Ellie and Bing spend countless pages fighting with one another, which gets annoying and repetitive quickly. Then, to top it all off, the ending was predictable (except for 1 thing) and contrived.(view spoiler)[ The only detail I had not figured out before the book fed it to me was that Bing was Dr. Byrd. I was a little shocked at that which is why I give it 2 stars and not 1! (hide spoiler)] 
 I really wanted to like this, but got so bored and fed up with our apathetic, slovenly, perpetually high, dense main character, that it was a hard fought battle with myself to finish reading the book. Although, I must say parts of the ending were entertaining. 
 Overall, the premise showed great promise, but the implementation left something to be desired. For too much of the book, it was too hard to become interested or invested in the main character making it tedious to continue reading. Although very predictable, the ending did have a surprise or two and I did not completely hate Ellie in the end."
3,"Finally got around to reading this one. It was ... okay. I got annoyed with the main character. She had so much arrogance for her little amount of knowledge. I would have thought the nuns would have taught her better, not to mention the fact that they sent her out on this crazy mission at all, considering how she fumbled her first two missions. I could see the romance growing between her and the man she was supposed to be spying on. They really irritated each other at first, but it was sweet how much they cared for each other in the end. This book certainly had its ups and downs. Not sure whether I'll read the second one or not."
4,"I think it is a real pity that Michel Faber has said that The Book of Strange New Things will be his last novel. I think he is one of the most interesting and talented writers and each book of his that I have read has been remarkably different. Under the Skin still remains my favorite; it was just so weird and creepy. The Book of Strange New Things does have its sinister, paranoiac moments, for sure. The story is about a naive pastor who is funded by a powerful yet vague corporation to travel to a new found planet to minister to the ""aliens"". Meanwhile, back on earth, everything goes to hell in a hand basket for his wife and Peter, the minister, is torn between his commitment to God and his new congregation and his commitment to his wife and their marriage."
5,"5 stars 
 This woman doesn't even have ten books released and I'm gonna go ahead and claim that she can do no wrong. 
 Diana was an incredible lead. She was a very realistic character. Every situation she has been in is relatable. There are single parents out there that struggle and are happy and have hectic lives that still do everything they can to make their kids laugh. Diana was put through realistic situations from being late to baseball practice to trying to adapt without losing her morals. Even the issues she had with her mom are something I see myself deal with every day. That feeling of not being good enough to handle responsibility; it's all relatable. There's no life or death situation making the scene cheesy. Louis and Josh had me falling in love with those two snot faces. I have two baby cousins exactly like them: the sweet younger one and the one who thinks he's old enough to drive a car. 
 Dallas was also a relatable character. His struggle with his brother is something I've seen on a day-to-day basis. And that man was So god damn sexy. The romance between the two was also very slow burning. If you want to read a book where there is a sex scene every fifty pages then go somewhere else. This is not an erotic nor is it a chick lit. This is its own category of realistic romance.

3,"I couldn't really get over how stupid the characters acted. They could have been together A DECADE sooner, but instead they were too afraid to admit their true feelings to each other. What a waste of time. Sadly, this is probably pretty normal. Cautionary tale, I guess."
5,"Like the description says: ""A love story told in dictionary entries."" 
 English isn't my first language, so over half of these words were new to me. I took my time to look up every single one of them to understand better the story. Wow, wow, WOW... who knew learning words would make me feel so much? 
 Other than the unique format of the story, I loved that the story was not in chronological order. Ever since the first few pages you already know how bad things went, which helped me see the relationship in a more realistic way. 
 My reason for 5 stars is that I could easily identify with a lot of definitions. 
 Otherwise maybe my rating would have been lower, it's not a long story, it's not a detailed story, it's not something you'll have to analyze a lot. But it's a story that will make you feel something. More like, A LOT of somethings.

4,"Fate and fortune. Power and passion. What does it take to be the queen of a kingdom when you're only seventeen? 
 To be honest...I buy this book basically by its cover and title. Really, no exaggerate. As soon as I saw the beautiful cover, I was immediately dragged into and believe it'll be a great story. Just look at the queen the stars and the distant kingdom! Don't they look amazing? How can you resist it??? And the title...I can't reject any title with stars and moon and sun. They're lovely, don't you think? Even my own novel is about stars...everything stars stars stars to me. Now, what are you waiting for? Let's reveal the beautiful veil of this book! 
 Maya is cursed. With a horoscope that promises a marriage of death and destruction, she has earned only the scorn and fear of her father's kingdom. While Maya is content of her follow more scholarly pursuits, her whole world is torn apart when her father, the Raja, arranges a wedding of political convenience to quell outside rebellions. Soon Maya becomes the queen of Akaran ad wife of Amar. Neither roles are what she expected: As Akaran's queen, she finds her voice and power. As Amar's wife, she finds something else entirely: Compassion. Protection. Desire... 
 But Akaran has its own secret--thousands of locked doors, gardens of glass, and a tree that bears memories instead of fruit. Soon, Maya suspects her life is in danger. Yet, who, besides her husband, can she trust? With the fate of the human and Otherworldly realms hanging in the balance, Maya must unravel an ancient mystery that spans reincarnated lived to save those she loves the most...including herself. 
 Really...? This is the first time I've read the summery...it's boring!!! The summery is boring!!!! How come it narrates a wonderful story by such a flat tone? It's a great book with great plot with great characters!!!!! Ahhh!!! Oh wait! And it's an Indian story! ""A lush and vivid story that is steeped in Indian folklore and mythology."" A part of the summery, actually. And I can tell you...I've no idea it's a Indian story until I saw sari...it's excellent! I've expected nothing until I finish the book. It's kind of funning, actually, it might be my first time to do this. And absolutely crazy, for a person who is lack of time and money...it's a great risk to do so. So...will I recommend you to do this kind of act...? Of course...NOT!!! Unless you've nothing to spend expect books! Before I've started this book, I was kind of worry. Like...I had never read the summery, let alone knowing what it's about...the only thing I know is about a queen re-claiming her throne. That's all. Nothing more, nothing less. But then, I saw some of the reviews...oh...hold on, I didn't read the reviews, just the ranking. And some say they can't even bare to finish this book! How horrible must it be? But at the same time, lots of people praising this book as ""wonderful"" ""excellent"" ""dazzling"" or something like that. however...I guess books get both negative and positive reviews all the time...so...you can read the review...but whether the book is good or bad, that's all to yourselves. 
 So then I pick up this book and read it...no, devoured it. Within one mere day. (How I love the life without exams and free 24 hours to use by my own!!! No more stress!!! Yeah!!! Three cheers for college-to-be!!!) Is it good? Yes. Extraordinary? Well...that depends. Horrible? Nothing to do with that world. This is my first time to read something an Indian folktale based story. To me...Indian stories are mostly about religious story and lots of lots of god. But then, The Star-Touched Queen blinds all those suspicious, tales, legends together well. So while I was reading...I don't really travel to an Indian world, but something in between. It's a mix of both western YA novels...but also with the traditional form of India. That's great, I think. But...if you think re-claiming throne is about epic or something like The Queen of Tearling...you'll be disappointed. It's not an epic, nor does it have a lot of fighting scene. No brutal massacre, no bloody death lying on the floor. (Umm...well...there are a lot of death...but none of it can compare to those epic.) And nope, although ""re-claiming throne,"" nothing similar to The Queen of Tearling...on the contrary...it somehow reminds me East of the Sun, West of the Moon. You know...all the finding scenes and saving and blablabla. It's not a journey about fighting for her kingdom, but a journey of finding herself, finding who she truly is, and finding her power. Really, the fighting scene appears only about one minute...and then nothing...all gone into peace. 
 ""I'm a dead girl walking."" 
 Maya has thousands of identity, and there are lives before her recent life. After betraying, she must set everything right, but not without a cost. Unlike the protagonists nowadays...she isn't that strong. Not exactly. She is hunted, scared, and untrusting. But then, it's fun to read something different from badass characters. My only problem with her is that how can you trust someone without knowing her??? And since you don't trust Amar...how can you trust someone or something inside his house? (Don't worry, this isn't a spoiler...Maya never trust him. Not until the last. And it's no secret at all.) You know...some characters distrust the characters they live with...and when someone else appears...they just sweep their trust almost immediately? 
 Or I'm just too calculating? That doesn't sound like a good thing...distrust. But after surviving your school lives...you'll understand how horrible human being might be. (Don't worry, I believe there're still goodness inside human. But at least for those who are not worthy...that might be...) I love the journey with Maya. It's not extremely exciting or thrilling, but it all comes gradually. How she flee herself from disaster, how she try to figure out everything while everything seems to be hidden from her. And how she learns to let go of the past and turns back every mistake has made. 
 The first part of book is actually not as good as the second part...it's something that we've read before. Something we might inspect from other books. See? The fleeing princess, the rescuer, the sacrifices...and of course, the misleading. But then, the truly interesting part is in the second part, where Maya starts another journey, and she meets interesting company. A horse. A talking horse. I'm not going to talk about her...but really, she is one of the highlight in this book. Then her journey, yes , HER JOURNEY!!! While it is supposed to find her love one...but it's not. Well...correct the mistake...it's about him, but not all of the journey is. Maya also faces other things she needs to learn and help. So when it comes to the part she finds her jaani...everything goes extremely fast. That's one of the good things about the second part, it's really fast pace. Really fast. And how the villain crumples? ...within seconds. 
 So, we might feel like reading the same plot from other books while reading The Star-Touched Queen. However, the foreign worlds and well create realms makes it different. So when you're whining about the ""not-so-creative"" plots, the set of the story make a mend of that. And the description is especially beautiful. I'll recommend this book if you're fond of foreign culture and set. Although it's not entirely India...you can still catch a glimpse of those cultures we've learned before. And highly recommend for those stars lovers. Definitely need this.

 Like any other book in this series we'll get to know main character's history, what makes them.. them now. For D.. if you remember Noelle's speculation she's right but it'll all be told here. Beware of physical and mental abuse scene here, it's sick and disgusting to think human could do that."
4,"I have had Breaking Glass on my wishlist for a while, when the chance came to review it as part of the blog tour for Spencer Hill Press I jumped at the chance. While I am going to try and do this book justice, I am also going to be vague about what transpires in the pages as I don't want to ruin the book for future readers. 
 Ryan Morgan is cheating on his girlfriend Susannah. She finds out when she returns home earlier as a surprise and ends up drives off with Ryan following, and then Jeremy following close behind. Jeremy finds them and sees them arguing, then ends up in a crash, waking up with vague memory of what happened but no firm facts. To make it worse there is no sign of Susannah. 
 Breaking Glass is sectioned with numerical chapters, but within these chapters there are also Then and Now narratives, giving us the history between this trio, but also what is happening now, after the crash. The chapters follow Jeremy as he is dealing with a lot of issues, the loss of his mother, his leg injury that quickly results in the loss of his leg, trying to find the truth about what happened to Susannah, the nefarious Mr Patrick Walker, and the mysterious goings on. 
 Jeremy is the protagonist, and initially I didn't know how to take him, I thought he was sad, lonely, and self deprecating, but as the story progresses and we get to see more of Jeremy's personality coming out, both the good and the bad parts of him, I did begin to feel sad for him and what he is trying to deal unsuccessfully with. Ryan has to learn to grow, to deal with the hand he has been given and find some way to find comfort in all of his losses. He also has a lot of people on hand to help him out, one of these is Marisa, who is helping him study for classes and eventually is brought in a Jeremy's sidekick in his sleuthing. 
 Breaking Glass was a lot more mystery than I expected, but this only added to the story. I continuously found myself trying to put the hints together and come up with the end result before I was told what was really happening. Lisa has written a book that certainly grabs hold right to the very last page and weaves a tale of mystery, suspense and supernatural goings on seamlessly into the plot, and while it wasn't what I expected I still found it a captivating and enjoyable read."

 This book is a little gem. I'm surprised more people didn't like it - or love it dearly! (I definitely don't understand any of the one star reviews, and guess that others just didn't ""get"" it like I did.) 
 This novel charmed me from the very beginning, and I smiled, or chuckled throughout it. The author's imagination is a glory to behold, the novel was (for me) utterly fascinating, and the whole premise was witty without being twee, or too cutesy. I seriously want to keep in touch with all the characters in this novel, as they swiftly became endearing friends. 
 With nods to McCaffee, Tolkien, Star Wars, and many other tropes, this little world beguiled me from the start. The audiobook version is SO GOOD, I am nearly plotzing....! They hired some small-time actor named Ari Fliakos, who not only handled all the character's voices with ease, no matter how many were introduced, but also made listening to this 7 hour + 41 min. unabridged novel seem like a breeze! He was elderly when speaking for Mr Penumbra, he was smarmy when needed - hell, this kid acted his pants off! Somebody give him a leading role, quick!! He's definitely worth it, I promise. (He can usually be found on Broadway, in someone famous' play.). My husband listened to a short bit of it each night I was lying in bed listening, as he was getting ready for bed. It actually held his attention, and he doesn't like reading. My daughter and youngest son had to tear themselves away from listening to it while in my room as well, as they had more pressing things to do...but later on, they wanted to know what was going on in this novel, who was reading it, and if it was any good....? Success!! Lol, here is a pic of the actor who made listening to the audiobook such a joy: 
 (Pic to follow) 
 Cute, no.....? ;) 
 http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1406557/. 
 Anyway, I am seriously considering getting a membership to Audible.com, just so I can keep re-listening to this novel.....I don't think I've ever felt this way about ANY audiobook since. , and I probably never will. But if you will permit me, this novel is NOT amazing just because some cute kid can act said pants off - oh no! This novel will be bought for family and friends, in both paperback and kindle form, for Christmas. It's been a long time since I've loved a book this much, and wanted to share it with everyone I know. I just hope everyone that reads this review will feel the same way, after giving SOME form of this novel a try. 
 Four stars for a very entertaining novel about books. If you want a more detailed idea about what this novel is about, may I suggest these fantastic reviewers, here at goodreads?

4,"I love that all the story lines wrapped up sensibly and without true malice. Though the tension was certainly present at the start. The main relationship was beautifully portrayed and had such surprising depth that I find it hard to conceive that the timeframe was a little over a week, and I do wish that that had been conveyed as quite a bit longer. 
 Overall a soothing, sensible and balanced work, with endearing characters, who confront issues before they grow out of proportion and who had actual, interesting and witty, conversations with each other. Lovely incorporation of historical fact as usual."
5,"Rating 4.5 stars 
 Well-written sports-themed book are my jam, and this one hits all the right notes. This is part of a series about three sisters who only have their now-dead manipulative father in common. The heroine has always wanted to please her father and be in-charge of his franchise but thanks to her father, she now has to fight to rebuild her team with the help of two half sisters who she doesn't get along with. 
 The hero figures into the heroine's game-plan, too bad he doesn't like being moved to a new team when he is at the end of his career and close to getting his shot at glory. Now, I liked the hero's close-knit family and his family values too. He is easy-going and well sorted, not like the heroine who had a messed up childhood and has to be tougher than anyone because the world she lives in is sexist. So imagine how annoyed she is with the pesky attraction she shares with the hero! 
 I loved the inter-play between the hero and heroine and how they can't fight their attraction despite so many factors standing in the way. The book also really sets-up future books and I for one am glad to have found such a well-written contemporary romance.

4,"If you went into Ball & Chain thinking you were getting a romance novel, you were sadly mistaken. 
 I believe this is the most action packed novel in the Cut & Run series. 
 Let me just start this out by saying, my love for Ty and Zane has grown tremendously. 
 I think the fact that they weren't the main focus of this book, made me hungry for more of them. 
 It's also very apparent in Ball & Chain that Ty and Zane have grown and developed a ton throughout the course of the series. 
 From start to finish, there is a copious amount of foreshadowing. 
 If you think something is going to happen - it most likely is going to. 
 You think it's predicable, but Abigail Roux cleverly threw in curve-balls when you were least expecting them. With that being said I must warn you now, the plot does have a tendency to jump around. And at times be a little hard to follow. You may be clutching your eReader going what the fuck? 
 I thought Ball & Chain had a decent amount of mystery and suspense factor. The romance was dull and lacking, but I also think the plot wouldn't have made as much sense if they were off banging like bunnies while shit was hitting the fan. 
 One of the biggest problems I had with this book is I did not like the fact that Nick and Kelly are the prominent characters in this. I do not think I will be reading their series. I also wasn't a fan of the frequent substance abuse. Why was it necessary to add in those inconsequential details? By the way these guys have been painted time and time again, they do not seem like the type to risk their jobs, just to blaze up. 
 Despite the negative reviews and a few of my own issues, I mostly enjoyed Ball & Chain. 
 I was very happy with how things with Ty and Zane all tied together at the end of the book. 
 Another thing I enjoyed about Ball & Chain - some of the quotes. 
 (view spoiler)[ 18% - ""Where's Dad?"" ""Still trying to convince your grandfather that we did not just hit the shore of Guadalcanal and he should not hit anyone on the head with that shovel."" 
 31% ""Oh, come on!"" Ty called after him as he ducked into the bathroom. ""Lying naked on a rug in front of a fireplace, in a fucking castle?"" 
 37% ""I'm a sniper with a tremor Garrett, it's like a bad joke."" (hide spoiler)]"
2,"I really tried to like this book, I really did but, the beginning ruined it for me and I ended up DNFing this. It'll have to be something I come back to"
5,I guessed it! I am so proud of myself.
0,"It's hard to write a review of something you didn't finish. I know this is a best-selling YA series, and I know James Patterson can basically paper his house with $100 bills from his writing, but I've never read any of it. I decided to attempt it, and made it 50 pages in before giving up. (To paraphrase Nancy Pearl, you don't owe the book that much, give it 50 pages.) 
 The good: 
 It's an interesting concept: winged tweens and kids escape from a secret lab. 
 Patterson knows how to move the action along without you realizing it. All of a sudden you've gone from ""breakfast"" to ""halfway to California"" before you know it. 
 Because it's plot-driven, it reads quickly and easily, which could be appealing to reluctant readers or people burned by assigned ""classics"" too many times. 
 The bad: 
 The dialog. Oof. 
 The writing is clunky for my tastes. I am not a literary snob by any means, but this just didn't do it for me. That doesn't mean it's not good, it just didn't click with me for whatever reason. 
 Who I'd recommend it for: reluctant readers, someone who wants to be absorbed in the story-- I hate flying, but I try to find something absorbing to distract me, and I'd suggest this to someone in the same position."
3,"I love cults. They're funny. 
 12/20 - This was really disappointing. The best parts were from Ann Eliza Young's POV. The modern day stuff, while adorably told from Jordan's POV, were throw-away, and I could've done without. 
 Really just...extremely boring."
5,"Wow!! Just wow... 
 This book left me speechless and in between the beginning and the end....I laughed, busted a gut, fell in love with Jillian/Jessica and Jackson/Jude. 
 A breath of fresh air that entwines angst, humor, dark, light, new beginnings, death and touchy subjects. 
 Sorry, but I am too excited to get to the next book and see what happens next!!"
5,"I must say, despite the obvious amazingness of this book, I felt disappointed when I realized that THG takes after Battle Royale so much. 
 Fortunately, though, I haven't read Battle Royale, so my reading experience was not at all soured by the un-originality of it all."
5,"Edit: I just finished the book a second time, and I'm still completly in love with the world, characters and plot line. I'm excited to be reading 'A Court of Mist and Fury' very soon! 
 THIS BOOK!!! This book was probably one of my favorites I've read this year - no wait that I've read ever. 
 I absolutely loved it. The plot was fantastic; I just couldn't stop reading. Very intriguing. 
 Also the characters were very well written. I liked the main characters, but also the side characters. Lucien... I don't know why but I loved him so much omg. 
 AMAZING BOOK. And I think everyone should read it. It's worth it! 
 I need more of 'A Court Of Thorns And Roses'! I need it now! Right now!"
3,"A little disappointed, but still not bad. 
 I was exacting more from the book, because seems like it's peoples favorite of the series. 
 O well, it's a final book, and I often don't like how series ends. 
 All in all, a very decent series, better than most in this genre (of which I read of course)."
4,"Devil in Winter is one of my favourite historical romances. It had everything I ever want in my romance: opposites attract; charming rogue with a heart of gold; character growth and great chemistry; slow burning lust turning organically into love. Lisa Kleypas is unbeatable at creating sweet, swoon-worthy and natural romances. Even under the most unbelievable circumstances, her romances still ring true. 
 Still I was apprehensive to read this one because it featured my favourite couple from Devil in Winter, Sebastian and Evie. I shouldn't have worried, Kleypas does them justice! They are still so sweet, in love and Sebastian is still the charming, witty and irreverent rogue. 
 The glimpse into their future and family was so satisfying and keeps me wanting for more - I hope we revisit them soon. 
 The sentral couple was also worthy of the sequel even if they still come second to the originals. Gabriel was amazing - charismatic, smart, compassionate and beautiful. Pandora was his match and their banter was top-notch. 
 Still, I felt that they didn't burn as bright and the love between them didn't feel quite so ""there"". Pandora was a little too distant and removed. Her feelings were logical and clear but the passion and emotion was a bit dulled for me. Gabriel, on the other hand, was too accepting of anything thrown his way and I didn't quite understand why he would fall for someone so different from what he is used to. 
 However, this was still a brilliant romance up to the last 30% where some OTT drama came about which was unnecessary. As I mentioned, I prefer organic and character driven romances as opposed to drama and unnecessary gimmicks. Especially when those include (view spoiler)[assassination plots... (hide spoiler)] 
 What the actual hell went there and why was it necessary except for setting up the next book? I think Kleypas just didn't think of a way to prolong the romance so she fell for this plot device - too bad because the book could have been perfect without it. 
 Anyway, still, this book is a high bar set by Kleypas and another jewel in her crown."
5,"Wow... I knew everyone liked this book, but I didn't know why. Yeah, I was sceptical, as always. But now I truly understand the reason behind all this hype. 
 Honestly, I started to understand myself better after reading this book. And my family. Now I can see how blind I actually was. I'm glad I've read this book now. And I will definitely reread it after some time. 
 There are some things we have to constantly remind ourselves, unfortunately. Human's memory is very inconvenient thing."
3,"Thats was an ok read, but not enough to really satisfy me. It was nice and fluffy, over the top insta-love and quite enjoyable - but lacking. It could have been good if the characters had had a little more depths and the issues they had not simply vanished but talked through and worked through. Pity. 
 Not recommend if you hate: insta-love, over the top jealousy, caveman alpha male, present tense"
4,review to come
3,"As you can see, I ended up reading book three of three in a series. This is because I got this book as a gift when a friend asked me to be godmother to her daughter. A fun gesture I think :) 
 Now, this book is very much a remix of the Sleeping Beauty fairytale. You have the classic tale, but also hints at Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel and a number of other well known fairytale tropes. We follow a young prince, a huntsman, and a girl in a red hood as they explore a long forgotten kingdom, hidden behind a magical wall of thorns. Inside they find everyone asleep, their beautiful queen slowly bleeding to death through a small wound in her finger. But why was this queen put to sleep in the first place? Who or what has been howling on this side of the thorn wall, while everything seemed to be asleep? And why are there so many ransacked houses? 
 A fun and easy read! The mystery kept me intrigued and the characters were interesting. The answer to the mystery didn't blow me away, but neither did it disappoint. Recommended if you like new takes on old fairytales."
4,"Sweet and angsty. 
 I expected much more angst than there really was in this book. Not as much angst as expected from a GFY character when faced with the realization that you don't really know your own sexuality. 
 I liked how the relationship builds between the characters. 
 This double-GFY romance will appeal to readers who enjoy GFY fantasies."
3,"I've not much to say about this. Cute (if you can call psychological torture and manipulation cute). Well written - the atmosphere created by the tone was harshly juxtaposed by the terrible things it was actually conveying. More so the better for it as it let me enter the main characters' (Rho's) headspace: the confusion, the uncertainty and the helplessness were all magnified. 
 I could have read double this, easy."

5,"This Song Will Save Your Life first came to my attention in early 2013. I was offered an e-galley from the publisher, but then sadly couldn't fulfill my obligation to get it read and reviewed prior to its release, as life sort of got away from me. Fast forward two years later, and I once again started thinking about reading this one - but this time via audiobook. And I'm actually really glad I went that route. Listening to an audiobook allows me to savor the book for a longer period of time - it took me approximately two weeks to get through the audio version, compared to the (maybe) two days it would have taken me to read the book - and I think that, for this book in particular, that was a good thing. Elise is someone I immediately felt drawn to mostly because she had such a hard time of it. The first two chapters don't pull any punches - we're hit with a self-harm scenario straight off the bat - and her desire to just have a friend really resonated with me as someone who works in the education field. By listening to the book, I was able to really think more in depth about Elise and what makes her tick, as well as more fully immersing myself in her world. And I'm really glad I did.

2,"I gave it 2 stars because it wasn't for me. I never watched 30 rock nor SNL. Yeah, I've seen some clips and gifs, but that's it. So, I'm not that familiar with Tina and her work."
5,"This series continues to be one of my favorites and this installment doesn't disappoint. I'lladmit, I didn't know where the story could go after book five Spider's Revengewhere Jennifer Estep ended a major story arc. Now the books (at least the two released since Spider's Revenge) seem to be focusing on what happens next since Mab. Where does Gin's life go now that the thing she's been working toward for so long is done? How will she finally get to the point where she can leave her assassin life behind? 
 In By a Thread we got Gin trying to take a vaction and work through things with Bria and unfinshed business with Donovan Caine. 
 In Widow's Web, Owen and Gin's relationship is at the foreground. Former Ashland resident Salina Dubois has come back to town. Her motivations are unknown but one thing she make perfectly clear is she is more than ready to pick back up with her ex-love Owen. We get a big helping of Owen's past in this book and that is fine by me. I've always liked Owen. Usually I dislike it when authors will change the love interest a few books into a series, but with Owen I welcomed it. While I didn't particularly find anything too shocking or out-of-nowhere, I liked seeing the characters reactions to the past. 
 A surprising character was Phillip Kincaid. If you read the short e-story Thread of Death we get a hint at the past that is fully revealed here in Widow's Web. Phillip Kincaid is part of Ashland underworld. So how / why is he connected to Owen? We find out all in this book. Even though he's supposed to be a ""bad guy"", one of those who may be gunning for Gin now that she's known as the Spider, we get to see that there are things that he cares about. Just another way that Jennifer Estep is showing us that nothing is ever just black and white in this world. There are definitely shades of gray. I look forward to seeing how Kincaid will be incorporated into the series. 
 Gin and Owen's relationship is really put to the test. Jennifer Estep really writes this book with a lot of care. Many may not like the direction the book was taken and I can see that side, but overall I do feel like, given the circumstances of the book, what happened had to happen. If Jennifer Estep would have glossed over it I think the book / series would have lost that emotional connection that I really love about it. I think the end result of the series will be better. 
 I wish I could have read the book slower, but in true Elemental Assassin form I just couldn't put it down. The next book in the series Deadly Sting will not be out until next spring. Until Then!"
4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 SO EPIC!!! This short story has whet my appetite for the next book and now august seems so far away. 
 It was really interesting to read from a Mog's perspective. (i haven't read the other lost files books). 
 I can't believe that the Lorien can transfer their powers to other people at all!!! I hope Adam, Sam and Malcolm meet up with the rest of the guard (but aren't they all in the same place, because of the battle that occurred in rise of nine???)"
3,"Sigh- if I do continue with the series (because it's cute enough and entertaining) I will have to read. The narrator does a great job with Cat- the main character- but Bones is too corny to listen to. And her mother sounds like the mom on That 70's Show! 
 I like that the plot widened and twisted to bring in more characters and more action. I did like it better than the last one, but still only max of 3 stars for me."
3,"A lot of the same things I felt for the Alchemist. But presented better. At least I didn't hate the main character, and could see why he was making his decisions. Very short, interesting."
5,"I can't find the words to do this incredible story justice. If the blurb has piqued your interest, rest assured, this story delivers every bit of heart, hurt, and hope you'd expect it to. And the ending is so achingly beautiful! Highly recommended."
4,Owen Armstrong is much more better than Augustus Waters. Just sayin'.
4,"Stroke of Midnight was another great book in the breed series. Lots of danger, action and of course passion so hot you might get burned."
5,"MORE!! MORE!!!!! MOREEEEEE!!! 
 I don't know what exactly were my expectations when I started to read this.. but this clearly wasn't it. 
 I'M BLOWN AWAY 
 JUST TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY.... 
 BY YOU HUNTER!!! 
 HUNTERRRRR OH HUNTER... You're just my kind of guy!! 
 The story was really good. If I have to be totally honest, I'd say that I kinda figured out the twist in the middle. It was a little obvious to me, but I still had my doubts and as it turns out, I was right all along. It was beautiful. Cami may just be one of the most naive, insensitive or trusting fictional character that I have ever come across. She has her moments. I like that she doesn't really care what other people say. I love how she can be outspoken one minute and then be all shy and blushing the next. Hunter on the other hand, is just SUPER ATTENTIVE. He's every girl's dream come true. I always say that I love books with a guy's POV. Now, in Hunter's case... his POV's were extra special since it still held mysteries. 
 Cami and Hunter were just perfect for each other. I love their talks. I love how they treat each other. They were totally funny at some point, especially HUNTER. Ohmygosh, I will never forget your childish display of strength! HAHA. I'm so glad that the twist didn't end up hurting these two in the end. 
 All in all, I'm a very happy reader and I get to sleep now knowing that I got a nice, happy ending. 
 P.S. I said more at the start of this review because I WANT IT TO BE LONGER. I would love to have at least another chapter just to see what'll happen to them after the storm. But anyhoo.. the end of this one's still purely satisfying. 
 Thanks, Ms. Weatherford! ^_^"
3,"Ok, so I started watching the Vampire Diaries TV series for a few friends and my sister, and I really liked it! So I got really excited when I found out that they were a book series before they were a TV show, and of course I hunted them down. I was pretty disappointed because this book was by far different from show and not in a good way. I found Elena irritating, self centered, selfish, and annoying. I couldn't get into the book."
4,"4 Engaging Stars!

 Okay! Let's start with first, that I love J.L. Berg. And second if you aren't a fan of cliffhangers than I would suggest waiting for book 2, Remembering Everly which comes out April 5/16, because we are left with a doozy of a cliffhanger. 
 I went into this book not knowing too much and I was immediately hooked. Throughout the book we started to unpeel all the layers giving us more and more of the back story between August and Everly. At the beginning, I didn't know to love her hate August when I was reading from Everly's POV, but when I was reading from August you couldn't help but love him. 
 ~They didn't run after me. They know my routine. I always ran, always fled. ~ 
 As for Everly, she had many strong points and also some not so flattering points. Normally I don't love heroines who run away at the start of trouble, nor heroines who waiver back in forth between me. And Everly had both of these qualities in spades, however since we were missing so much of the back story which was a slow build throughout I was able to overlook the qualities for the most part. 
 Now, lets talk about Ryan. He was written in a way that you couldn't help but like him. From the choices he made, to his actions. But for me I still wanted August more for Everly, there emotional bond was too strong to ignore for them and the reader. 
 As we start to get more and more of the story behind August's amnesia and the past secrets you get more hooked, but once we finally think things are going to go smoothly the past comes back to haunt both of these two. 
 ""Took you long enough."" 
 Gotta admit I'm so not okay with Everly's decision when faced with her past. Actually now that I think about it more, it's how she faces all her decisions. This is when her running gets tiresome. Back and forth, and back and forth but never can she just be content with herself. If she was able to do that, then she would make way better decisions and choices. She let the past happen by hiding and never really finding out why or what was going on. Now to only repeat the same mistake. 
 Then just as I was getting okay with her decision, even though I wasn't happy about it. The secrets all come out leaving us with a whopper of a cliffhanger. Now April feels ions away :( until we get to find out how everyone fairs after the truth and past finally being revealed. 
 Did I like this book? Yes, very much as it had me engaged from beginning to end. Will I read more from the series? Yes, of course. After that ending you can't NOT read the next book. Am I team Ryan or team August? Team August all the way. As I know there is more behind his behavior and the past but we have to wait to find out what it is in Remembering Everly."
5,"Rosie Bloom loves to escape in a good romance novel. She'd love even more to write them. But she's unable to even utter the word ""sex"" (she prefers ""friskiness""), and she's recently found out from her roommates that ""briar patch,"" ""pleasure garden,"" and ""lady folds"" are not good euphemisms. Consequently, Rosie's finding that her virgin status might be impeding her future career. With help from her two best friends, Henry and Delaney, Rosie sets off on a whirlwind dating tour, trying whatever she can to gain some experience. She goes on date after date with co-workers, dating site matches, friends of friends, and even random strangers -- each one ending worse than the last. Her hilarious, cringe-worthy dates are bad enough that any sane person would give up... but not Rosie. 
 The Virgin Romance Novelist has to be the most hilarious book I've read this year. From the first page, the easy writing style and witty dialogue won me over. I laughed so hard that I woke my boyfriend up. I may have even woken the neighbors up. I wouldn't be surprised -- that's how funny this book is. But it's not just funny. It's also heartwarming. And a little angsty. Very embarrassing. And romantic. Not to mention sexy. It's a little bit of everything, really. But mostly funny. 
 Throughout the book, I knew exactly how it was going to end, but getting there was a great ride. I was rooting for her love interest all along, and I'm so happy that she ended up with him. I know this is a standalone, but I would not hesitate to read another book about Rosie. 
 Even though it's only March, I have no doubt that The Virgin Romance Novelist will be one of my favorites this year. 
 Thanks to Netgalley and the author for the free copy!

2,IT'S THAT ANNOYING MOMENT WHEN I DON'T WANT TO READ IT BUT THE PRETTY COVER ATTRACTS ME. LOOK AT IT. IT'S SO PWETTY.
2,Date a guess.
4,"I really liked this odd book. It was anything, but ordinary, although the conclusion sure was a swift HEA. I really like the character development and story that Megan Hart manages to create."
4,"I LOVED this book, but I was unsure of how to rate it, so I settled for a common ground. 
 I got to admit I regularly don't read books like these, mostly because I feel I've read my fair share of them. And when I mean this kind, I mean the fluffy, high school books. But I felt I understood Natalie from the start because I sometimes questioned myself the same things she did & felt similarly like her. I obviously never went to the same extent as she for I barely survived the questioning part. 
 Regardless of all that, I must admit I loved the story. It was incredibly clicheish & silly at times, but it was fun to read about. Jody Gehrman took a cliche, gave it some latin spice and a tiny bit of swearing in spanish & Babe in Boyland was born. I found myself laughing at times all alone in my room. It was sweet, innocent and great to read about. 
 Still some cliches made me want to scream at loud, hence my rate. So, anyway DON'T listen to me and think it will suck a bit, but DO listen to me and read it. I swear it WILL surprise you!"
3,"3.5 stars. To be completely honest, I'm not sure I would have kept reading this if I wasn't listening to it on audiobook on loan from my library. It didn't suit my mood, which like many Americans (and let's be real, world citizens) at the moment, is dark, dark depression. 
 I powered through Sleeping Giants at 1.6x speed and unlike most times I think of giving up on a book and then don't, I didn't regret it. 
 Sleeping Giants begins with a flashback as a girl named Rose falls through the earth and lands on a giant metal hand. Authorities are quickly called in and flashing forward to present day, Rose is now a respected scientist leading the study of the metal hand. The book is told mostly through interviews, recordings, and journal entries. A mysterious man, a kind of Machiavellian figure at the center of the book, with seemingly unending resources and behind-the-scenes power gathers a group of people together to work on Rose's team. There's Kara, the hot-headed, tell-it-as-it-is pilot and her sweet, slightly dumb jock of a co-pilot, Ryan. Later comes Victor Couture, a French Canadian linguist with an ego the size of Quebec and Alyssa Papantoniou, a genius geneticist who rubs everyone the wrong way. 
 Because the story unveils through a series of documents, you really get to know everyone and it's a fun way to get inside the heads of all the characters. Together they question everything about the hand. Where did it come from? Who originally built it? Are there more pieces out there? If so, what is its purpose? 
 As they learn the answers to these questions, the story spirals out of control. I wasn't sure Neuvel would manage to pull it all together by the end, but much to my delight, he succeeded. The fast-paced ending really made up for the somewhat slow beginning. 
 What makes this such a fun audioread is that the cast of characters is HUGE and they almost have a full production going on with all the great voice actors they hired. Even the slower parts of the story were made more interesting by the constant switching of narrators. This would be a good pick for a long road trip or something to listen to while exercising."
5,"This book had me hanging on its every word, crying, and just generally dying of emotions. Whoa. 
 I'd actually been complaining to a friend that I was having a reading block of sorts. I had read so many books one right after another that I had become a bit desensitized and nothing was really amazing me. But this book has proven that that block was just a puff of smoke. I just finished it and I'm still trying to get my brain to catch back up. 
 The first word that comes to mind in regard to this book is suspenseful. I was holding my breath at every action and emotional scene, imagining everything going on as clearly as if I were seeing it with my own eyes. Over the course of the series, the characters have all become familiar and well-developed to me and I love them. I mentioned in my review for Unspoken that Kami was not extraordinary but solid and that I loved her cultural background. Well now I can safely say I also love Kami as a character, along with Jared, Ash, Jon, Tomo, Rusty, Angela, Holly, heck, even Lillian. (Just not Rob, for obvious reasons.) I became very attached to the town of Sorry-in-the-Vale and our principal characters. (view spoiler)[I am still so upset about Rusty. Usually I don't get that worked up over character deaths but I had gotten fond of him and the whole thing about his sacrifice was so heart-stabbingly emotional. (hide spoiler)] Kami is a great protagonist. She never annoyed me, she was in control but knew when she needed help, and I just enjoyed having her as the MC. 
 Jared and Kami took me on an emotional rollercoaster this whole book. One moment they were being couple-y, the next Jared was smashing both Kami's heart and mine into tiny little pieces. At one point I started getting so frustrated with him I wanted to just push Kami at Ash and say ""just go with him, he won't torture us like this"" but that was only fleeting. I loved how (view spoiler)[at the end when Jared explained himself and why he kept rejecting Kami it made sense. I'm still dying over their clearing up of things in the epilogue, I just wanted them to be together so badly. (hide spoiler)] 
 Everything about this book and series was entrancing, spectacular, and adrenaline-filled. I definitely had not expected to love it this much when I started Unspoken, but it has surprised me and more. Now I'm just going to go weep a bit that it's over and that I finished it so quickly as I devoured the story at top speed to find out what would happen next. 
 Highly recommended!"
4,"Holy wow! All the feelings. I loved Louisa so much and her real relationship with her sister and family. Quite the tear-jerker, this one."
3,"Alma Belasco, now an octogenarian living in a retirement residence, is telling the story of her life to her grandson Seth and her immigrant care worker Irina. Alma met Ichimei Fukuda, the son of her family's Japanese gardener, when they were children. Their instant connection eventually turned into a lifelong love affair which is recounted through letters and flashbacks. The Fukuda family was sent to an internment camp for Japanese-Americans during World War II, and lived under terrible conditions in the Utah desert. Ichimei and Alma started corresponding at that time. Alma was a Jew from Poland who had been sent to relatives in the United States as the Nazis invaded her country, so she had also been a victim of prejudice. 
 The book has a large number of characters and covers many social problems, tragedies, and important events in the 20th Century. There were humorous passages about growing old, and the romance was a sweet story. But it seemed that we got to know a lot of characters in a superficial way. I would have cared more about their outcomes if the book had gone deeper into the emotions of the main characters, and found it took a while to warm up to them. 3.5 stars."
3,"This was a easy read, not much substance. But still a nice steamy read."
4,"Oh shit that was some dark twisted fuckery right there!! The story of Mia and Brandon were crazy!! There is no good way to sum up this story except that I totally liked it hahaha. There wasn't much development in the characters or the story really it just jumped straight into the action, like you've already known what's going on. Not saying that that's bad!! Well if you read this book prepare yourself for some seriously dark and disturbing shit. I didn't have the feeling of love for the H like I have in other books either, maybe that's due to the under development meh anyway enjoy it really is good!! Crazy, but good!"
2,"Honestly, this book bored me in places. I got through it and liked it okay, but there was too much thinking and planning and not enough action. It's not that I need dramatic scenes everywhere, but it took too much time to move the characters from one place to another, so the plot seemed to plod along at times. Also, Sinda and Kiernan came across rather young to me. I know they've been friends since childhood, but their progression from friendship to love seemed awkward to me. (view spoiler)[And then all of a sudden they're engaged at the end. (hide spoiler)]"
5,"4.5 stars!! 
 I enjoyed this a lot more than I originally expected. This book was a real page turner and was honestly just a fun read. Learning about this world and the selection was so interesting to me. 
 This book is not a literary master piece, but it is a fun read that is very enjoyable. It is not long and is easy to read. 
 The characters were pretty good I think!! The plot really kept me going but I enjoyed the characters as well. America wasn't that annoying... I heard bad things about her character but I think she was fine. But then again this is the first book so I'm excited to see how she develops as a character. 
 Aspen I loved at the beginning but after what happened... I just didn't like him at all and didn't want him even in the story anymore. 
 Prince Maxon I enjoyed. He was very gallant and respectful. but then again what did I expect from a prince. He really honored a girls word and I respect him for that. We didn't get to know him to well but I'm excited to see what secrets or stories will surface about him in the next books. I am definitely routing for Him and America. 
 Americas relationship with her maids I thought was really nice. She wasn't rude to them, she helped them out and vise-versa. I also enjoyed reading about all the maids personality's. 
 All the other girls in the selection were fine. Celeste really did piss me off though. 
 but overall I recommend this book. I thought it was really fun and personally it brings out all the inner-girly in me. I really like reading about the outfits, hair, and makeup."
4,"Detective Gabriel Ashby has always thought of himself as straight, so the sudden case of intense lust he develops for notorious gang leader Angelo Pagan when facing him in the interrogation room has him more than a little flustered. He doesn't get all that much time to consider this new madness in his life, however, as only a few days later a warehouse raid goes south and the unlikely object of his desire shoots him and puts him in the hospital. As Gabe is recovering at home weeks later, an unexpected guest drops by: turns out Gabe is not the only one experiencing an overwhelming attraction towards a man on the other side of the law. The secret affair they embark on is a dangerous game to play for both of them, one that is more than likely headed straight for disaster. 
 Action, angst, and steamy goodness - a lot of steamy goodness. I'll have more of this, please! Also, I'm very much hoping one of the next books will feature Kane as a protagonist - the poor man is very much in need of a HEA."
4,"I love the story - dealing with poverty, heartbreak and disability, taking care of family and feeling like you don't deserve anything good. 
 The characters are all great - I would love to read all their stories - Slate's especially. I love how they evolve and mature throughout the book. 
 The only thing that I don't like is the way the dialogues are written at some points - a little bit too many exclamation point for my taste. Also, the whole start somewhere in the middle of the events, get back to the beginning and then continue to the time presented in the prologue is just necessary."
3,"It was a fast read. I think it was the best book for the 8-12 age group because it was very light and though it was an evil kingdom it was very humorous and fun. This book did not focus much on the plot. It was more about the development of characters in the book. The plot only thickened in the latter half of the book and the climax was one of the quickest climaxes I have ever read. 
 I don't know. I was expecting more from this book and it brought down all my expectations unfortunately. It was ok. Yes, the characters were well developed and you get the feeling of the disappointment from their parents and being trapped in their parent's shadow. I don't get the point of Ben being in this book except for that great idea at the end of the book which was the only monumental thing he did. 
 The people in the Isle of Lost were extremely mild for people who had been trapped in this place for ages. I mean what happened to all the anger and spite and just pure evil. 
 I thought the ending was quite pointless. I mean they didn't even get the sceptor. Their parents were still disappointed in them and they still believed in evil. The only thing that sorta changed was that they were sort of friends, not even true friends, just sorta friends. 
 Anyways I thought the book was ok and there's nothing more I can write about it."
5,"The frequent comparisons between this book and A.S. Byatt's Possession are, I believe, misguided. Although both involve dual timelines and long-hidden secrets, Hunter's book focuses on memory, and eschews satire and verbal pyrotechnics. Instead, she takes us inside the ghosts? shades? spirits? of the long-dead actors in a story connected to a long-shuttered Victorian asylum and a Victorian botanist. She shades struggle to remember who they were, and how their stories intertwined. So does archivist Jane Standen, whose dissertation included the asylum, and whose job is ending at the museum where she works is closing. 
 She has long been haunted by the disappearance of a girl from the asylum, known only as N, when she and two men walked to the botanist's house. The men returned; the girl did not. When Jane learns who is to speak at the gala for the museum's closing, she flees: The speaker, Jane's first crush, was the father of a little girl, Lily, who disappeared during a walk in the woods - when Jane was babysitting her. Jane goes to the village where both disappearances happened, searching for clues to the disappearance of N, and for clues to the tragedy that has defined her for many years. 
 An archivist preserves and sorts artifacts that keep the stories of a place and its residents alive. Some stories are more personal than others. N's disappearance might not have caught Jane's attention had Lily not disappeared. Others are less so, at least on the surface. The new owners of the botanist's house are recreating his gardens to be as they were in his lifetime. 
 As Jane reads the letters, journals, and logbooks, looking for clues into N's life and disappearance, the shades begin to recover their essences. As Jane begins a relationship with one of the gardeners, they also begin to remember how it felt to be alive, how their senses defined them. 
 The reader gets to absorb complexity in both timelines, and sees how Jane becomes more solid and complex as she assembles clues and allows the present - with risks and uncertainty - to to affect her as much as the past. 
 I was particularly taken by side-stories about the village and villagers, past and present, which deepened the theme of memory. One example: local miners who gather to remember their experiences as others, trapped, their stories told by the media, are in the long process of being rescued. The subterranean story illuminates the hope for salvation when the men can be brought to the surface to tell their own stories. 
 So, yes, this book is not Possession. Instead, it is a subtle tale of duality and memory, discovery and connection, which shines in its own, elegant, ultimately beautiful terms. 
 I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley, and this is an unbiased review."
4,This book. My heart aches.
4,"Short but powerful book about life, death, and loneliness in a small town. I'd never read this author's work, so I was unfamiliar with his style or the world he'd created in Holt, Colorado, but I still enjoyed this book quite a bit."
4,"I don't read sci-fi much (I'm not sure why, I probably should read more), but I found this book pretty great in all its science fictiony tech and weirdness. The settings and tech (including psychic/psitek, mech/mektek and biological/bitek) were really interesting, however as a whole, the book was somewhat let down by the characters. The main character, Khemri, seemed plagued by stereotypes, and the much more fascinating side characters seemed to have a lot less ""screen time"". 
 Still, a great book and I would be interested to see Garth Nix do more Sci Fi as well as his fantasy series."
3,"Review copy provided via NetGalley 
 Why I Read this Book: This is a pretty good erotic romance series, with Backstage Pass (book one) being my favorite. I find it intriguing to read about rock stars and their love affairs. 
 What I Liked: Hot Ticket is Jace's book and we get to find out about all the skeletons in his closet, and BOY were there some skeletons! It was endearing to see Jace's character develop and overcome his demons. There's quit a bit of back story in Jace's life. We see him evolve, from someone who thinks very little of himself to someone with more self esteem. 
 Aggie was a great character. I loved her Mistress V side. It was interesting to read the parts when she was in her dominatrix role. Her ability to turn on her Mistress V persona at any given moment and with a snap of the fingers was fun to read. 
 I like keeping up to date on the other band members. Brian and Myrna got some page time as well as Sed and Jessica. 
 What I Didn't Like: I had a big problem with the beginning of Hot Ticket, big enough that I almost did not finish the book (in which I would have then given up on this series altogether). The first 15% of the book (until chapter 6) rehashed a story arc, make that TWO story arcs, that played out in Rock Hard (book 2 of the series). I kept thinking to myself, 'wait a minute, haven't I read this before?'. Turns out I had. I stuck it out a little longer and was relieved when the recapping passed and the primary focus returned to Jace and Aggie (since Hot Ticket is their book). 
 Aggie's mom was too kooky for me. She was annoying as hell and I couldn't wait for her to go away (exit page left!). But really, all that means is that Olivia Cunning wrote a disturbing, yet convincing, portrayal of a non-present-except-when-it-suits-her kind of mother. 
 Memorable Moments: 
 Within seconds of meeting a man, Aggie could assign him to one of two lists. 
 List A: Men Not Worth My Time. 
 List B: Men I'd Like to Fuck. 
 --- 
 ""I'll call you dog, slut, slave, pussy, bastard, Batman, whatever you like."" 
 Overall Impression: Hot Ticket didn't start out well for me but redeemed itself just before I was ready to throw in the towel on this book (and ultimately this series). Once the spotlight was brought back to Jace and Aggie, it was a good read. Just to note: this is an erotic romance novel. There is BDSM; there is anal play; there is a threesome (m/f/m). There were some parts that weren't my cup of tea but hey, this is a series about rock stars and the heroine is a dominatrix so I guess it's to be expected. It's also worth mentioning that it is strongly recommended (by other readers as well as myself) that this series be read in the order that Olivia Cunning meant it to be read in - with Double Time read as the 5th book - and not in the order the books were released (Double Time was released after book 2). I don't understand the reasoning for Double Time's out-of-order release but if read in the order of release, it can ruin both Hot Ticket and Wicked Beat (book 4 in the series) by spoiling each of their resulting HEAs."
3,I picked this book up because of the cover but couldnt put it down once I started. I liked the characters and the uniqueness of the story.
4,"Much funnier than I ever expected, and even a little a snarky! Jane got off to a great start with this, though you can see where she can improve with her writing over time. I felt the end a little clunky but of course it wrapped up satisfactorily. Overall very surprised how much I enjoyed this."
5,"Mindy is honest, endearing, inspirational, and completely hilarious! I want more!"
4,"This was an unexpected super fun read! I would probably never have picked it up without a Goodreads recommendation (I'm sick of girls in frilly dresses on book covers as the story inside these books is often terrible) but I'm so glad I did. 
 Really good characters, an interesting story line, good romantic build up without the instalove, and I can't wait for the sequel. I think there's still some room for improvements, but a solid 4 stars."
5,"The Song of Achilles is a marvelous retelling of the story of, well, Achilles, but more importantly: Patroclus. When Patroclus, an awkward kid / an even more awkward prince, accidentally kills another boy, he is exiled by his father and sent to Phthia, where he has to live with king Peleus and his famous son, Achilles, who is destined to be the world's greatest warrior. The two become close friends and more, but then the Trojan war breaks loose and Achilles' hunger for fame starts to tear them apart. 
 I LOVED this one. I'm a big lover of Greek mythology and literature, except for the fact that it's often too factual and almost robotic; most characters are killing machines instead of men. This novel perfectly combined the gorgeous complexity of Greek mythology and strong characters with detailed and perfectly fleshed out emotions. 
 It's not easy to turn often awful men into characters this great. Patroclus is too sweet for this world, and Achilles is - in Patroclus' words - a flood. They were very captivating and even more when they were together. I loved watching them grow up together, I loved seeing their relationship mature and steady; it went from childish curiosity to a heart-wrenching bond, which I liked. 
 I loved the ending as well. It burned bright, worked out wonderfully, and made me cry a bit too. (I told my family my contacts were really dry.) (They weren't.) 
 Thank you, Madeleine Miller, for this interesting and thoughtful retelling of their story. Novels like these remind me why I like to study Latin this much."
5,Sabin did very well! I dare say very very well ;) another great one from Ms. Showalter! Loved it to bits and all the new revelations are causing the wheels in my head to turn making me so dizzy that I have to grab onto the shelf next to me and hold on onto the next book of this series! Can't wait for more!
4,"Irony is a bitch in this story. Seriously. Depressing ending, but still a good read."
4,So happy the boyfriend understands me crying over books. Review to come.
3,"I now have the audio, so hopefully I will finally finish this book. Let me first start by saying Anthony Heald did an excellent job as narrator. He truly brought the characters and their emotion to life. I love Russian literature, but Crime and Punishment is a totally different work. There is much to ponder on and assess while reading, and I guess that is why I felt exhausted when I finally finished. Of course it's well written and a classic, but there is more. There's the evil crime, the trying to justify the crime, and finally the punishment that led to redemption."
4,"Enjoyed this one way more than I thought I might. If you like kickass PI mysteries with a good mix of vampires and other supernaturals, this one is well worth a read. I got quite caught up in it and read it in two days and I'm going to start the second right away."
5,Fantastic second book in the series.
5,"I really enjoyed the story of Rue and Eriq. I'm a sucker for romances that involve kids/families anyway, and the idea of these two guys dealing with a newborn, when neither of them have any experience at all, was very cute. I must admit that the crisis/angst point about killed me, but it was resolved happily. I liked the slow build of the romance--there was no insta-love here, and jealous Rue was kind of hot. ;-) 5 stars from me"
2,"Amplified was just a quick YA contemporary read for me because I wanted a quick read. It was a little shaky in the beginning, and I wasn't a fan of the writing style but I did get into it in the middle more. Still, though interesting, the descriptive writing of the guitar playing was a little distracting for me. Maybe it was just me but I just didn't really dig the whole music being like driving through a tunnel or what ever. Too many metaphors, that's the word I was looking for. Amplified had too many metaphors! 
 The main characters Jasmine transformed too quickly as well. At first her stage fright and anxiety were epic, then, all of a sudden after a week of practicing, it was fine. Totally believable but if the book didn't oversell her fear in the beginning, might have worked. 
 All in all, I found some flaws, I found some annoyances but I did laugh a little at times. And because it was a bit funny and it did entertain me a little, I will say I liked it. Will I pick up the sequel for this? Maybe.... and I'm not saying I won't, that's for sure."
5,"4 - 4.5 Stars 
 Let's start with the fact that Renee has a gift of beauty with her words. 
 Now let's jump right to Mia. Argh!!! For most of the book I was so frustrated with her. 
 I get her baggage. I really do but come on Will was awesome and why can't she see that. They were so drawn together yet she kept pushing them apart. 
 Will was loving, talented, super sweet and patient. 
 For Mia she was so stuck with her idealisms that she couldn't see the reality that was right in front of her. 
 Thank goodness Will saw the potential. 
 It took Mia a long time to find herself, but the journey was worth it. 
 Within Mia's journey she found love and family where she least expected it. Soulmates and destiny are a powerful thing.

4,So funny and so cute. Nice quick book to read after you haven't gotten to read anything in ages
3,It's kinda an odd way to end a series if you ask me. I'm glad the flock is safe but dang...talk about the world going to hell
3,"2.7 
 Even if I don't like things that happen, because it's absurd, stupid or just too much drama, there's something about Isis that I like, she's full of problems but is badass and funny (sometimes toooo much)"
4,"Waking up in a strange room, strapped down, disoriented--it sounds more like the opening of a prime-time drama than a plausible real-life occurrence, but it's the hook Susannah Cahalan uses to draw you in to the story of how her brain went haywire. 
 Cahalan may be uniquely qualified to write this book--besides the obvious--because she's a journalist by trade, experienced in combining the personal narrative and scientific information necessary to making this a compelling read. 
 The actual story--account, tale, memoir, whatever--starts with the first hint of Cahalan's ""madness,"" a simple bug bite that may not have existed, and introduces her, along with her job, history, setting, and supporting characters in the form of boyfriend, coworkers and family. 
 After an initially intriguing pull--the madness, of course, appearing right as we start--many chapters in mid-beginning lag, as we see Cahalan's madness manifest, but no breakthrough or explanation follows. Apparently true-to-life so it's hard to complain, but from a purely selfish standpoint as a reader I was eager to move on. 
 Once she's in the hospital, her ""month of madness"" going full steam ahead, Cahalan's paragraphs describing her paranoia and then-increasingly-dim future are absolutely haunting. It's also where the book picks up steam, as we are able to learn more about the science and history and intermingles with Cahalan's condition, which was often mistaken as schizophrenia or another mental illness. 
 I wouldn't call it a light read or entertaining, but definitely interesting and informative, especially for anyone interested in how illness can affect the brain/behavior, or mimic mental illness."
4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 4.5 stars - 
 I loved this book so much! Once the action got started I was just so excited to hear more about the story every single chance I got. 
 **************SPOILERS BELOW************* 
 ***************************************** 
 ***************************************** 
 The only thing that shaved off that half star was that the ""twist"" at the end was pretty obvious almost from the beginning. It started off as a ""I know Mira likes to mess with her main characters, so Sal is probably a parasite"". After that the whole book turned into me trying to figure out the logistics of how Sal is already a parasite. Once we met Adam and Tanzy it was pretty much solidified on how it happened. Even though I was expecting a twist from Mira, I'm feeling like it would have been pretty obvious to anyone even if they didn't expect shenanigans from Mira 
 Overall though, it was such a fun ride and I can't wait for the next book! Ahhh!"
5,"Just like the summary said, Amelie is infected and while reading this book, it didn't feel like she was going to make it or not. I suggest defiantly read this book, as it is very important in the series and is a crucial step in the series long-running story. Like the last book, this book might make you cry because of the sad parts in it. The other books in this series were of course drama- filled but they always had some light in them, you know? But I find this book filled with only black, dark events and drama and stripped of happiness for the gang and especially Claire. I think the title, Black Dawn , is amazingly appropriate and well thought for this book because its exactly that, black."

 ** This is the novella between the first and seconds books in the Shatter Me series. There may be spoilers in this review for Shatter Me, the first book in the series. ** 
 After Shatter Me... 
 While I had some minor issues overall with Shatter Me, the cliffhanger ending had me wanting more! (view spoiler)[I loved the X-men feel of the ending! (hide spoiler)]Directly after reading the ending, I wanted to get my hands on this novella ASAP. But when I realized that the only way for me to get my hands on it was to buy it - my library didn't have a copy - I kind of hemmed and hawed over the decision. Not that it was expensive, I just wasn't sure if I wanted the novella badly enough to buy it. I've become quite frugal over the years and I don't have much of a book buying habit anymore. (Now that I'm blogging, it's been hard to resist new books though!) The idea of buying a book I wasn't sure I would like didn't sit well with me. 
 Life's full of little surprises... 
 I mentioned my indecision to Jessie @ Novel Heartbeat because I knew she was a fan of the series. And what did she do? Surprise the hell out of me by gifting it to me! Shameless book pushing she called it ;) (THANK YOU!!! <3<3<3) She wanted to be sure I read this one because it is all from Warner's point of view - and she ships Warner and Juliette! I'm so glad she gifted my this because I hated Warner in the first book, and now I'm a lot more understanding of him and his actions. 
 Getting to know Warner... 
 In the first book, Warner is completely terrible and horribly mean to Juliette, which is why I hated him so much! None of the things he did made sense to me - the only possible explanation was he was just a terrible human being. I was so confounded to hear that Juliette and Warner were an OTP for some people (hehe, Jessi!)! It was just mind boggling - but I knew there had to be more to the story than just what I read in the first book. Reading this book from Warner's POV really opened my eyes to why he is the way he is, and why he did the things he did in the first book. (view spoiler)[ Needless to say, things are not what they seem! Warner had reasons for doing exactly the things he did, and we get to understand why he couldn't tell her the truth too! We also learn about Warner's relationship with his father, which I found to be intriguing- explains a lot about Warner too. (hide spoiler)] 
 In the end... 
 In Shatter Me, I didn't understand Warner's infatuation with Juliette AT ALL. His obsession with her just seemed so weird and out in left field. I am definitely more understanding of his feelings towards Juliette now and I'm interested to see where that goes. I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND see how Julliette falls for Warner at this point - because she doesn't understand him like I do after reading this novella - at least not yet!. I'm interested to see how the relationship between Juliette and Warner unfolds and how Juliette learns to appreciate Warner. I'm very intrigued by this possible ship! But I'm still not sure I buy it. Yet. ;) 
 Do you ship Warner??"
3,"I'm not going lower my rating of Eclipse after my reread, as when I did after rereading Twilight and New Moon. I think Eclipse is my favourite book of the series, and that's basically because of one thing: stuff happens. 
 There's a lot going on in Eclipse: there's someone in Bella's bedroom stealing her stuff for her scent, Victoria is still chasing her and there is a vampire army killing people in Seattle. It takes Bella about 400 pages to find out that it's actually Victoria who is creating the army and that someone from the army was in her bedroom, but from that point on, it's getting good and exciting. 
 Then Bella has other personal issues to deal with: is she going to chose Edward or Jacob? Well, I think that choise was pretty obvious throughout the whole book. After all, what on earth would Breaking Dawn be about? Another 'omg depression I miss Edward' book? ;) 
 So, yes, I actually found myself liking Eclipse. The only things that REALLY bothered me, were the constant Wuthering Heights references. There are tons of reviews explaining that Eclipse is nowhere near WH so I'm not going to be excessive on this part, but it's just not right. Both Edward and Jacob show some of Heathcliff's characteristics (Edward is the one the father dissaproves, Jacob is the irrational beast), and also some of Linton's (Edward just cares about making Bella happy, he's the obvious choice for the readers, Jacob is the obvious choice for the father, etc.) though in the book, Edward is seen as Heathcliff and Jacob is Linton. So that's not completely straight, but what bothered me most is that Bella identifies with Cathy though she is NOTHING like her. Catherine is the most selfish character ever, while Bella is the most selfless and only trying to make everyone happy. 
 This didn't bother me when I read this book two years ago because I wasn't familiar with the story of Wuthering Heights, but now, I found it greatly annoying. Just cut it out, Stephenie. But apart from that, I enjoyed Eclipse!"
3,"3.5 just don't know stars 
 When she is lucid enough she doesn't know where she is, she knows she's in a crate. She knows she is being taken, but from where and by whom is unknown. She knows she's not alone and she knows that she is scared. She allow knows that she has to stay alert and collected if she's going to survive. 
 Master William has taken thirteen girls. The reason is cloaked in mystery, but there is something about his actions that lack malice. Staying in the shadows he places the thirteen girls into groups, each given a task, each to learn to trust and avoid punishments. But one girl, one that is broken and fragile. She's one of four, the four that are expected to break the most - the group that remembers nothing of who they were. Escaping was her goal, now that she's seen William she wants something more than merely her memories back and her freedom. She wants him. 
 I wanted to love this story. It seemed that for everything I loved there was something that left me wanting more. I have seen so many reviews that are clear love or hate statements and I find myself in the middle; slightly leaning towards loving more than hating. William's character starts off the story as a thirteen year old boy in the prologue as we see the event that his going to shape his life. But then we flash forward to him as an adult and now in possession of thirteen girls. Each one seems broken and in need of saving. It becomes clear pretty easily what William's intentions are. 
 This is part that I leaned towards disliking. I love a dark hero, but I love when a true villain can escape the darkness for light. Redemption through his actions. The feeling that tears you up inside when you know you shouldn't find yourself falling for him. For me, William was never that dark hero. Confused, screwed up... misguided... yes, but dark in the sense of a villain... nope. 
 I can say that I was not able to put this down, I was intrigued enough to continue on with the story to see where it was going. But even after trying to figure out what impression this story left with me, I am still just stuck in the middle. I didn't love it and yet I didn't hate it. I think I just expected this to be something different than what it was."
4,"Maud Horsham is the most unreliable narrator you'll ever meet - the poor woman is an octogenarian suffering from advanced dementia. She's also the only one that can solve the mystery of her missing sister Sukey, who vanished without trace after the war. Unfortunately Maud's mind is so fragmented she begins to confuse this event with the disappearance of her good friend Elizabeth. She's a determined, strong-willed lady though and we soon discover through flashbacks what really happened all those years ago. 
 Not only is this detective yarn absorbing, it is an utterly convincing portrayal of what life is like with such a debilitating disease. It's heartbreaking to see our hero so muddled and absent-minded, you feel her frustration when she can't even manage simple everyday tasks. I'm sure some some readers will find her forgetfulness repetitive and exasperating but for me it made the portrayal all the more convincing. On one level this novel is a gripping mystery, on another it's a harrowing depiction of mental illness."
4,"Despite the middle parts that slow down a little, the boring romance elements, and the minimal number of interesting characters, this is still great, engaging writing. On to number three!"
3,Very angsty. Really didn't like Brandt but maybe that was the point. I did like that this was an established couple working out their problems. I wish we would have had a little longer at the end with their reunion...seeing them work together more for their relationship. Otherwise good book:)
5,"*I received a free copy of this book in exchange for my honest opinion* 
 Ohh I like. 
 Hope's Daughter is set on a space station that was created after Earth was rendered inhabitable/humans started going extinct. Cassie now lives there with her parents and is just finishing secondary school when the story starts. Her best friend is already in love and can't understand why Cassie has never been interested in the other guys in their class/age group. Cassie already knows she's unusual.. she's been hearing voices and waking up with strange nightmares that she doesn't understand. She begins an unlikely relationship with a handsome classmate that's previously never given her a second glance (to her knowledge) named Balik, and as her work placement begins, things just get stranger. Her parents are acting weirder every day, and people that she knows would never elope and move to the married quarter on their own are suddenly gone with only their elopement announcement for explanation. 
 Man oh man, I really enjoyed this read. I was initially really turned off after reading the prologue. It was confusing and (to me) didn't seem to add anything to the book. So after I cruised past that, I was almost immediately hooked. I know some people said that they didn't like the pacing in the beginning, but I really enjoyed it. I'm a fan of slower paced beginnings as long as the characters are interesting and realistic, and these definitely were. I am a huge fan of the romance. It was wonderful to read, the slow pace, her wondering and wishing, everything. 
 I enjoyed the way that Cassie's abilities developed, I enjoyed Balik's kind of wild, angry side, and I even enjoyed the slightly slow naivety with which all of the adults faced the situation. Because in their environment, it rang completely true. Why should they question people that never rage against the system? 
 I'm anxiously awaiting the next book and highly recommend this one."
5,"This book is absolutely charming. I think that's the best adjective I can find to describe it. Written by Charlie Jane Anders of io9 fame, it reads with the speed and snark of an io9 article, but it also has a rich sense of both the fantasy and science fiction vault of tropes. Anders plays with these tropes, using them and suberting them to support what is essentially a Romeo & Juliet story if Romeo & Juliet both really loved their families and thought about the consequences of their rash actions and understood that being 13 is really not a time to make lifelong committments. 
 Basically, it's everything I love. 
 If I had to make a criticism, it would be that some of the pop culture references feel a little forced and stale already, and given that this book is set in the future, they just don't seem to make a lot of sense and forced me out of the story. It was, however, very easy to slip right back in to Patricia and Laurence's bizarre collision of worldviews, methodologies, and circles of allies. Anders weaves in a unique magic system that draws from folklore around the world as wel as a selection of near future technologies, all of which I want, making the bits between action scenes just as entertaining as the pivotal moments. 
 It's funny, sweet, heartbreaking, and thoughtful. A wonderful choice for fans of modern speculative fiction."
4,This is gorgeous! Very Brian Selznick-y. Good for tweens or teens who are willing to take their time relishing the details!
4,"Glass Sword really did not disappoint in terms of story and character building and the believable aspects of the story. I've heard so many complaints about Mare's personality in this book, but I do not agree with their disgruntlement. First off, I found Mare to be a very realistic character. Yes, she comes off as a bit self pitying and emotional, but that is because that is how SHE deals with the stress and responsibility placed on her. She has had to kill so many people and she continues to struggle with the guilt of placing her trust in the wrong person. Due to her error, Maven and the queen forced Cal to kill his own father, many rebels were massacred and now they are running for their lives after being placed in an arena to be executed. Near the middle/end, she is having a sort of break down where is becoming ruthless and distant from her friends and family as she tries to, ineffectually, protect them from sharing her burdens. 
 However, with the reappearance of (view spoiler)[ Julian Jacos (hide spoiler)] she is able to come to her senses and recuperate. (view spoiler)[ He (hide spoiler)] reasons with her much better than anyone else has been able to."
4,Hot and hilarious!
3,"The Spellman books are such jolly good fun, although I'm trying not to overdose on them (one every few months or so) because I did that with the Stephanie Plum books and now I can't get past Seven Up. 
 Mayhem continues as per usual in this second instalment to the Spellman adventures, with Izzie developing in interesting, non-MILFO (too young) ways. I'll see you again in another few months, Spellmans."
5,"Maya has a really strong and engaging voice throughout this book. I'm sure many people who have struggled to fit in and felt like they didn't have a place during school can identify with her. 
 What I like the most was that this book is true. Maya really did decide to conduct a social experiment and record how it went, and so the things that happen in this book are honest and so much stronger because of it. I loved reading about the ups and downs in her struggle to find out if really anyone can become popular, and the eventual realisation she comes to of what popularity really means. 
 It's great to see how her experiment touched the lives of so many people around her, the rewards she will get for publishing this book are thoroughly deserved. 
 I wish I'd read this book at the beginning of school, rather than when I was graduating!"
4,"4 Stars - Fantastic book 
 This review will be short but that in no way does that diminish how incredible this book is. It's quite a short book, packed full of information. I wouldn't consider myself a science buff by any means but it's always good to expand one's horizons, and I'm glad I did. The book starts of with the ancients and carries us through to more modern times. I really enjoyed the first chapter because it covered ground I was familiar with from previous history and science classes. After that, it was a learning adventure. I know I didn't fully understand the subject (and probably never will) but I'm glad I did it. Very interesting book, and easy to read all things considered."
0,"Heard the cover was finally out and had to come take a look! It's glorious, I need!"
5,"Don't pick up In Cold Blood if you think it's a detective story. There is no suspense, no mystery; we know who's dead and the fates of practically everyone involved right from the get go. In Cold Blood is something far more satisfying - a character study. The genius of Capote is revealed in the fact that in describing, in meticulous detail I might add, events of a rather gruesome nature, there are but glimpses of his own opinion seeping through. He was seemingly able to remain unbiased throughout the length of writing this masterpiece and that is something any writer/journalist or really any one who picks up a pen can learn from. 
 Pick this book up if you want to see how literature was ought to be written and to gain a minuscule of insight into how the human mind works."
0,"Read it and weep (because of all the laughing, I mean) 
 Better yet, sit back and let this guy read it for you.

 I don't even know why I even.... 
 ...this book had no absolutely no plot and I pretty much didn't give a crap about any of the characters. There wasn't even a war. It was stupid."
4,"3.75/5 
 i've been in a slump these past few months so managing to finish this novel in less than 24 hours is a huge shocker. which is to say, i thoroughly enjoyed NICK & NORAH'S INFINITE PLAYLIST. i didn't realize but i needed something light, fun, carefree, and cliche. this was exactly that. 
 this book was short and addictive. i loved the predictable situations and unique characters. although i didn't find anything deliberately special about this novel, i'm very grateful to have picked it up because i think it cured my slump. :))"
1,"It started out pretty good, but then there were way too many chapters about the romance that didn't do anything for the movement of the plot. Hey, I love romance in YA sci-fi, but it served absolutely nothing to the story. Maybe the romance might've served if I'd read further, but I read up to 40% into the book (ebook) and I got bored with it. Too many books, too little time. I'm moving on."
5,"Perfect. Seriously, that's all I have at the moment. Review to follow when I can gather my thoughts a bit more."
5,"** spoiler alert ** 
 Right when this came out I was running to the bookstore like a crazy woman to a get a copy. I think I scared one of the employees when I couldn't find a copy and I demanded he'd find me one. Anyway once it fell into my hands I immediately started to read it. This is what I LOVED and HATED about this book. 
 LOVED 
 ~Kate found the ritual of embodiment and was able to give Vincent a body again. 
 ~The historical facts and storytelling in this book was phenomenal I couldn't help but be glued to it for hours. 
 ~Just reading this book was awesome because I missed the characters a lot (especially Jules). 
 ~The curveball ending I did not see coming that Kate was a revenant and also the Champion (I had a hunch about this part but I wasn't sure). 
 ~In the end Charlotte and Ambrose ended up together finally. 
 HATED 
 ~Why the hell was Jules barely in the book! I know he got to be in his own novella DIE FOR HER but that doesn't mean he shouldn't be in the last book often! 
 ~That Jules went to New York and stayed there until the ending and went back again. I don't blame him but Jules is my favorite character and a part of me wanted him to be with Kate (sorry Vincent). 
 ~I know character have to die but it was really sad that Genevieve and Jean-Baptiste perished. I couldn't but cry for Gaspard. 
 Even though I had problems with this book I had to give it five stars. Amy is just a genius with storytelling. I am definitely going to keep these books close to my heart and I look forward to Amy's future work."
5,"Reviewed at http://www.mandikayereads.com/archive... 
 The Book of Blood and Shadow is one part DaVinci Code and one part National Treasure with a teensy bit of A Discovery of Witches thrown in. In other words - I LOVED IT. 
 This was my first book by Robin Wasserman, but it most definitely will not be my last. 
 I found myself completely caught up in Nora's translation of Elizabeth's letters - I wanted to know this woman and know her secrets. I wanted to know why Nora was important to not one, but two, secret societies. 
 I don't want to give away any of these secrets - they are yours to find for yourself. 
 The characters all found places in my heart - which really sucked, to be honest, because you never really knew who you could trust. 
 Bottom line - you should really read this book."
5,"My brain keeps telling me that most of this was a non-fiction textbook for humanity's future. I assume that either my memory is fuzzier than expected or that said brain has edited the memory to fit in with years of being a relatively smart woman surrounded by excruciatingly dumb/mean men and being horrified at how many copies they keep spawning while all of the intelligent ones breed minimally and responsibly. 
 Reading this in my teens made me start paying attention to how women were treated in fiction which of course opened my eyes to what was going on around me in real life. Even in fiction written by women, we marginalise or belittle ourselves (JK Rowling - why is a woman with a daughter writing novels with a male protagonist?) and to stumble upon this book at a time in my life when my peers were teasing me for reading Asimov & co (boys books) when they were reading things with Fabio on the cover has turned out to be incredibly important in shaping who I've become. 
 The book has its flaws, but the idea of a world designed by women has never lost its appeal."
4,I really enjoyed the back and fourth between Boston and Africa. Overall another good Rizzoli & Isles book.
3,cute and breezy.
4,"I loved this book. 
 I'm a sucker for good dystopias, and this one did not disappoint. 
 My favorite thing about it was that from the VERY beginning, it was non-stop action. There were no flat, boring explanations of things or backstories. Every detail you need to know is magically woven into the thrilling plot so perfectly without any distractions from the main action. 
 The romance in this book was intriguing. However, it's not really important to the plot. There is a love triangle and it does seem like its only purpose is to create that angst that everyone is so fond of. But unlike some novels, it's not too overdone here. The main character, Miranda, has a sense of purpose some heroines lack and she doesn't really let her confusing love life get in the way of the goal she's trying to accomplish. Although its purpose is questionable, I think the romance in this novel was well-done. Few books can give me butterflies, and this was one of them. 
 The plot was really strange--with psychic energy and clones and memory loss and whatnot. But it was SO. INTERESTING. I was constantly longing to know what was coming next and, along with Miranda, figure out what the heck was going on. Every page offered new clues to the mystery and kept me guessing and predicting what would happen next. This is my favorite kind of book. 
 Overall, I thought this was a fantastic read. I would recommend it to any fans of dystopias like Hunger Games, Divergent, Legend, etc. False Memory is an action-packed, thrilling read that anyone will enjoy."
4,"Because I Love You was a beautiful story about finding love, not only for others but also for yourself.. This book definitely pulled at my heartstrings! 
 We meet our main character, Andie, as she is finding out that she is indeed pregnant after having sex with her best friend, Carter. I found that Tori Rigby perfectly captures how it feels when someone so young finds out that they are having a child. I had my first child when I was only 19, not as young as Andie, but I still felt like the emotions Andie went through are some of the same as I did. So, of course it was easy for me to connect with her and root for her happy ending. 
 She is a very likable character even if you can't connect to her on that sort of level though. She's sweet, caring, and just has a huge heart while still having her flaws. In the beginning she definitely makes some selfish and impulsive decisions. 
 ""And I was strong. They couldn't hurt me unless I let them."" 
 Once the truth comes out, Andie is completely abandoned by her best friends including Carter. She is bullied and criticized. I truly felt sorry for her. As the story continues, Andie is forced to grow up quickly and make some tough decisions. It's never easy for her but she becomes incredibly brave while battling off the bullies and tackling each day one at a time. 
 Although Andie is abandoned by her best friends, she soon finds 2 people who truly care about her and her baby. Which I loved seeing how she fell in love with her baby and her 2 new friends, especially Neil. What would a YA contemporary be without a swoony book boyfriend? Neil is easy to like as he is hilarious and sarcastic, and brings out the best in Andie. Of course he has his flaws but he was always there for Andie when no one else was, and it's hard not to root for them. Then there's Jill, who I just loved because she's a big nerd like I am! The lengths Neil and Jill would go for Andie are what true friends are made for, and I was genuinely happy that she found them. 
 ""I love you enough to make sure you can build dreams of your own."" 
 There is so much more to Andie's story than whether or not she'll keep her baby. It's a heartfelt story about a young girl who grows into something more than she ever thought she could be. A story about finding love for more than one person. It's about friendship. It's about family. All of Andie's story will make you cry because it's real and honest as it deals with such sensitive subjects. 
 I found that the story wrapped up in a wonderful way. There were plenty of obstacles that Andie had to go through before reaching her deserving ending. I definitely cried a lot of happy tears, there was a lot of hope with the ending. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking fora heartfelt YA contemporary!"
4,"I've been fascinated by the sanitisation of fairytales for as long as I have been aware of the phenomenon; the evolution (to take one example) of Red Riding Hood, from a bawdy pub story to a cute morality tale for kids. It feels very appropriate to then read Carter, and find someone taking this full circle, using these stories as a springboard to explore darker, more sexual ideas (with a feminist twist, for added interest). The reader is left with a neat parcel of familiar tales that nonetheless defy expectation. It's a great collection. 
 Whilst I can't fault the prose (which jumps with virtuosity from voice to voice, genre to genre), the storytelling eventually begins to feel a little academic. In some ways this works well, as we get the same basic story (Beauty and the Beast, for example) retold twice in quick succession, as Carter dissects and subverts the original from all angles. But, somehow, this robs the endeavour of a little of its emotional impact. Similarly, Carter's pyrrhic retelling of The Snow Child is less a story than a barbed joke; I can appreciate it, but can't really say I enjoyed it. None of these are massive problems in and of themselves, and short story collections are almost always a mixed bag, but I did feel that something was a little lacking by the time I reached the end."
3,"Haha, I didn't know what the proposal would be! How very biting! I'm glad I wasn't spoiled before reading this. I think I'd have liked Jonathan Swift."
4,"We start where we left off, and we abruptly are shaken from the attempted 'normal' summer that Percy is trying to have and thrown into the epic ending, and we finally get to find out the entire prophecy. I will tell you, there are surprises, but as well written as the series is you know how it's going to end...right...well generally. I am a little sad to see this series end, but happy still that there's another series that has started that involves our favorite demigods. This book is a must if you've read the first 4 books. I means you've read four books, you should find out how everything ends. I loved this rendition of Greek mythology, I think it's a clever way to get younger kids into the myths and history. I like that Riordan made kids with 'learning disabilities' (ADHD & Dyslexia) into hero's, after all everyone has something special about them and they can impact the world greatly, even if they have difficulties in some areas. I like how we wrapped up this series, and I hope to read more of Riordan's books in the future."
4,"4.5 
 All I have to say is that while the first part was somewhat weird to follow, the rest delivered."

 Just this past week one of my friends told me the Beautiful Bastard series books are ""her crack."" I couldn't agree more. I find myself hopelessly addicted to each new pairing and their story. This series just keeps getting better and better. 
 What I loved most about Beautiful Player was the pairing of Hanna and Will. I liked that they had a history of friendship and that it slowly built into something more as he tried to pull her out of her shell. Their banter was amazing and I found myself chuckling with nearly every interaction... at least in the early stages. I loved how Hanna was so forth-coming and open about sex (and everything else) and how shocking Will found that. This might have been an unlikely pairing in the beginning, but it totally worked for me. They had great chemistry that eventually grew into steamy sexy times. 
 The only downside to this book was the lack of communication and thus the misunderstandings between these two. It was really frustrating at times, but not enough to change my feelings about the book. It just made me want to handcuff the two of them together and make them talk until they worked things out. I liked them so much together that it kinda sucked when they weren't. 
 One thing I love about series like this one is that with each new book, not only do we meet a new couple to cheer for, but we get to catch up with the couples from earlier in the series. I freaking love the bromance between the men in this series. It, much like the books themselves, gets better with each new installment. I love how these guys give each other a hard time, but always with their best interests at heart. There's something so real about the friendships in this book. I swear, I read them nearly as much for the friendships as I do the couplings. 
 Now that I'm caught up on all the full-length novels, it's time to conquer the novellas. :)"
5,"This is one of the very few novels that took my breath away and afterwards I needed to reflect on my life. I loved the way that the novel was written mostly through diary entries. It felt like I had made a deeper connection with the main character, Christine. This going to be the novel that I recommend to everyone! If you are hesitant about reading it, read it!"
4,"This is book that got me into YA and started my obsession with Fae. 
 I see comparisions with Twilight. This is statement I am totally against-and I respect different opinions, even ones that give 1 star. Characters are different, and fae-oh my god, fae!- would destroy vamps any day. 
 Style of writing- Oh my, pure beauty. It shifts slowly from etched in ground type of real life, as if narrator is next to you, over strange mix of that and next, like abstract image, between dream and reality, to otherworldly lyrical style. 
 World building- I could feel it. ideas Maggie had are awesome. You feel fey hiding in shadows and twilight ( only thing that can be called common to that series). 
 Plot- This is little worse than other's, prompting me to give 3 stars, but given my opinion was 3.5, here you go. At centre is romance. While it was nice, it is classic triangle, and not enough time. On other side, cloverhand and faerie Queen's [ who herself is mortal] fear for her rule are awesome. 
 Originality-Again romance is seen and been, but other points are awesome. I especially like unlikely theme she choose-Irish harpist! awesome, great for those in real life and nice way to tie with legends. 
 Characters-deirdre is smart, not overly snarky, and great. Luke is tormented but not wangsty. Their relationship took little time-only complaint. James is wiseass but not annoying. Grandma is strict and badass. faeries are enchanting and cruel. Their Queen is paranoic but surely awesome- I would loved to see more of her."
5,"When I was in elementary school I used to get called a speed reader because I could plow through books in less than a day. As I grew a bit, I found that that tendency sort of withered away. (My theory is that the hellhole of middle school took most of the fun out of everything, including reading.) But when I discovered Stephen King, I became the speed-reader again. And Song of Susannah is one of the easiest books to speed through. Its pace is fast and its prose is smart and damn, it was just a good book. 
 The interactions between Susannah and Mia are great. I love when Mia, daughter of none, is subdued by the challenges of the modern world and Susannah has to spell things out for her. I also just love being in Susannah's head and in her perspective. The Detta Walker cameos were also a nice touch, and the idea that Odetta Holmes is just another one of Susannah's alters now. I really love Susannah. She's a fantastic character and I'm glad she got to be the focus of this book. However the Dark Tower series ends, I'm going to cry because I love all of the characters so much. (I almost did cry when I was sure Jake would die near the end of this book.)"
5,"I was really looking forward to this book. But also saddened that it is the second to the last one. The Series is coming to an end after the next book. I really will miss the series, with all it's up and downs though out the books. 
 That being said things are heating up and the stakes are higher than ever. Also some things are starting to wind down the closer we get. 
 I really enjoyed this book A LOT. Merit is stronger than ever and it is hard to believe that it has been only a year since she became a vampire. She grown quite a bit and in this book more than ever she knows who and what she is. To herself, Ethan the house and her family and friends. 
 Ethan almost surprises me in every book with his action, that doesn't mean always good though. He had some truly too stupid to live moments in this book. Some things, I couldn't believe I reading the things he done other moments I could not have been prouder of him. He really was up and down in this book but, it all came from a good spot and that is all the matters in my book.

5,"Yes, I am crying."
4,"Ooh --I like Barbara Pym! Her writing style is deceptively simple, and thoroughly enjoyable. 
 Mildred is an unattached woman of a certain age, and in the society of this time and place, the role of such excellent women seems to be to make themselves available for everyone else. In the course of her hum-drum life being upset by the appearance of some volatile newcomers to the neighborhood, Mildred begins to question society's expectations. 
 ""Perhaps there can be too much making of cups of tea, I thought, as I watched Miss Statham filling the heavy teapot. Did we really need a cup of tea? 
 ""'Oh, but Byron was such a splendid romantic person,' said Winifred, 'and that's the main thing, isn't it?' 'Is it really?' I asked, still determined that I would not be forced to admire Mrs. Gray. 'Doesn't one look for other qualities in people?'"" 
 I enjoyed spending time with Mildred. She's witty and ironically self-deprecating. While hoping for something more, she accepts her role with a sort of eye to the absurdity of it all. She looks at the lives of people she is supposed to want to be like, and tells us what she sees. In the end, we realize she has more going for her than the rest of them put together."
0,"I knew I would love this book going in. I had discovered Rupi Kaur through some social media a while back and have seen some of these poems on her instagram. I wasn't wrong. 
 This is a very freeform kind of poetry. Some are only a few lines and some fill the whole page. They are accessible, but emotionally charged. 
 I loved the chapters or sections of the book, being separated into the hurting, the loving, the breaking, the healing, when I want to find something to fit a mood I know where to start searching. 
 Many times I found myself reading poems out loud to my daughter, my husband, my friends, because they expressed feelings I had felt in a way that I wanted to share. They have instigated beautiful conversations. I suggest you read the ones you love out loud to the people you love."
3,"Not your average slash. This is a story of a very lonely odd man named Will who misses his ex boyfriend Parker. He has come out to some small god forsaken island to see if they can't work it out. An attractive man named Aiden gives him a boat ride and claims he remembers Will from his youth. Will has never been to the island and ignores his new attraction, after all he's here for Parker. Crawling back to your ex is never a good idea, but it's especially horrid when you get to the door and find out the hard way that they have moved on. In Parkers case, with a beautiful woman named Sina. Buuuuurn! 
 Distraught, Will runs through the forest in tears barely reaching a small cabin where a man named Cyrus lets him in before hypothermia set in. Cyrus starts off kind to Will and insinuates himself as Will's new boyfriend, he says he has been waiting years for Will to return to the island. Cyrus shows Will his true form as a cephalopod which goes over reasonably well because Will is a very odd guy. Other islanders seem to remember him too, which freaks Will out enough to want to get off the island. But by this time Cyrus has had his tentacles in Will, literally, and they secrete toxins that make him biddable. 
 Aiden comes by when Cyrus is not around to help Will remember his past. The more Will remembers the more Cyrus lets his mask drop and shows the monster, THE MONSTER!!!, he is. The real Cyrus is Stephen King levels of evil bad guy. The kind of guy who would casually, seriously, sociopathically, discuss cutting your arms off because you won't need them since he has eight with which to care for you. Shiver. (view spoiler)[Cyrus dies horribly. I was really glad about that. (hide spoiler)] This book was everything it said it was so reader be warned... or titillated."
1,"""It was about damn time something happened."" Page 297 
 That sentence sums up how I was feeling as I trudged through this dreary lifeless coming-of-age tale of wizards in the modern world. Unfortunately, nothing amazing happened for the remaining 105 pages. In this novel, Lev Grossman has created a thoroughly unlikable cast of characters. Supposedly geniuses, they never seem to think with their brains but on impulses and primal urges. Once in a while, the author touches on an idea that hinted at genius, but quickly flitted away from it again and returned to listening to these characters lament at their own depression and frustrations. There were a lot of side notes to the plot that could have contributed to the story, but they were mentioned once and forgotten. For the story being a fantasy novel, I found the descriptions lifeless and boring. Grossman was more concerned with detailing who slept with who and how many times. This book had potential, but due to lack of story progression, it was lost. This is definitely a story I will NOT seek out the next book in the series. As far as I am concerned, I simply want to forget this story ever happened."
3,"I wanted to read this after all the hype I heard about Dante Walker. I love male POV books, and, on top of that, Dante's labeled as an anti-hero. Even more intriguing! 
 He honestly wasn't that unlikeable, though; I never had a moment where I hated him. (I think Damon Salvatore in season 1 of The Vampire Diaries is a much better example of an anti-hero. He is awful.) If you've been reluctant to read this one because you've heard how terrible Dante is, don't let that deter you. He's a pussycat compared to Damon! (Oh, and Dante's voice is a little over the top for me... would have liked it to be toned down just a smidge.) 
 When the focus of the book shifted more in the direction of Dante as a person (or, well, a demon), that's when things picked up for me. We got to see more of what makes Dante tick, what his vulnerabilities are. He became more real. I cared what happened to him, and to Charlie. 
 This is a quick, fun read. If you're a fan of paranormal romance, male POVs, and/or demons, this is the book for you!"
3,"The villain is one of the creepiest characters I've ever read about in a novel. And the main character's best friend gets a big fat F in friendship. Ugh! I wanted to virtual punch her in face for not believing Rachel or supporting her when she needed help, and I'm a total pacifist normally! I was SERIOUSLY astonished that Rachel stayed friends with her. 
 The romance between Rachel and Kash is fun, but they also have to deal with several serious issues as their romance intensifies. 
 I like how the villain is dealt with even if at first I was like wait, WTF actually happened again? 
 I didn't realize beforehand that this is a planned series so I was pretty bummed with the cliffhanger ending. I would've waited until the series was closer to being finished before starting it if I had known that. 
 Oh well, I will definitely read the sequel to find out if Rachel & Kash get their HEA ending."
5,"'Because,' Coraline said, 'when you're scared but you still do it anyway, that's brave.' 
 Without a doubt one of the very BEST books I've read this year and for sometime. This is a timeless classic tale of bravery and courage in the face of overwhelming odds and mountainous opposition... where a scared lonely little girl had to save not only herself but her parents too from terrifying supernatural forces, and still never hesitated or panicked. She kept her cool and with her strong willpower & sharp intelligence vanquished the evil. Coraline was such a great character that several times I had to kept myself from yell out loud ""YES!!!"", she's was such an adorable and lovable little child that many a times I soo wanted to give her a hug and said to her, ""Everything's going to be alright, kid."" But I guess in the end she showed enough mental strength and valor that maybe I will need her memory to give me that encouragement and strength whenever everything's going downhill in my life. Coraline is hands down one of the best female literary characters I've had the pleasure to know in my whole life. 
 The writing of Neil Gaiman is just perfect for this book, his storytelling has that beautiful agelessness like when we as little kids used to listen to many heroic fairy tales from our parents... and this too is one of the best kinds of heroic fairy tale. But that doesn't mean its all light and fun, because the story is at times very disturbing, horrifying and dark; which is all the more admirable of Gaiman that he didn't try to sugarcoat a saccharine sweet children's tale, he understands the psychological strength of a child and presented a magnificent story as seen through a child's eye told to the eternal child in me, not from a grownup's point of view that many of the children authors make the mistake of. In the introduction of the book Gaiman told how and why he wrote the story, and I think this part sums up the greatness of this tale perfectly: 
 ""I'd wanted to write a story for my daughters that told them something I wished I'd known when I was a boy: that being brave doesn't mean you aren't scared. Being brave means you are scared, really scared, badly scared, and you do the right thing anyway. 
 So now, ten years later, I've started running into women who tell me that Coraline got them through hard times in their lives. That when they were scared they thought of Coraline, and they did the right thing anyway. And that, more than anything, makes it all worthwhile."" 
 I could never have said it better myself."

3,That was seriously the shortest yet cutest book I have ever read.
4,"Review from Elysian Fields. 
 Rated 3.5 out of 5 Stars 
 The first word that comes to mind when I think about this book is meh. I didn't realize that this was possible from a JLA book at all, let alone one about the fae. Sigh. The worst part of all of this is the fact that I cannot even pinpoint exactly what it is about Wicked that I don't like. It could possibly be that the synopsis is so similar to The Dark Elements Series that I just wasn't impressed with the idea in general. Or maybe the simple fact that the fae were portrayed to be mindless enemies with a taste for blood and little else. I was taught that the faerie world is a beautiful place; not some hell-like dimension that spawns mutant blood thirsty monster things. Ugh. I hated it, and I hate that I hated it, dammit! 
 The characters were well written, of course. This is still a JLA book we're talking about here! Ivy is the typical kick-your-ass protagonist that readers have come to know and love from this lady's books. Ivy has no problem with telling you like it is, and drop kicking your ass in the process. She is spunky, mouthy, outgoing, and all the things I wish I was! I thoroughly enjoyed her character, although she is so alike most of JLA's female protagonists. And then there is Ren. Oh, Ren. He is also JLA's typical male love interest; cocky in a confident sort of way, sexy as hell, and a complete pain in the ass. My dream boy wrapped up in a book cover. The fact that I didn't enjoy this book has nothing to do with Ren. Let's face it ladies, JLA can write the kind of book boyfriend that you have dreams about afterward. Sigh. 
 I really do wish that I could have fallen in love with this story. I wanted to. Maybe I unfairly built it up in my mind so much that let-down was inevitable? Or maybe it was just that repetitive and uneventful? Maybe I read far too many JLA books..?! If you read it and have an opinion, leave me a comment! I would love to hear what you folks thought of this one. Is it just me, or did this book kind of suck?! Muah!"
3,"3.5 stars 
 Mayfair Moon was an enjoyable enough read, and I'm always quite happy to be reading about werewolves, and this book definitely has it's fair share of some hot, sexy specimens, especially Isaac. 
 The main character, Adria is a likeable enough character, though slightly annoying at times, but not enough so to hinder my enjoyment of the book. 
 The romance bothered me though. There's an instant attraction on both sides, and from the way things were playing out, and some comments that were made by Isaac's family members, I felt we were heading towards an imprinting or bonding, which would have been fine with me, but when that turned out not to be the case, the romance just didn't work for me then. They're feeling were just too intense too quickly for my liking. Thankfully though, there were other points of interest which managed to hold my attention to this book. 
 Something happened at the end of this book and I think I know what it is, I'm just not sure who did it? I'm really interested in seeing how that will play out, because no matter who did it, it's not really a good thing. I think there'll be hell to pay, especially from reading the blurb of book 2. 
 The secondary characters were also quite interesting, especially Harry and Zia, who became Adria's best friends. And then there's Alex, Adria's sister, who's living with the enemy family. So I'm definitely curious about the next book which I've already downloaded from Audible and I'm looking forward to listening to."
4,"A lot of divided reviews, so I'll put in my five cents worth. 
 I give it four stars. No, this is not great literature, far from it. I mean, c'mon, ""Dani Ripper""? What did you expect? What it is, is great entertainment. Locke is witty, clever, and tells a good story very well indeed. So, when I want something light, something fun, I'll read him again. And again."
5,"Many thanks to Norilana Books for the galley copy (via NetGalley). 
 Death has come to the kingdom of Lethe in search of his Cobweb Bride. Until he finds her, all forms of death--and ease from suffering--cease. Those on the verge of dying are stuck in perpetual limbo: animals remain alive after slaughter, soldiers continue to live after receiving fatal blows and wounds, and the sick and elderly are unable to succumb to the knell of disease and old age. Young women all over the kingdom must now seek Death--voluntarily or out of a strict sense of obligation--to put an end to this uncertainty and unrest. The quest for the Cobweb Bride is told from the viewpoints of a menagerie of characters: Claere (also referred to as the Infanta), the Grand Princess of the Realm; Marquis Vlau Fiomarre from the kingdom of Styx; Lord Beltain Chidair, the son of the Duke of Hoarfrost; and most importantly, Persephone (also known as Percy), the pitied and unremarkable middle daughter of Alann and Niobea, from the Village of Oarclaven. 
 This story really snuck up on me in the sense that I was hooked before I realized that I was. I don't want to say that it started off slowly; rather, Ms. Nazarian took the time to establish this world and its characters so that it was easy for me to be immersed in it and to truly know which character came from where and what function did he or she have in society. There is a handy guide of names and places at the end of the book, but I didn't need to refer to it. Ms. Nazarian's elegant prose eloquently captures the beautiful and dark facets of a harsh winter and its effects on the citizens of Lethe and the members of the Court, whether they are alive or in a suspended state of death. 
 Percy is the kind of character I have no difficulty rooting for. Quietly competent, she gets things done with little to no complaint. She has an inner strength that is easily overlooked due to her dowdy appearance and also because she is overshadowed by her sisters. Perhaps she even underestimates herself since it seems like everyone else does, including her own family members. The fact that she has a bond with Death adds another layer of interest. I'm eager to see how the rest of the story will unfold and how Percy will grow as a character now that she has realized her potential. 
 With prose full of imagery, diverse characters and an otherworldly plot, Cobweb Bride neatly lays the foundation for what is sure to be a fantastical tale."
4,"I think that I should clarify something before I go into this review. This book (and I'll explain in a minute) toke me over a month to read. I have two reasons for that: 1. This book was boring to me. I have been told before had that this first book is boring and that the rest of the trilogy is better. I believe that and I will read Clockwork Prince really soon (right after I finish Delirium in fact!), in preparation for City of Heavenly Fire. And 2. This book is like 500 pages and I read this at home (and it takes me longer to finish a book at home instead of at school so...yeah...). I did not hate this book at all! (I mean it's Cassandra Clare for goodness sakes). But I found this to be really boring probably because of the fact it toke me time to finish this, but let's get into the actual review. 
 This book does not have the greatest amount of action, I mean yes it does have its moments where there is a lot of action (view spoiler)[like the vampire scene at Camilla's(?) (hide spoiler)], but overall it just is boring. I don't really remember too much about this book even because it was really boring. 
 Now let's go to the characters. To be honest, I have a mixed reaction for all the characters. My favorite characters from this first book is Tessa and Henry. Tessa is just so relateable (and not just as a book reader but personality wise for me) and I can easily connect to her and that makes me love her a lot. And Henry...if you don't like Henry at least a little bit I don't know what I can do for you. Henry is just such a likeable character that I don't even know how to describe my love for him. 
 And then my two least favorite characters...one you all might be shocked by, but I have to give my reason(s) for hating them. My least favorite characters are Jessamine, and Will Herondale. I'm going to explain why I hate Will right now so that I won't get message about why I hate him. The reason that I hate Will is because whenever him and Tessa do something, he just is cruel to her and hurts her feelings and I'm just like 'Are you kidding me Will? Can you at least be nice for 30 seconds?'. I did like that he was funny, but I hated his arrogance and how he was mean to Tessa. I am sure that I will love him later in the series, but right now I hate Will. And then I hate Jessamine because she is just snotty and she believes that women should not be Shadowhunters and I just don't like it. I know that this is the late 1800s', but I would have liked he to stand up for herself as a warrior. 
 This book does have some interesting plot twists that I did not see coming at all! But it did not support much of how boring it was to me. Again, I will be reading Clockwork Prince, but I don't think I have high expectations for the next one (but I know I'll love it). 
 I have heard that people say that you should start with Clockwork Angel as the first book in the Shadowhunter World, but I think that if you really want to develop a love for this world like I do you might want to start with the Mortal Instruments (or at least City of Bones). 
 In the end, I gave Clockwork Angel a 4/5 stars. I love this world and the plot twists that occurred, but I found this book to be really boring and I either hated or didn't care for half the characters. I will read Clockwork Prince soon, but right I have little expectations since I didn't like this first book (even though I'll love it)."
3,"Very quick read, with several amusing short stories. A good way to get a Sookie fix while waiting in line for the latest full length book!"
4,"What can I say that would do Saga justice? This story is witty, funny, and full of plot twists like nobodies business. My boyfriend is the original owner of all our copies and given my natural nature to gravitate toward graphic novels I figured I would give them all a try. Boy, let me tell you: I was not disappointed! The only shame is that we have to wait for the latest volume to come out since we decided not to buy the comics individually. 
 I would recommend this story to ANYONE with a love of graphic novels, witty dialogue and beautifully crafted characters/worlds."
5,"THIS WAS BEAUTIFUL. My heart ached and soared with the story of Poppy and Rune. It's the kind of story that seemed impossible to happen but feeds people with so much HOPE. Hope that the world needs so much. 
 I couldn't help but remember A walk to remember as I read this book. It brought the same feeling to my heart, and I utterly loved it. I was ugly crying for this book for the last chapters, and I am not ashamed."
4,"I had no idea what to expect from JKR's adult writing (I skipped The Casual Vacancy based on what I heard about it), but I'm glad I gave this one a shot. 
 I enjoyed getting to know Cormoran Strike very much. Handled incorrectly he could have been a cliche (a Guy Noir Philip Marlowe knockoff), but fortunately he's a more complex character than that: Iraq War vet, missing a leg, former SIB, illegitimate son of a famous rock star and a famous groupie. The latter comes in handy, since he has half-siblings in various useful places that he can call on in a pinch. I like that his missing leg doesn't define him; it affects him, of course, but only in the same way that a bad shoulder or an old football injury would -- that is, it's an inconvenience more than anything else. He smokes constantly, which feels a bit ""old school"", but I guess smoking is a lot more prevalent in England than in the US these days 
 Intrepid assistant Robin is a little too pretty (perhaps the barest whiff of Mary Sue?), but there are hints that she too has some backstory that we don't yet know, that shapes/affects her character. I was rooting for her as she hesitantly tries to forge a path towards the career she wants. Her fiancee is a wanker, however. I hope she dumps him eventually. 
 Secondary characters are well-drawn, the various London environs are vividly evoked (if a bit heavy on the pubs), the plot is interesting and nicely crafted, and if you pay attention, the clues to the killer are there, sprinkled through the narrative. 
 Definitely made me want to read the next one in the series."
5,"Some subjects are so painful and dark- not romantic at all in fact- so it takes a talented writer to weave the two together to create a heartwarming, passionate and hope-filled story that is above all about love. Each book in this series introduces characters that need to heal and find that special someone who is right there to love them and encourage them along their path. In this case, the story swirls around two characters that were introduced in the first book, Nate and Jessie. 
 I didn't read the first book, but read the others in order since. I think this one would be fine as a standalone or out of order as it is only loosely connected to the series, but my recommendation is to stick with the order of the series as best because several of the minor characters were introduced in earlier books. 
 Nate is nearly eaten alive by trying to contain his emotions over growing up in a home rife with domestic violence and seeing evidence that his brother is on the cusp of continuing what their dad started. He is also confused about his sexual needs that, in his mind, tie in to his fears that he'll be just like his father. It is for these reasons that he has strict rules when he gets physical with women which he does often enough to get the manwhore label. His reputation is that of a one and done and as a daredevil with the adrenaline-filled stunts he engages in. But one night, he is brought up short when Jessie, his only female friend, pushes her way into the women's bathroom he is in with an anonymous hook-up. Having her seem him like that shakes him and he slowly starts to realize that he cares about her opinion because he has always cared about her as something more that he doesn't feel he can have. 
 Jessie and the gang from the tattoo shop she works at to help pay for college are pretty tight and they hang at the bar together once a week. This week, Jessie finally saw how Nate, the guy she calls Square, earned his reputation. His clean cut looks and the fact that he comes from money is generally not her thing, but the look in his eyes in that bathroom haunt her. There is more going on under the surface of Nate than she could ever imagine. She feels attracted to him and really wants to get to know the real Nate. A day trip to another town for her photography project with Nate as her guide brings her exactly what she wished for- and more. 
 Spending time with Jessie in his old town, opens up the painful past for Nate. They both open up actually and its scary, but freeing. An unexpected night in a hotel has him unleashing a bit of his dark side. Instead of scaring her or disgusting her, Jessie is right there urging him on. He draws back, confused and scared about what is going on. Jessie gives him space and encouragement, but each time he draws away it is hard on her too. Jessie shows him that it is okay to open up and trust others, to get help, and he starts to do that very thing. Change is hard and Nate feels lost. Jessie doesn't know how long she can keep putting her heart out there and if Nate can ever heal enough to take it and offer her his own heart too. 
 As I said, this one gets into some dark things with Nate's past, but it was an incredible journey of self-discovery, acceptance, courage, hope and love. I was amazed how the author told her tale without me once feeling it slid into useless drama or affectations of feeling. It was hot and passionate without that aspect overwhelming the story. All elements balanced well and the story was so well paced considering it was strongly character-driven. 
 Nate needed to heal and it was tough on him, but he was courageous and tender enough to do it. He had a reputation for being a shallow, rich boy user, but that wasn't even more than a thin veneer. I loved getting to know this guy through his first person narration. He was barely holding it together and trying so hard to do the right thing. I felt so sad for him that he mistook that his taste in dominating his sexual partner was the same as his dad's abusive nature. He berated himself and tried to hold back while all the while he was miserable. It was a vicious cycle. 
 Jessie came along and was his rock and the catalyst for change in him without being pushy, snarky or moody about it all. Jessie's experiences were so different, but she was a breath of fresh air. She didn't judge and she tried to be so patient and understanding even when her heart got involved. Jessie was mature and, for lack of a better term, seasoned in her experience with relationships and sex. She was honest and had so much to give. This made her perfect for a guy like Nate. I spent the last half of the book silently cheering him on to just take what she was holding out to him freely. 
 All in all, I was enchanted and all my emotions from laughter to tears were engaged. I keep saying it, because its true- this author and series are some of the best New Adult Contemporary Romance out there and I recommend it highly to those who enjoy this genre. Even though who prefer adult contemporary romance would probably enjoy these for the depth of the characters and plotting. 
 My thanks to Penguin Group for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review."
3,"I have to say that by now I've officially become hooked to Maria V. Snyder's writing. I've been very impressed so far with her books. 
 However I feel slightly disappointed with this book. 
 In Poison Study Yelena has already created a group of friends and enemies in Sitia and is still looking to capture the murderer Ferde from the previous novel. Yelena, Leif, and Moon Man go out searching on a lead and find more trouble than they bargain for. 
 Fire Study felt to me more like Magic Study part 2 than an entirely new book. I read the first several chapters fully engrossed in the story but after that I lost my interest and sort of skimmed through a lot in this book. There was a lot of Yelena just running around giving orders, getting captured, escaping, and then running from one bad situation to the next. I felt like I was reading it just to find out what happens at the end more than anything. Well, that and to get to the next scene with Valek. 
 I think that is another problem I had with this book too. I loved Poison study and Yelena's relationship with Valek, Ari, and Janco. I felt like Yelena grew to love Valek throughout the book and Valek was such an interesting character. I loved Ari and Janco's teasing personalities and something interesting was always happening when they were on the page. In Magic Study I didn't really care much for the characters being introduced but the plot was interesting and Valek did make appearances and played an important part towards the end of the book. In Fire Study Valek shows up but usually for very brief periods of time and their conversations mostly consist of 'How are you and what do we do next?' and then they just get snugly in bed. There isn't the banter like there was in Poison Study. Valek just shows up, saves Yelena, and then he's gone. Ari and Janco show up again but then they're gone again too. The plot didn't really interest me. It just felt like Yelena running from one problem to the next. I wanted less Yelena running around trying to save everyone and a little more time on the characters themselves. 
 I did like the series in general though and plan on reading more of Maria V. Snyder's books. I'm just kind of bummed about the ending not living up to my expectations."
5,"When my friend told me about this book a year ago, I said, ""Is it fiction? I thought her name was Helen Lane."" That was the name I remembered from both my cell biology textbook and my immunology lab class, where we learned to make hybridomas using HeLa cells. They said the cell line originally came from a woman who'd had cervical cancer, but there was no other info about her. Not surprising, patient privacy and all. I imagined that she'd knowingly donated them to science. Turns out that's not quite the case. 
 This book isn't fiction, but there were moments so sad, I wished it were. The donor's name was indeed Henrietta Lacks, the ""Helen Lane"" attribution having been an attempt to protect her identity. There was no such thing as informed consent back when the samples were taken and neither she nor her family got any notice of the successes that scientists had with her cells (though much of that was after she died) or any compensation. Because her name was kept under wraps, it was many years before her family heard about the HeLa cell line at all. When they were finally contacted, they were confused, frightened, and felt very much wronged. 
 One of the doctors said of Lacks: 
 ""From a clinical point of view, Mrs. Lacks never did well. ... As Charles Dickens said at the beginning of [A] Tale of Two Cities, 'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times."" But it was the best of times for science in that this very particular tumor gave rise to the HeLa cell line. ... For Mrs. Lacks and the family she left behind, it was the worst of times. Scientific progress and indeed progress of all kinds is often made at great cost, such as the sacrifice made by Henrietta Lacks."" 
 I won't give anything away, but the science lore in the book runs the gamut from inspiring to fascinating to horrifying. The stories of Henrietta and her children are heartbreaking, though there are some moments of hope, too. I came away feeling grateful to Skloot for writing this book and sharing the real story not only with the public, but with Lacks's family. It can't possibly make up for all they endured, but perhaps it could bring them some peace. There's now a foundation in place, funded in part by proceeds from the book, to help the Lacks descendents and others that were (or are descended from) uncompensated research subjects. I hope it does well for them."
3,"Summer of Sloane would make a good beach read. There is friendship (aside from the destroyed friendship with Mick) and romance and a little surfing and swimming too. There are also darker moments as Sloane deals with the pain and hurt she feels over the loss of her former best friend and boyfriend. Finn has some hardship in his own life with his overbearing father and family issues. 
 Sloane is a privileged teen from a well-to-do (but far from perfect) family. Her mom gives her and her twin brother Penn a new convertible and believes strongly in expensive retail therapy to help Sloane get over her sorrow. That aspect of Sloane's life is harder to connect with but her emotional struggles make it easier to relate to her. I could understand her anger and irritation with the constant texts and calls from her exes and I could also understand the sadness she felt because she did lose two people who were an important part of her life from childhood. I thought the book realistically portrayed the journey Sloane takes to overcome the pain and betrayal as well as where those relationships are left in the end. 
 Finn is a fun guy most of the time and helps Sloane break out of her funk. She teaches his little sister how to swim and as Sloane and Finn spend more and more time together she falls for him. Finn is not the only one who helps Sloane move past her heartache. She also has a friend in Mia and her family is there for her too. I liked how supportive her parents were although they seemed pretty liberal in their parenting. 
 I did think the secondary characters weren't as well developed and some seemed to just disappear from the story. I also wish the setting had been more detailed. There were a few uses of Hawaiian words here or there but beyond that the book could easily have been set in California or Florida and I wouldn't notice the difference. 
 I did like Summer of Sloane overall. I think readers looking for a pleasant escape this summer should give it a try. I would suggest this book to fans of Jessi Kirby, Leila Howland, Morgan Matson and other similar authors."
4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 This was an interesting read. Abigail was very likable and was a good way of introducing the reader to Jackaby's quirky life. This feels like the beginning of a nice paranormal-mystery-solving team. I just hope that Abigail learns how to fight sups so she won't be the damsel in distress in every volume."
2,"It seems that people who read this book break down into two groups - those who think the book was amazing, and those who really, really liked it. After reading half the book, though, I've decided to put it down and banish it to the dreary land of ""did not finish"", which is ruled by the powerful overlord known as ""King Meh."" Now I know I'm in the super-minority here of people who just didn't like this book so much, and I think all in all, it was the 'right' book to write, by that, I mean this book is a necessary contribution to literature, it's good to sort of bring to greater awareness the tragic destruction of the Wilhelm Gustloff. All these reasons make me reluctant to give it a lower star rating, but it won't even affect the book's rating, so I'm just going to be honest with this review. 
 There's a couple reasons I just couldn't finish the book, and they all sort of tie in together. First, without fail, all the chapters are about a page and a half, maybe two pages, two and a half at the most. While some would see that as fast-paced, short chapters alone do not make a book fast-paced. The reason is because what is actually happening for at least the first half of the book is pretty boring - they all sort of make their journey, pass security checkpoints, and... that's about it. 
 Next, the short chapters just become repetitive. There should be a mix of long, short and medium-length chapters. Have you ever ridden on a train? There's something about the constant whomp-a-whomp-a-whomp-a-whomp of the wheels clunking against the timbers that sooths you to sleep. The constant motion, the constant sound. It's like a Newton cradle or sounds of nature CD. It's sleep aid. That's good if you want to fall asleep, but terrible if you want to keep someone's attention. To keep a reader's attention, a book needs to break up the pacing. It can't be a constant whomp-a-whomp-a-whomp-a; you need pitfalls, hairpin turns, freefall, jarring halts, etc. While the book has some intrigue with each character, each character seems to have their own backstory and their own secret, by making every chapter two pages, the book just feels... tired. There's something satisfying about finishing a long chapter, just as there is with completing a long journey. But here, it's like clockwork. Page-and-a-half. Chapter. Page-and-a-half. Chapter. Page-and-a-half. Chapter. Whomp-a-whomp-a-whomp-a-whomp-a. Puts me to sleep. 
 As a result of the short chapters, I have problems feeling connected to the characters. I'm only with them for a couple paragraphs then boom, I'm off with someone else. It makes it prohibitive for a character to really begin to make an impression. It's kinda like the concept of speed dating. Sit down with someone. Hi, I'm Ariel. Someone else steps in. My name's Bill and I like the color blue. Someone else. I'm Eva and I work as a therapist. Back to Ariel, my dad worked at a golf course. Over to Bill. My wife left me two years ago. Meet Eva again. I like the mountains. Back to Ariel. And I think... wait, which one was Ariel again? Was she the one who liked blue? Was she a therapist or was that Bill? Granted, each time you meet them, you learn a new thing about their character, or their relationship with the others, or they take another step in their journey, but because it jumps around from character to character in such a short span, I just end up forgetting who everyone is and why they're special. I don't have time to really get to KNOW the characters, much less CARE for them. And that just defeats the purpose. The book has the makings of a great character-driven story with a diverse cast with unique storylines splendidly woven together.... BUT it's done wrong. Too short chapters. Whomp-a-whomp-a-whomp-a. 
 It's made worse, to me, because of how the characters refer to each other. The German. Took me several chapters to remember which of them was the German. The nurse. Took several chapters for me to remember which one was the nurse. The pregnant one. The blind one. And to top it off, the characters all refer to each other differently. To one, one is ""a knight"". There's also a ""shoe poet""? Halfway into the book and I have completely no idea who the shoe poet is, and whoever it is is only referred to by the one character. I literally do NOT know who the poet is. At what point would these characters finally say, ""My name is..."" To me, this is what ended up being the deal-breaker, referring to characters only as the poet or the knight. It just got old. That's good for the first chapter-and-a-half, but then the person should ******* introduce themselves. 
 So I'm glad the author has been able to write a book that so many people have loved, and I like that it brings some awareness to a forgotten tragedy, the single greatest human loss of life on a sinking ship. That's all commendable. But as a writer and a reader, the constantly short chapters, jumping around from character to character, not giving time to really get to know a character, it's just... not a captivating book to me. And it's really unfortunate to not like a book more purely because of the formatting than the actual storytelling. Like combine several chapters into one and I'd like it more. Of course I'm not saying that should be done. I'm just in the minority. Everyone else seems to love the book and have no problem with the pacing. But for me, it was a big issue. I can really justify any star rating for the book, from one to five stars, all make sense to me, but you ask me how I felt about the book, didn't like it, was okay, liked it, loved it, it was awesome, I'd say --- it was okay. That's two stars. Two stars."
4,"Pretty good middle book, a 4 star read. 
 I think this could have been a more compact read. There was a lot of to-ing and fro-ing, but I really felt like both writers were coming into their own this book. I have high expectations for the final book in the trilogy and hope there are more cameos there, like in this book. 
 I did like both Jubilee and Flynn but am very excited that the third book focuses on Sofia. I hope to find a copy soon!"
4,"Wow. That was insane. An insane, insane, ending. What a great writer - these characters really get under your skin. 
 I loved it. You should all read it :)"
4,OH MY GOD YOU CANT JUST LEAVE IT LIKE THAT WHAT THE HELL I NEED BOOK 3 RIGHT NOW
4,"3.75 stars. I have a thing for fairy tale retellings (and by ""a thing"" I mean two whole shelves dedicated to just retold fairy tales), so when I saw this one at the library, I snatched it up. 
 We all know the story of Cinderella, so I don't really need to outline the plot. It's Cinderella...but she (named Nicolette in this story) is an inventor/mechanic and makes her own happily ever after. AWESOME. I absolutely loved this take on the Cinderella story, I loved the capable-female-character angle, and I especially loved the ending. The writing wasn't amazing, but it wasn't awkward or purple prosey either...more effortless than anything else. It was easy to read without feeling overly simplistic. 
 I'd rate this book higher except for the big flaw that other reviewers mention...(view spoiler)[ there wasn't really a conflict or a climax. I think the author missed an opportunity for the stepmother and sisters to try to ruin things for Nicolette's happily ever after in order to create a crisis. That's the POINT of the Cinderella story...her wicked stepsisters ruin her gown, so then we have a crisis for the fairy godmother to come in and fix. Or the carriage turns back into a pumpkin at midnight, so Cinderella has to flee (which was alluded to in this book, but wasn't ever really a problem). Or, the prince is now hunting the countryside with one lone glass slipper, searching for a mystery woman, while the evil stepmother imprisons Cinderella in order to block the reunion. SOMETHING. I was waiting for the stepmother to step in and smash things up a bit at the end....but there wasn't so much as a torn gown. 
 Still, despite this, I finished the book feeling pretty satisfied. It wasn't until I had a chance to digest it a bit more that I realized that climax was missing. (hide spoiler)] 
 I'll be adding this one to my collection for sure."
4,I really don't like that Adam guy... SMH
2,"This ghost story is much more sad than scary. Each chapter is told through different characters and - never a good sign - I found myself constantly checking back to see who was narrating a particular section. Lauren Oliver writes great YA fiction, but this foray into adult fiction is just okay."
5,"Holy crap. 
 The Winter Long is a book of revelations. Secrets upon secrets upon secrets, teased apart until the truth (or part of it, anyway) is revealed. 
 It has become incredibly obvious that McGuire constructed Toby's world and her story very carefully; while the twists and turns of this book are unexpected (I did guess one, but that was mostly luck), they fit impeccably with the structure McGuire created. 
 And yet, while this book provides delicious resolution to several hanging storylines (all the way back to the first book!), it's clear there's more still to come. 
 Tragically, I have caught up to the current end-point of the series...and I'll have to wait to find out what that ""more"" is. Damn it."
1,"This is what I felt reading this book Honestly everyone in the book got on my nerves there was so much unnecessary drama when it didn't have to happen and the love the hero and heroine had for each other I did not believe it for one minute and when they finally got together it was in the last chapter so I couldn't even invest in them 
 Also the brother Lochlan What the hell is that dude on steroids or something every time he was mention the guy was screaming and getting mad he really needed a slap in the face"
1,"DNF @ 40% 
 I really just can't bring myself to continue. 
 This is my third Jenny Milchman novel and I'm pretty sure this will be my last. As with all her previous works I can see and understand what she was trying to do, but the whole thing was so terribly executed. 
 The characters are all so weird. Their motivations make no sense and their inner/outer struggles feel so fake. 
 And the writing was absolutely abominable. I swear my brain was about to start bleeding. 
 PRE-READING THOUGHTS: 
 Are we going back to Wedeskyull??? 
 Home of the worlds most random weirdos???"
5,*review to come*
4,"This book is one that I've been meaning to pick up forever. Glad that I finally did. The first hundred pages were a bit slow for me. It was interesting, but kind of vague. It introduced Eon slowly, letting you see where she was and what she was doing (pretending to be a boy) and lacked excitement. Once you get a bit further and she is immersed in the world of the court, things pick up drastically. 
 The characters in this were great. Eon with her struggles of identity and worth. Ryko and Lady Dela and their hidden talents and agendas. Rilla and Chart and their devotion. Lord Ido's twisted ideas about the dragon power. They were all fascinating. I'm really excited to read the next book."
4,"You would have thought I'd learn by now, but after each Immortal Guardians book I always tell myself, ""There is no way I could possibly love any couple more than XX and XX"". Dianne continues to prove me wrong, I truly fall in love with all of them. 
 Lisette and Zach's attraction started in a previous book so we knew their story was coming for a while. Both have been drawn to each other and things get hot and heavy pretty quickly in NIGHT UNBOUND. I enjoyed getting to know both of the characters more in depth. They really were great together, but I had no doubt they would be going in. 
 We get a surprisingly large amount of information about Seth in NIGHT UNBOUND. We also see a totally different side of him than we are used to. I really liked that side. He is more ""human"" in my eyes after seeing him interact 2-on-1 with Zach and Lisette. 
 I know I have mentioned this before, but I can't help but mention it again because it's a huge part of why I love this series so much. I absolutely LOVE that all of the characters from previous and future books are a big part of each book. It keeps the storyline connected and I learn more and more about them all as the series continues. Dianne you have to write faster, I'm going through withdraw already.

4,"This was a really interesting read: part mystery, part historical fiction, but also part traditional YA fantasy. 
 I wish I'd known before reading this book that almost all the court politics were historically accurate. The way the author wove history with her fantasy world--down to the conflict between old gods and new religion--was one of the highlights of this novel. 
 The characters were well developed and the obstacles they faced seemingly insurmountable. I loved the intrigue with characters like Sybella and Annith, who clearly have their own stories to tell. The romance between Duval and Ismae was so sweet and well done, gradually building throughout the story. 
 I only docked it a star because of Ismae, whose blind trust and naivety grated on me since I suspected early on who the French spy was. I wished she'd used her head more and formed her own opinions, especially given her backstory. Also, the court politics, while engaging, made this a slower paced novel than I would've liked. 
 Overall, an entertaining read and a fantastic debut. I'll check out the next book in the series, especially since it's from Sybella's point of view!"
3,"After her sister is brutally murdered, Mac Lane goes to Ireland to track down the killer and in the process discovers she can see faeries. In addition, there seems to be an impending war between the human race and that of the Fae. To survive she must team up with the inscrutable (this has to be romance novelists' favorite word to describe male protagonists) Jericho Barrons. This was entertaining and kept me on my toes, even with all the trite description and over-used characterizations. I disliked some parts of Mac-I'm a blonde and like to wear pink and it's okay that I don't give a crap about anybody else in the world-but really she was opinionated and strong, and not a wilting flower like so many other female characters. Overall a fun read, even though not totally compelling. 
 On a side note-this is the 2nd book I've read on my Nook and I think that had something to do with me finishing it. I have a habit of flipping ahead in a romance novel if I'm getting fed up with the story, but couldn't really do that this time!"
3,"For a full and edited review go to Blame it on the Books 
 ""Quint, my boy, there isn't a problem so big a man can't solve it with a piece of you mama's sweet cherry pie in one hand and a fishing rod in the other."" 
 Apple pie and romance? You can count me in. 
 I was immediately turned off by the cover, it just seemed tacky but the book was above average. It seemed predictable at first but after the first 2 chapters I wasn't entirely sure what would end up happening. 
 Quinn just lost his father 
 ""A widow maker, the heart specialist called it. Fine one minute, gone the next"" 
 Instead of leaning on his wife (Callee) and remaining family he bailed and went fishing. His marriage was already going under because he barely spent time with Callee or paid attention to her. We get too see his point of view but I just wish we could have seen more rawness and emotion from him. Maybe he got all those feelings out when he went fishing but It would have been great too see some of it, instead of having to hear how ""Kissable her lips were"". 
 Callee lost her mother when she was young and now that she's lost the closest thing to a father she's ever had. When she tries to be there for her husband he tells her they should get a divorce and seeing no other option she ends up having to agree. 
 ""Telling your friends that your husband would rather fish than celebrate your wedding anniversary together was embarrassing. Telling your friends that your husband didn't want you anymore... that was embarrassing."" 
 Even though she didn't want too she packed up her things and was all set for Seattle, until the unexpected happens. 
 That's when things start to get tricky. Now Quinn and Callee, along with Quinn's former employee Andrea, have to try to run a pie bakery when they 
 A) Have no experience running any restaurant 
 B) Cannot bake a pie... publicly 
 The romance was swoony and perfect. The whole situation felt very real and relatable, except you know we don't all find love with hunky men at first sight. Otherwise, it felt natural, I also loved that the whole book they're talking about a specific pie recipe and at the end it has the actual recipe! Now I'm not much of a baker but I really want to give it a try. This was definitely a great summer read, just make sure you have pie or cake near you because you'll definitely be craving one!"
0,"This might be the fastest I've ever abandoned a book. I got to the line ""on the other end of the call was atlas, her brother-- and the reason she never wanted to kiss anyone else"" at the end of the first chapter and just noped right out of there!"
5,"I have never read anything like this before. Spectacular, epic! It's so fast paced, a constant smack of theology and mythology and a culture so unknown to me weaved pretty expertly with technology and magic. Alif has a solid arc I really enjoyed reading, but my favorite character was definitely Vikram :) :("
5,"Simply awesome... by the way I hate fantasy fiction but thanks to my bro, I will start reading some more of them."
5,New Adult Fantasy. I never knew I needed this genre in my life until now. I love this book. I freaking love it. More thoughts later.
5,I am constantly amazed at how much story this woman can fit into one book! It's like trying to put together a 1000 piece puzzle without looking at the picture on the box. I can't wait for the next book to come out!!
4,"I think 4.5 stars 
 Really wonderful book-fast paced and well executed. Full review soon"
5,tha book was awesome... i truely enjoyed reading it.... :)
5,"It took me a stupid amount of time to get around to reading this. Spicy, fun, beauty and the beast story."
2,"Ugh, I just lost my whole review!!! 
 Anyway... grrr... I love Tessa Bailey, but this reads like Tessa Bailey aka 8th grade. Well, with the caveat that no 8th grader would have the sexy talk going on here. 
 Continuing with my walk on the cynical side, what we have here is a pity-party-thinks-he's-a bad-guy hero Vaughn who is yet another hero who must do the cruel to be kind routine to his love of his life high school sweetheart. He leaves her cold, but not before sweet River pulls out the stops, and they have cataclysmic sex one last time. I need to mention that Tessa Bailey raises the stakes to the third degree in terms of sexy talk. That's not all. Vaughn rarely calls River by her name. No. No. No. He calls her, ""doll"" all the blasted time. Straight out of youse Guys and Dolls. 
 Four years later, Vaughn receives a letter that he has a three year old daughter. He rushes to his old town where doll hardly gives him a hard time. They have sex almost instantly, and while sexy with sexy talk, the sex seems a little painful to me. 
 Vaughn vacillates between wanting to be there and feeling he should leave as he is soooo baaaaadddd, soooo unworthy. Get over it dude. Doll is an adoring heroine, but she's not stupid. They really come across just as what they are: high school sweethearts still in love. 
 Angst ensues, and although Vaughn is a medaled soldier, neither he nor doll's manipulative father feels he measures up or will ever measure up. Vaughn gets a grip, FINALLY, but I stopped caring before then. Poor doll, she's going to have her hands full with this one. Yes, he adores the ground she walks on, but it feels he will always have one foot out the door because he doesn't measure up. He can't connect except sexually, and even he realizes that needs to change. 
 Doll's dad is a piece of work who helped manipulate V out of town for a variety of selfish reasons. 
 Dropped threads as in what happened with the guy that notified him about his child, why did the h's mother not do anything. 
 Fun secondary characters in Duke, Duke's four crazy sisters, the new and angsty owner of the plant, and the plot moppet. 
 I will still read TB. She writes awesome, besotted alpha heroes. Try the following: Staking His Claim, and Protecting What's His. 
 If you want a quintessential high school to second chance love with a good girl and a bad boy, try Ride Steady"
0,"Unfortunately, I couldn't make it through the audiobook. I did not realize this was science fiction/dystopian; is on route I'm not interested in reading at this time. I might consider reading it in the future but I certainly won't be listening to the audiobook. The female narrator's voice was SOOOO nasally! That was all I heard, unable to focus on the story. Because I did not read the entire book, I will not post a star rating."
5,I....that....yeah...that was awesome.
4,"Sometimes Jeff Kinney makes me nervous. I think he's giving away all adult secrets - which makes for a hilarious book. But if the kids ever catch on, I think there'll be an uprising. 
 The book is full of those awkward moments where the readers have inside information to the thought process of adults... (view spoiler)[take good ol' St. Nick for instance. Jeff does a nice job with this given the age of some of his readers... He can't out the jolly old elf, but there's some subtlety and irony in the fact that Santa gave the town bully a dirt bike. ... another instance is when the mom seriously: (view spoiler)[skips waiting in line to have his graphic novel signed (hide spoiler)] Both of these cases involve parents deliberately lying to their children. Do we want our kids knowing we're ok with this? Not that I am, mind you... (hide spoiler)] It just seems that he's showing a little bit too much of the adult hand sometimes. 
 At any rate, I loved the book. This series is definitely top notch. I found myself thinking, ""...yeah, no kidding. I could see myself doing that as a kid... heck... I could see myself doing that as an adult."""
4,"Oh Reyes! Don't be mad! She loves you!!! 
 I love this series. You don't even have to be a lover of paranormal books to get Charley and the gang. For the humor alone in this series people should pick up a copy the books. Any woman who names her breast (Danger and Will Robinson) and her ovaries (Beam-Me-Up and Scotty) is alright in my book. 
 Second Grave on the Left picks up about a week after First Grave on the Right ended. Reyes is missing (after disappearing from the hospital the day they were to pull the plug) and Charley wonders where he could be. Unfortunately, she doesn't have time to worry about all this because her best friend and secretary, Cookie, burst into her apartment in the middle of the night needing Charley to help locate her missing friend, Mimi. 
 So off our fearless PI / Grim Reaper goes to help Cookie. Along the way, Charley discovers there's a dead body in the trunk of Cookie's new car (which she promptly freaks out about), she's being tailed by the Albuquerque PD who think Reyes will be stopping by, and ""FBI"" agents stopping by for a chat and one of her dad's old collar's out for revenge. 
 Through all this is Charley's struggle with what Reyes plans on doing to stop the Apocalypse from happening. Charley can't see living the rest of her life without Reyes there, since he's always been with her, but he's hell bent on stopping his father from using him. 
 In the end, Charley solves the case of the missing Mimi and what led her to run away (she managed to nab the bad guys after suffering a serious beat down. You go, Charley!!), clears the air with her family and makes a decision she's positive Reyes will hate her for but one that she can live with. 
 I CANNOT wait for the next book to come out. February can't come fast enough!

3,"Disclaimer: I received this book for free through a giveaway on Twitter. I don't think it affected my review. 
 Zeroboxer tells the tale of Carr Luka, an eager young athlete in the new sport of Zeroboxing... a kind of mixed martial arts match in the zero-gravity environment of a space station. He works his way up the ranks and becomes a rising star, but it's not just his opponents he has to worry about. He's got secrets, some that happened years ago and he didn't even know about, but which might threaten his career... or even his life. 
 Obviously this is a mix between a ""boxer seeking the championship belt"" type story, and a science fiction. I should point out up front that I may be predisposed against this type of book. I generally don't watch sports at all, and, in particular, I have, if possible, even less interest in the sports that involve two people fighting. So in particular I'm not the best person to judge the sports-side of things. 
 I will note that there are a lot of familiar tropes that even someone like me who doesn't have a particular interest in the genre can pick out. The friend turned rival, the crusty mentor/coach who is hard on the fighter but deep down cares, the inspiring love interest, the eager young fan who never gives up hope, the point where the character has to make a choice between doing something unethical or having some kind of negative consequence. You might call them cliches but I think that would be a little unfair, particularly when it's a hybrid story like this one, the familiar tropes help anchor the ""sports"" part of the plot and let you add the sci-fi elements. 
 The sci-fi elements are, honestly, decent, but nothing that really blew me away. I might have raised an eyebrow at the apparent casualness of a trip to Mars, but otherwise the science seemed solid, serving the story and adding some texture to the world, and raising a few questions. I was certainly more interested in this part of things than the sports side, and it had a it more depth than I was expecting. 
 The intersection of the two sides comes most strongly in the sport of Zeroboxing itself, and here I think the book shines most. The sport is believable and told in an engaging way, probably even exciting to the type of person who's excited about sports. The author did seem to have put a good deal of thought into how it worked at least, and the terminology surrounding it (even when adapted from boxing lingo) sounded believable. 
 I've seen the book marketed as YA, and although I think it's suitable to that audience, I also feel the label does a bit of a disservice to the book by suggesting that it's the type of thing that's mostly of interest to teens. Aside from the main character starting at a typical-YA age of seventeen, it doesn't tackle teen issues or harp on melodramatic love triangles, it's just a fairly straightforward rising star sports story with some reasonably well-done SF elements, and anyone who particularly likes both sports and SF, regardless of age, could probably get a lot out of the book. If you only really like one, it depends a lot more on how much enthusiasm you can drum up for the other part. 
 The story's a fairly brisk read, and the plot does what it needs to do but on many levels, just by the nature of the genre, it's predictable: if the main character has to win a fight to move on to the next stage, he obviously wins. The ending also fell a little flatter than I'd hoped, not the fight intself but more particularly with the protagonist's non-fight problem, which seemed to sort of fizzle. Still, overall, I think it's a decent book, and probably to people who's tastes run more towards boxing in general, it might even be a very good book. For me, I'd put it in the low three range, I enjoyed it, wasn't ever bored even in the action-heavy parts, but I doubt I'd read it again or follow on to a potential sequel, though I might give the author a try on another work."
5,"Kerrigan Byrne tricks us with deceptively simple titles for such complex and tormented heroes. Because The Highwayman, The Hunter, and now, The Highlander, are anything but what these simple labels would imply. For me, Kerrigan Byrne is a throwback author - her writing is a throwback to the 70s-90s when historical romances contained darker elements, more action, and complicated characters and plots. I heart her so much and, with this series, she has cemented herself onto my favorite authors list. Plus - she's super nice! I got to fangirl over Kerrigan a little at RT this year and I can't wait to stalk her down again at another signing. 
 In this third installment of the Victorian Rebels series, our heroine is almost as tormented as our hero. Philomena St. Vincent, Viscountess Benchley had a loving childhood with her widowed father. Before his death and wanting Mena taken care of, he arranges her marriage to the Viscount Benchley from the neighboring St. Vincent family, who appeared charming on the surface. However Mena quickly finds herself in an abusive and humiliating marriage with the very sadistic and cruel St. Vincent family. Once the family has run through Mena's money and have no further use for her, they have her declared mad and committed to the Belle Glen Asylum, a brutal institution with a perverse doctor, a fiendish orderly, and cruel nurses. Trust me when I say that Mena's time in the asylum was very hard to read - I think I was cringing the whole time and hoping it wouldn't go into too great of detail. This all served to get me emotionally invested in Mena's story and, of course, get your first ugly cry out of the way. Luckily Mena made powerful friends in The Hunter, and so she is rescued from Belle Glen by Dorian Blackwell and Christopher Argent. As a fugitive from her husband and the crown (for being deemed insane), Dorian and Farah send Mena to the Highlands disguised as a governess, Philomena Lockhart. 
 Liam MacKenzie, Lieutenant Colonel, Marquess of Ravencroft is known as the Demon Highlander for his berserker-like battle rage. Liam went off to war fully expecting to never return. He thought that would be better for everyone as he truly believes he has a demon inside him. Growing up with a monstrous father really did a number on Liam. After Dorian and Christopher, I didn't think Liam could beat them in the tormented-life stakes... but man, his story was just as heart-wrenching. The imagery Byrne uses to describe Liam, his tormented past and present, his persona, and even his physical characteristics really drew a picture of him in my mind and got me so wrapped up in his character that I didn't want to let go. Liam is a violent man, but a good man. He is tormented by thoughts that he will turn into his father, and this blinds him to his true nature. He loves his children. He cares for his people, his land and his legacy. He is the perfect protector for the battered and abused Mena. 
 The relationship between Liam and Mena is touch and go. She obviously is battling more recent demons, jumping at shadows and flinching in the face of anger. Both Mena and Liam have secrets they are reluctant to share... Mena's marriage being the best secret of all. But the couple has an undeniable chemistry. Liam was Mena's salvation, and she was his redemption in turn. 
 I loved some of the landscape/setting and costume descriptions. But the detail Byrne put into the Samhain customs and traditions was fascinating. Secondary characters were fabulous as well. Liam's children were likable and added an extra element to the story. The relationship Liam wanted with his children helped humanize him, and allowed Mena to exercise her mothering instinct. Jani, Liam's Indian valet added his own sweetness and interesting insight and heartbreak to the story. But I don't know how to feel about Gavin Gavin St. James, Earl of Thorne. To be his brother, Gavin treated Liam horribly. After the events that occurred in the prologue, and all the beatings Liam took for Gavin, I couldn't countenance the bitterness and betrayal heaped on Liam by the Earl. But Gavin also had a fun and playful personality with everyone else... so it was only Liam that suffered his prickly side. 
 I am so looking forward to the next book featuring Colin Talmage, Duke of Trenwyth, who helped disband the East India Company with Liam. I can't believe we have to wait until February 2017 though! That seems forever away!

4,"3.5 A frustrating, but intriguing read. Chaon is a one of a kind thriller writer, and although this holds one interest all the way through, the format and need to organize/compartmentalize what is going on takes quite a bit of effort. Thanks to Netgalley for the ARC"
5,"I'M GOING TO COME BACK TO THIS. I'M TOO TIRED TO WRITE A REVIEW ATM. 
 REST ASSURED, THIS BOOK IS WORTH YOUR WHILE. 
 OKAY, BRB. :D"
4,"Mixed feelings about the ending. 
 And Katsa's anti-marriage thing kind of hits you over the head. (Even when Po tells her that she'd still be free to do what she what she wants if she marries him, she knows her freedom would never be her own, it would always be his to give or withhold. What the heck? She's a Graceling, she killed a man when she was eight, and she's not going to pump out babies for anyone. Clearly she doesn't care about rules or expectations. Now, if she married him and took control of her own freedom anyway, that would be empowering.) As it is, it's like, Well since a woman can't be a man's equal, the only way to be your own person is to never have a husband. 
 Other than that: Well written. Compelling plot. Loved the world Cashore created, and the concept of Graces."
5,Quite possibly the best book I will read this year. Superb. Moxie girls fight back!
5,"I love the idea of the vigilante type of lead character with Day. and the character development that June has is amazing. I love how calculated she was with every single move, even when she was blindly believing things she would carefully analyze everyone. this book was really really good. June had the best character evolution in one book that I've seen in a while. I'm looking forward to seeing how they both evolve in the next book."
4,4.5 Amazing Stars for one hell of an author
4,"I received a free copy of this book thanks to Netgalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review, this has in no way impacted on my reivew. 
 so i've taken some time to think about this and i'm going to lower my initial rating down to four stars, i feel like the shock factor changed my perception slightly and yeah. sorry about that but i still loved this book a lot. 
 Basically: This book follows four separate perspectives for an interwoven narrative following the retreat of German troops at the end of the second world war. 
 In Depth: I've wanted to read a Ruta Sepetys book for sometime now, I keep hearing the most amazing things about her books. So when this novel came up on netgalley I requested it never thinking I would be approved, but I was. This was honestly such an exciting moment for me and it made me smile. A lot. So I read it, quite quickly for me and I kind of enjoyed it, I can definitely see the appeal for readers but I'm not sure I fully connected to the characters. 
 The Story: The book begins with four separate POVs that begin to connect up as the story unfolds, the first three characters meet relatively quickly and there development happens rapidly. The fourth character is the last to meet the others and potentially a huge part of the reason I didn't connect with this book the way I hoped I would. 
 The first three characters are travelling towards the ships that will take them from where they are in Poland to Germany, where they hope they will be safe from the advancing Russian forces. As they are introduced they interact with a larger group and the perils of their journey are widely explored. This was easily the most engaging part of the story for me, favourite isn't the right word here, the sights seen are distressing and accurate (in my knowledge) portrayals of the horror's committed during this period. There's something harrowing and gripping about this book and the past that it shows. There's no doubting this. 
 The fourth and final POV is a German solider aboard the boats that are evacuating the 'desirables' back to Germany. 
 The Characters: This was the area of the book I felt was weakest, there were (for me at least) too many characters and not enough time to get to know them. The format that the characters were introduced, each with some kind of mystery felt a little complicated. Whilst I appreciated the way this was done, to help drive the story forward for me it didn't add anything and actually cost the story slightly. 
 The drive for the characters was hidden and only revealed later, which normally works well but with this for four different characters over a relatively short book I didn't feel that it worked as well as in some other books that I've read. This also made them hard (for me) to connect with, I wasn't sure who they were so I didn't feel as emotional a pull as I might have otherwise felt. 
 (view spoiler)[Also I felt that for me a major downside of this novel was Werner, his character felt like a cardboard cut out. He didn't feel like a true character. I think he was meant to be mentally ill, but the thing was he was never explored enough to make an informed decision over, his POV chapters were always short and often didn't make full sense. I felt like his character could have been left out entirely, or just better handled. (hide spoiler)] 
 My Thoughts: I would recommend this book (in fact I already have to a family member who I thought would enjoy a fiction version of a factual event) and I think the most emotional part of this story for me was (view spoiler)[that death in the ice, i cried lbr (hide spoiler)] and the fact that it was based on true events. That that many people really did die. Will I be reading more of Ruta Sepetys, I think I will. They're on my library wish list (and at some point I will read them) but they're not at the top of my MUST-CHECK-OUT-NOW pile. This is a good book that for me just falls short of being an excellent book."
4,"*4.5* Loved this one. It had all the elements for a second-chance contemporary romance. The writing was engaging and kept me reading straight through. Both Emma and Cassidy were likable characters you can't help but root for their HEA. Both of them were at fault with what tore them apart although I felt Cassidy should have manned up and fought for Emma more, but I can chalk it up to a youthful mistake. I especially liked flashes of jealousy coming from both them, especially Cassidy. That's one thing I really love from this type of trope. Great cast of characters and I can't wait to read more from this author. Seeing that this is my first Lauren Layne, I have a lot to look forward to."
4,"The first time I tried reading this book, I was annoyed by the tone of the letters. Because I want to see the movie, I picked it up again. This time, I made myself get through the first few pages, and then I was completely hooked, and read nearly all of it on the train (and at a restaurant while I was waiting for my take-out, and at a light waiting for the crosswalk signal. it's that good). 
 It's sad, but I understand now why so many of my teen readers think this is the best book ever. It's probably a bit dated, having taken place 20 years ago, but unfortunately it's many dark themes are timeless."
4,"Book blurb: A brutal triple murder in a remote farming community in northwestern Scotland in 1869 leads to the arrest of a young man by the name of Roderick Macrae. There's no question that Macrae is guilty, but the police and courts must uncover what drove him to murder the local village constable. 
 I'm not really a reader of crime fiction, so I wasn't sure what to expect when I started this one, but I found myself quickly engrossed in this crime drama. Unlike your typical crime story, the question is not who dunnit, or even why, but an exploration of the societal, cultural, and religious backdrop of the community where this crime occurs. 
 The story unfolds via documents ""discovered"" by the author and include the accused's memoir, trial transcripts, and newspaper reports. The story starts with police statements taken from people in the Culdie, who give conflicting impressions of the accused, so what's the truth? As the story unfolds, I found myself getting enraged, and thinking that certain people might indeed be better off dead. Then we get to trial, and certain facts shed a different light on things. I really enjoyed the themes this story explored, especially the look at class structures in Scotland, circa 1869. It really is quite well done, and I ripped through it in a couple of days. 
 I listened to the audiobook, which is superbly narrated by Antony Ferguson. His accent and performance perfectly set the mood for this dark tale."
4,"I felt the last chapter - epilogue was rushed a lot, besides that I liked the book."
4,"I don't know what exactly I was expecting, but it wasn't THAT. I decided to pick Half Bad because everyone on Goodreads and BookTube seemed to be talking about Half Wild, so I thought I might as well try the first book of the series to see if I liked it. And really, I did. 
 I was quite confused at the beginning, mostly because of the writing style and the fact that I had no idea where this was going, but the second I got to the second part, I was hooked. I rarely read about male characters, because I seem to choose mostly YA books with female main characters. However, I liked this experience. I couldn't really relate to Nathan, but I understood him more than I ever thought I could. There were parts that were painful to read, because I'm not really a fan of fights and blood and torture, but I got over them. 
 I loved the fact that this is a fast-paced book. Even if it's more of a fantasy book, I felt like I was reading a thriller, a dystopian book or something like that. This world felt real to me, with its witches and Gifts and stuff, up until there is a secret way to travel that Nathan finds. This felt out of place to me, but it might only be because everything else felt normal to me. I absolutely loved the cage scenes, because I liked Nathan's strength and Celia's character. To be honest, I would probably not have minded if there had been a whole book about his life there. 
 I liked a lot of the characters, but I didn't feel like there was much to them, except for Nathan. In fact, while Arran was nice and loved his brother dearly, I didn't find anything else about him that made him special, human. Since he isn't a huge part of the story, it was fine, but I realized that this was also the case for a couple other characters, such as Annalise, sometimes. 
 I definitely want to continue reading this series, because while it has its downsides, they are many and I really enjoyed this read. I can't wait to find out more about the story!"
5,"Very cute story about a little boy whose crayons each write him a letter complaining about their treatment. Not too detailed, with little quips about the other crayons here and there. Fun picture book!"

3,"A bit of a departure for Lee Child's Jack Reacher series, but not in a bad way. Child pulls back the reins in ""Running Blind"", with less shoot-'em-up action and more traditional murder mystery deduction, proving that Reacher can be just as much brain as he can braun. In this one, the fourth Reacher novel, Reacher is picked up by the FBI as a ""person of interest"" in a serial murder case. Someone is killing women across the country in a bizarre way, and Reacher happens to be the main connection: he knew all of them in either a personal or professional manner. The killer somehow enters the homes of these women without a struggle. The woman are found dead in the tub full of military-green paint, with no apparent cause of death. The killer also leaves no evidence at all: no fingerprints, DNA, fibers. It has the FBI stumped, and, more importantly, it has Reacher pissed off. With the help of a perky young agent, Reacher struggles to find the answers before anymore women are murdered, but he unfortunately has to work against the FBI agents in charge, who apparently all have their own political and personal agendas. Although not as gung-ho and action-laden as the previous novels, ""Running Blind"" is just as suspenseful and intriguing. Child builds up the tension by creating a fascinating murder mystery plot. Arguably, the murderer and the motive may be fairly detectable early on, if you are one of those careful mystery readers, but it's still an excellent thriller."
4,I have yet to read a bad book by this man. They're all amazing and they keep getting better as he gets further in his writing career.
5,"The foreshadowing, possible injustices, questionable decisions, and sadness in this book could make it a tough read for a lot of kids. I don't think my own 5th-graders could handle it. I barely could handle it. 
 But the writing is amazing. It's one of the rare books where I wished I had post-it notes to mark all of the passages and phrases that affected me. I even got actual goosebumps on my legs at one point."
5,"I've just read books 1-9 in the In Death series and all I can think about is that nobody ever brushes their teeth in these books. 
 Edit: Eve finally got around to brushing her teeth in book 16."

 Will everyone make it out of this okay? Or will hell's hounds have their way? 
 From start to finish I was enthralled. Interested and eager to know what happens next! Hanging on every word! 
 I am so eager to read book two! 
 Thanks Brandy Nacole for sharing this story with all of us! My imagination is very happy! ;) 
 (view spoiler)[text> 
 When I found out the reason that Kayson fell I was practically dumbfounded! I was hoping seriously that Kayson and Sabrina would be together. But really unsure if they will ever get the chance. Briston has a thing for Emma but I wasn't sure about his reaction to Sabrina. 
 Then there are the vague details surrounding Emma's brother, Tate. 
 But I am so happy for Emma and Briston at their newfound mutual feelings. There is also no doubt in my mind that Kayson would move heaven and earth for Sabrina. 
 The situation worsens when Emma's day at work turns into hearing her circle of friends recount their hike and the sword that they found. But overheard by a hell hound lurking in the diner, Emma is frantically trying to formulate a plan to get the sword she is sure was left behind by her heavenly boarder. Her stubborn bestie Braylee has the sword hidden and is reluctant to agree to even showing it to Emma and Briston. 
 With the sword now in Emma's custody thanks to Sabrina's coercion, they are ready to set out on their distraction plan. Sabrina goes out as a scout while they wait for her return and the all clear to start on their mission. 
 Emma and Briston have a little time on their hands and he doesn't miss his opportunity. Loves first kiss is always so sweet. It brings Emma's love for Briston front and center. With that out of the way they are anxious for Sabrina's return. What could be taking her so long? 
 What happens next has them all in a fight for their lives both mortal and immortal. After the battle Emma's friends have come to learn of all that Emma has been dealing with. Briston is injured in the fight but he will be okay. They now have to stick together since Falon and Emery returned to hell after the grand entrance of Stille and the other fallen but Falon will be back to finish what he started. 
 While they don't necessarily agree with Kayson they cannot leave him and the mortals unprotected. And the final kicker is the return of mysterious Tate. Will he complicate things or reveal what is really going on. And what will happen to Sabrina?? As Lucifer scolds Falon for his failures he tells him to assemble All of the hounds. I will be anxiously awaiting the next book indeed! 
 You will be on pins and needles at the ending of this book! (hide spoiler)]"
4,"For the whole first part of the novel I struggled with the main character, but once she actually got to the resort I flew through this. Guilty pleasure 100%. 
 Why don't resorts like this actually exist?"
3,"I would give this a solid 3.5 stars. It was cute and easy to read. I didn't love the way it ended. Without spoiling anything, I think it was a little cheap and convenient on the part of the author."
3,"This was an entertaining, if sometimes off-putting, read. On the whole, I enjoyed this very much. The author has a witty turn of phrase and subtle sense of humor. But it did take a while to warm up to the hero, Ned. Initially, I found myself comparing him to a small puppy - loud, boastful, and selfish with a ""look at me!"" attitude. NOT attractive characteristics for someone meant to play the hero's role. But this initial impression paved the way for a subtle shifting and transformation into a character worthy of the title ""hero."" Ned's character arc was a satisfying change from the obnoxious puppy seen in the beginning of the story. All thanks to one woman - the heroine, Phoebe Baker. 
 Phoebe is a woman of sharp intelligence and quiet dignity. After her father's death, she was forced to accept a position as a governess - not quite family, not quite servant - and it is this very change in circumstances that molds her into the strong, steadfast woman we get to see in this story. 
 The wager between Ned and his secretary, Turner, is entertaining, if slightly distasteful in practical execution. Get a woman to fall in love with you in two weeks without using the benefit of your title or wealth. There were many times I sat shocked at the thoughts and words coming from Ned and Turner about each other. These men are supposed to be friends and yet this wager turned them into monsters when it came to their ""friendly"" interactions. Yet by the end, both men learned something from the wager and grew into better characters. 
 The romance does take a while to get started, but I think had it begun any sooner, it would have felt rushed or disingenuous. Given the circumstances, I think the romance was more realistic and well-paced, but did rush towards the end.

4,"4.5 Stars! City of Bones is one of those books you just have to be in the right mood to like it. For YEARS, I wasn't ready to restart the series and finally close it with the last book, but a few days ago, I suddenly was. 
 And you know what, I don't care about the plot holes, about unrealistic developments or problematic things right now. I am aware they exist, thank you very much, but right now all I wanted is to dive into this world and that's exactly what this book did for me. It was the escape I needed and got me excited to read the rest of the series immediately, and right now I'm not asking for more. 
 Also, it's SO much better in English. I can't believe how much we've missed out on with the translations! Although on the other hand, this atmosphere is just extremely difficult to transport into another language because it's so deeply rooted in culture, which is also what makes it so genius and interesting to read. Lit student nerd out!"
5,"Another 5 star read from Kristen Ashley. I love her books, angsty, bittersweet storyline and characters both. I wasn't sure I'd like this series since it had more suspense than her other books, but she gripped me with this storyline and the characters are of course classic Ashley...mature, lost/drifting, strong alpha males. *sigh* Perfect!"
5,"I was really pleasantly surprised by this book. I've been hearing a lot about it and on my quest to read more UKYA (since it's where I'm from and I want to support the UKYA scene) I decided to pick it up. I am so happy that I did as it is one of those stories that I completely devoured. 
 David is fourteen years old and has known since he was a child that he is really a female stuck inside a male body. His two best friends are the only ones to know and he is struggling to find the right way to tell his parents. He has already been branded the ""freak show"" at school and certainly doesn't want his life to become even more difficult. But he knows that he needs to become who he really is. 
 Leo is the new kid school and his attempt to stay as invisible as possible fails when he steps in and stands up for David in a fight. David is insistent in becoming friends with him but Leo moved schools for a reason and David is set to become the only person to know the real truth of why. 
 The characters in this book are wonderful. There are alternating points of view from David and Leo and each had a very distinct voice. Both of their stories are very moving in their own way and have the right balance of sensitivity, development and humour. 
 One of the things I liked most about this story is that it's not just about being transgender. It tackles diversity, the class system, bullying, becoming a teenager and turbulent family relationships. Each theme is so beautifully written and with just the right amount of humour that you can be in tears one minute whilst laughing the next. 
 The Art of Being Normal is an emotional and realistic coming-of-age story which challenges the idea of what being ""normal"" actually means. I highly recommend it."
3,"Rating: 3.5 Stars 
 From the first moment we met parasol-wielding Eleanor in Something Strange and Deadly, I've been a fan of this series. While A Darkness Strange and Lovely clearly suffered from Middle Book Syndrome, Strange and Ever After most definitely did not. Out of all the conclusions I've read lately, this installment feels the most conclusive. Dennard not only notches up the pace of this final novel, but she also heightens the risk and danger. As such, Strange and Ever After is a non-stop, page-flipping adventure, incorporating elements from the previous two novels into an explosive finale that may not necessarily satisfy, but definitely will not be forgotten. 
 Strange and Ever After starts out in Paris, quickly moves to Marseille, and finally ends up in Egypt. When the novel opens, Allison has just arrived from Philadelphia, bearing the unfortunate news that Eleanor's mother has passed away. Stuck on Daniel's hot-air balloon with nothing but her grief, worry for her best friend Jie, and anger at Marcus, Eleanor slowly begins pushing everyone away. Yet, there is hardly time to dwell on emotions for Marcus is becoming more and more powerful by the minute and if Eleanor ever wants the hope of a normal life, she will have to stop him...before he stops her. 
 While Eleanor's motives and personality in A Darkness Strange and Lovely remained obscure and changed, in Strange and Ever After I was finally able to understand her agency. Eleanor's relationships don't start out in a very strong place and, more often than not, she is readily testy. Not only has Eleanor lost the trust of Ollie, her demon, but her relationship with Daniel is fragile and uncertain for he dislikes her abilities as a necromancer. With Allison on board, Eleanor's situation is no easier and her heart, mind, and emotions pull her in different directions. One of the best aspects of this novel, though, lies in the fact that Eleanor grows to open up to those around her and carry meaningful conversations with them. While she still struggles to control her abilities, she is determined not to succumb to darkness and maintain the relationships she shares with others - which she does. 
 While Eleanor and Daniel's romance truly took off in this installment, with plenty of swoon-worthy moments and touching dialogues, the relationship at the forefront was that between Ollie and Eleanor. I couldn't get a grasp Ollie's character in A Darkness Strange and Lovely as I was unsure whether or not to trust him. Even in this installment, he is exasperating, pushing Eleanor to her breaking point at times. But as we grow to understand Ollie, to see life from his perspective, the friendship between him and Eleanor becomes ever-stronger. I grew to love his character by the end and, in some ways; he even eclipses Daniel (but never in my heart). 
 With such a large host of characters and emotional ties, Strange and Ever After never falters in its plot. The Spirit Hunters are constantly on the move, uncovering pieces of information about Marcus and the Old Man in a timely fashion. Moreover, I really enjoyed the change of setting from one novel to the next. Dennard has mastered the art of world-building and the richness of the reality she has created, as well as the mythological references that cropped up, made this story such a delight. Even the final showdown with Marcus is brilliantly written, proving that every victory has its sacrifices. We've seen Eleanor up against Marcus before and though she is stronger, he is still a formidable opponent. It is only with the help of others that she is truly able to put an end to his evil once and for all. 
 Where this story faltered for me, though, is in the unexpected death of a main character. I anticipate and look forward to character deaths in a concluding novel because of the emotional upheaval they bring. With this death, though, I felt blindsided and surprised. It's a death I struggled to rationalize and cope with because it was so unfair and while I have qualms about it - particularly regarding its necessity and the fact that it represents that the character in question never saw themselves as worthwhile - it also makes for a bittersweet, albeit surprising, conclusion. I'm not sure how I expected this series to end, but I'm glad it's done. Dennard's debut trilogy has had its ups and downs and while I wouldn't recommend against it, I'm not sure I'd shove it upon a friend either. Nevertheless, I look forward to whatever Dennard has up her sleeve next. I may harbor mixed feelings towards this series as a whole, but towards her writing? None at all."
5,"Aggggghhhhh 
 Sparks got me with this one. This will likely be my one and only ever Nicholas Sparks book. It's not that I didn't like it, because I did, but this is not my kind of book and the fact that I liked it so much scares me. It was just so over the top cute and cuddly romantic (which I am NONE of these things), but I loved it. 
 If you like this kind of book it may be your Holy Grail, and even if you don't like this type of book, who knows, you might enjoy it anyway."

5,"I thought this book was great! It's my third book about an MMA fighter in a month. Reid, the MMA fighter, is injured and his regular sports med guy has a family emergency. This sends him unwittingly to a physical therapist that happens to be an old friend, Lucie. He wants her to work on him full time, so that he can be back in the ring in two months. Impossible! She has patients that count on her. But he sweetens the pot by offering to give her lessons to make her dream man Dr. Dingleberry fall at her feet. It's an offer she can't refuse. He helps her subtlety helps her improve her look, accentuating the positive. She sees herself as a Plain Jane. The lessons gradually escalate to kissing and touching, then they go for the trial run. Their chemistry is wonderful! Sexually nd otherwise. All of these lessons are under the guise of landing the surgeon she's been half in love with for years. The journey is fun and sexy and the ending is pure romance. This is a first offering from a new author. Can't wait to read more of her books. 
 The thing I loved about this book was that Reid was an Alpha Renaissance Man! He wasn't afraid to look good, or be able to cook, but he was still the bad boy with the tats and almost Mohawk hairstyle that can kick your ass all over the mat and pick you up and fuck you where he stands!"
3,"3.5 Stars! 
 Iris had no choice but to ask her half brother, Sonny, for help, cause she was broke after months of unemployment. Sonny is a member of a motorcycle club, Widow. Sonny then took her in and found her a job. As receptionist to a tattoo shop owned by Dex, also a member of Widow, an ex-felon, hot, gorgeous with lots of tattoos and whom she has seen casually always with a handful of women. 
 Iris did not want to work for Dex but she had no choice and Dex definitely didn't look like he liked her, he was rude and impatient. So, much as she hated Dex, it was either the tattoo shop or the strip club. 
 The good: 
 I always love a bad ass biker romance story... and Dex is definitely bad ass. ;) 
 I like that they didn't get together instantly.... they started off obviously in the wrong foot, then friendship, then love and sex. 
 I love that Dex calls her ""babe"" even before they got together. 
 Iris, I felt bad for her, after everything she went through, add to that an a-hole of a father... she's a survivor and a fighter. She doesn't want to be anyone's burden. And she will do everything for the people she love. 
 There is humour, tension and some action. Not to forget, the romance and the hot sex. And I like the ending. 
 Not so good: 
 The story is so long! Not that long is bad. But a lot of it are Iris's thoughts rambling on and on. Like when on a conversation, you have to wait for her answer after her after she's finish with her thoughts. 
 Then there's her constant gagging... like a lot on anything and everything almost! Seriously, that's not good. 
 Then there's her term for her grandma, ""yia yia""... which at first I really didn't get. 
 I wish this wasn't written on a single POV... though I'm not sure if that's a bad thing considering the story is already too long. 
 So all in all, it was alright.

4,Of course it was excellent. Brandon wrote it. Can't wait for the next one.
5,"There is just no way for me to write a coherent review for this book after that ending. But as a professional, I must try. 
 When I first started this book I was totally heartbroken for both June and Day, leaving someone to avoid them pain is, I'm sure one of the hardest things that one could ever do. And Day left half of the things he loved when he left June. 
 The political resonances of this novel are to me one of the main facts why it is so fascinating, the allies, the enemies and the bargains they had to make with eachother are fascinating to me. Once again, I love how Marie Lu created a US society where the trouble is internal, I found myself incredibly surprised and happy that she didn't drag Mexico to the trouble. (Yes, Suzanne Collins, that one was for you). 
 I will not make a whole essay here, you seriously need to read this trilogy because there are no words of mine that can describe how incredibly good it is. 
 The ending was artistic. So of course, it got me a sobbing babblering mess. The pilogue was even better, so of course I had to hug myself and then hug my puppy while I ketp on sobbing. I'll just tell you this, if you're a romantic like me, well... you're gonna suffer, but you'll be very happy about it. 
 Quote: ""I scream for everything that has gone wrong. I scream for everything broken in our lives""."
3,"I enjoyed elements of this book. The paranormal entity was interesting and I liked that the pursuit of it was handled in a manner concurrent with paranormal research as it exists today. (I actually have a friend who does this stuff.). Nothing they were trying was outside of modern realism as long as you accept and believe in the possibility of the paranormal/ghosts among us. I appreciated that this particular book took the realistic slant. 
 I liked the characters in the story as well. And I was cheering for Bo and Sam's attraction to one another. But this story does have one element that I really dislike. I hate seeing the married but confused and while things don't go all the way there it's still cheating to me. It irks me. 
 Still I enjoyed the story and would be curious about another book in the serious. I understood the way the ending came about but I wasn't actually expecting it and didn't love it but it was fitting for the story in some ways. 3.5 stars overall."
4,"Review also posted at Ja citam, a ti? 
 At first I though I wouldn't like this book cause I was not fan of books that were based on something as popular as Titanic. It was just I preferred when someone created something new. I was wrong, mostly. 
 You've all seen Titanic so yeah you know the story. There is a boy and there is a girl and they fall in love. In this case he is rich and noble and she is just a maid. That's good enough reason for two of them to apart but it's not so strict considering that the roles are vice versa. When a rich man falls in love with poor woman then it's not as shocking as in original story. Now we come to the part that blow me away. I read the blurb and crature is not mentioned so we'll call it they from now on. So they are something unnaturan and dangerous and author managed to perfectly fit them into the story. Good thing is you have picture of Titanic and everything seems possible. That's the part I really admire, cause it's not easy thing to do. 
 Partly I wonted to dislike this book so that I can write bad review about using popular things. But the truth is I couldn't. Even though this was instalove which makes me roll my eyes all over again still I could feel it. Good thing is also that in the end this book could've finished differentely and it'd be also very good ending. Maybe I'd love this book more if the end was opposite but I like it this way too. 
 I cannot tell you a lot about the stroy cause I don't want to spoil things for you, but all in all this was an interesting read and I enjoyed."
4,"I loved the characters in this story, and having read the first 3 Black Jewels novels, I enjoyed going back to the world (even though it is SO DARK!). 
 I figured out pretty early that (view spoiler)[the invisible ring was actually the non-existent ring, (hide spoiler)] and the main character frustrated me a bit when he was so slow to figure out that the witch who had bought him wasn't really evil. 
 I find it interesting to consider how this book would read if the genders were switched. It seems like all the horrible things that happen to the males in these books (shaving!!?? how icky is that???) would not be tolerated if they were being done to women. 
 I'd definitely like to finish this series. Looking forward to getting back to Daemon and Janelle."
3,I can't help being reminded of Twilight and Lost. The plot seems weak although it is writing is engaging. Considering the book is so short I will give the second one a shot.
4,"If I didn't like the characters so much it'd be a 3.5, but either way the lowest rating I've ever given a Robin Hobb book. 
 You can definitely tell this is the first half of a larger book that was forcibly split. It's unfortunate. The ending is very anticlimactic, sudden, and kind of dull. But that being said, good characters, good potential, I still love you Robin Hobb."
4,3.5 Stars rounded up~
5,"The final installment of the Darkest Powers triology! As per usual, spoiler on previous books. 
 The ending of the storyline was wonderful. I loved the evolution of the characters, most especially, of course, Chloe. In this final book we really see her come into her own and come to grip with her new identity. She plays the perfect character for me - with an excellent balance between her strengths and her vulnerablities. I'd say this is my favourite part of Armstrong's writing - that her characters, albeit supernatural, are real and as such make the series much easier to believe as you read it. The same goes with Armstrong's numerous twists in the plotline throughout the entire series; normally, this type of conspiracy & etc could cause the book to be difficult to read but she plays with it so well that the concern is unfounded. 
 The way the novel ended makes me really interested in reading another. Mayhaps not one directly involving these characters but set in the same enviroment, maybe with cameos a la Tamora Pierce? Either way I greatly enjoyed this series and Armstrong's writing ability was wonderful."
4,just read it. that is all i'm going to say.

4,"The story had a beautiful message that it's much better to form an opinion of someone through your own interactions with them rather than basing it on rumours or another person's opinion. 
 The ending was a bit weak in that (view spoiler)[Lilly was putting her life on hold and living for Colton by going overseas with him... (hide spoiler)] I think it could have ended in a more satisfying way."
3,"No Good Duke Goes Unpunished: The Third Rule of Scoundrels The third book in the Rules of Scoundrels series, is about Temple (the boxer and enforcer of The Angel) and Mara, the girl who was believed to be dead AND the reason why Temple was banished from society. 
 I had great expectations in this book since I have been quite intrigued about Temple since I read about him in A Duke by Any Other Name (Rules #1). I was dying to find out who would be his salvation but I was a little bit surprised that MacLean paired him with Mara the person he was believed to have killed. Although no body was found, Temple has been under a shadow of doubt and was already guilty in the eyes of the Ton and everyone in society. Although the interactions between both Mara and Temple were sizzling, I just could not begin to understand how these two fell in love (more like lust) with each other. 
 First of, I had difficulty understanding the reasoning behind Mara's plot to be ""dead."" It all just seemed so shallow to me. I mean, she just didn't want to marry the Duke of Lamont (Temple's father) so she shirked her duties and concocted a plan to disappear, seemingly dead or something so no one would look for her and in the process, condemn Temple to a life in the shadows. I just don't know what to say. I did not think that Temple would forgive HER for whatever reason and I think what they felt for each other was just NOT love. Add to that her reasons for groveling to Temple: her brother had racked up a lot of debts at The Angel and he wanter her to save him. I just felt like I wanted to scream in frustration! 
 So, in exchange for forgiving the debt owed by her brother, Mara said that she will return to society and in doing so, prove to the Ton and society that Temple (William Harrow, Duke of Lamont) is really innocent. I could not believe that Temple fell for it! Again, it was too shallow for me. I just could not understand it. I know I am repeating myself but I just can't help myself. 
 Now I had been intrigued by Temple and I just could not believe the injustice that had forced him to be banished/exiled from society. Temple has embraced his reputation as the Killer Duke and is formidable in the ring and as an enforcer for The Angel. Everyone quakes when they hear his name. He is unbeatable in the ring. And yet, he was felled by Mara who didn't even do anything to earn his love. I just could not understand it! I can't understand how Temple was redeemed. 
 I love the books that I read by MacLean but I just couldn't stomach this story. The only redeeming part of this book is Chase's revelation (which is why I gave this 3 hearts). THAT one was a shocker!

5,"(This book is better than Tangled...and Prince Nicholas is better than Drew.) 
 There...I said it and I'm not hiding behind my kindle to say it (mostly). 
 Ms. Chase has absolutely done it again with this book. She has written the perfect story with the most perfectly imperfect characters. She has again given us a pompous, self-righteous, gorgeous, endearingly sweet yet sometimes ignorant Prince (literally). She has also given us a strong, independent, beautiful and vulnerable would be princess...from New York. 
 Nicholas and Olivia are perfect for each other...they share a witty banter, off the charts sexual chemistry and a pure, unadulterated love that can't be broken by royal rules (right?!?). Ms. Chase effortlessly showed us the chains that bind both Olivia and Nicholas, while worlds apart, are identical and both somewhat heartbreaking. They show each other how the other half lives and it is fascinating to watch each of them learn the sometimes harsh realities of the world while enjoying the unrealistic glamour of it. 
 The supporting cast is outstanding - all of them. We even get the quintessential gay best friend but this one is better because he isn't the stereotyped flamboyant, over the top gay best friend. Henry's story is next...and you can bet your sweet a$$ it's going to be amazing and a must read. 
 The bottom line is: you have to read this book. You will sigh, cry and laugh out loud. And you won't regret any part of the time you spent inside this story."
5,"One of the best books I read this year was truly terrifying. To get scared of a book is quite an achievement as not a lot scares me in terms of books and films anymore. So for this book to make me creeped out and scared thinking about it while going to bed means it's a good horror book finally. I hadn't heard a lot about it which was surprising because to me the blurb is really what made me interested. To be scared of something you can't see is what makes it scary as our brain will always imagine something scarier than what any writer could write. That's what made this amazing. 
 This is told from two different timelines the present which shows Malorie our main character trying to survive with her two four year old children. In a world where if you look outside you will kill yourself and other people. What makes them kill themselves who knows. The only protection they have is to barricade themselves inside with blankets up at windows and walking around with blindfolds on. Malorie has trained her children to survive in this world where they have never seen the outside. It is truly scary especially when they have to go down this never ending river where they are blindfolded and can only go by her children's hearing. That's why it was so unique was this scenes where all the descriptions you got was sound and physical it made the hair stand up when the children heard something they could not see. 
 The other timeline is four years before this where Malorie is pregnant and more softer as a person. We see how it all began and Malorie finds herself in a safe house with other people who are trying to make out what is going on just like she is. 
 This was defiantly a creepy book with lots is scenes of suicide so for people who don't like be warned. It was one of the better horror books I've read and one of the best I read this year. If you haven't heard of it you need to read it. I still think about it now what could it be out there."
2,"Originally posted on my blog: The Writer's Inkwell 
 There have been moments while reading the previous three volumes, where I've found myself thinking, ""What the hell am I reading?"" But then the comic returns to its roots and I find myself loving it once again. 
 This is not one of those moments. As much as I enjoyed the idea of Buffy essentially going to the future, there were so many out there moments that I just found myself overwhelmed. It was as if Whedon just threw everything at the wall and went with whatever happened to stick. And I think that is the problem with these comics. Yes, the show had demons, monsters, vampires, witches, etc. But they didn't rarely had dozens of these things happening all at once. It was always one or (at the most) two obstacles to overcome. 
 The way this comic series is going, I'm finding myself more and more confused because there are so many random events. Case in point: Dawn magically goes from a 20 foot girl to a centaur. How did that happened and why the hell has the series still not explained what a freaking thricewise is? Also, yes, I understand Buffy is went to a dystopian future, but why couldn't the only remaining slayer speak a real sentence? Is it supposed to be a form of broken English because it's not her first language or is that the new English of the future? 
 I just wish more would go into the actual plot development and execution of this particular volume. It had potential, but the execution was poor and I'm not a fan."
5,"I just adored this. 
 I loved Jake. I was so invested in everything turning out well for him. I loved the food and the whole restaurant storyline. And everything came together so perfectly^^ I am still smiling <3"
4,"The Book of Life is a fast-paced and thrilling conclusion to the All Souls Trilogy that was almost as enjoyable as the first two novels. Full of magic, mayhem, and a chase to the end, it's hard not to get caught up in the story. 
 I've read reviews about how much the characters change and I agree that by the end of the third book, Diana is like a completely different person but in some ways, that makes sense. Although not based on a teenager, the trilogy is almost a coming of age story for Diana, wherein she discovers who and what she is. She is bound to be completely different by the end. Other characters changes are more difficult to explain away (apart from all the major life events that they go through) but are also less prominent. 
 I was amused by Harkness' desperate attempt to keep equality throughout the novel, which is remarkably difficult when you base an entire trilogy around a patriarchal system but she did it well enough, making Diana as an equally important family member as Matthew. Why, she even has Marcus (view spoiler)[allow women into the Knights of Lazarus! (hide spoiler)]. How Miriam hadn't fought for that years ago, given the strong and forbidding character that she is, I do not know. 
 The book is not all great though. 
 At some points, there are so many characters it is almost impossible to keep up with who is who. The only thing to do is to let go of trying to work out who is who and hope it all comes together in the end - it sort of does (or at least, not knowing doesn't cause any major problems). 
 I also found myself zoning out through the soppy love sections and especially during the long-winded birthing process. And the jumps between narrator? Frustrating and unnecessary. It almost reads like Harkness couldn't decide whether she wasn't to write from Diana's POV or not. 
 There are lots of loose ends that aren't tied up too. 
 (view spoiler)[ 
 - The whole deal with the Book of Life was not satisfactorily dealt with. What was in it? Why? Who made it? If the rest of the world were so desperate to get their hands on it, why are they okay to just sit back and accept that the book is now part of Diana? 
 -What happened with Corra? Why did she feel so trapped - she was a familiar, she was where she was supposed to be. This plot point wasn't dealt with and I'm not even sure what the point of Corra was at all to be honest. 
 -How did Satu manage to hide the fact that she was a weaver for so long, given that we were already told that weavers can't cast other people's spells? 
 -How did the witch with vampire/witch lineage manage to hide that for so long, given that she and her family have lived such long lives - surely the vampires would have noticed that and wondered why this witch family had such fantastic longevity? 
 -Since Benjamin had already fathered a child, why didn't he come out about it sooner? Why was he only doing so much in apparent reaction to Matthew/Diana? 
 -If Matthew walked into Benjamin's trap purposely, why did he let himself get so beat up? Why didn't he come up with a better plan than that? 
 -Diana get so drained by the use of magic sometimes but at others, seems to use her magic like it's nothing. 
 -What the hell does Diana look like by the end of the book? Is she going to have to use a disuising spell forever to cover up all the crazy tattoos, shadows, scars, the tree coming out of her head, and the numbers whirring through her eyes? 
 -The Blood Rage... 
 (hide spoiler)] 
 If you want to read this book because you want to enjoy the flow of narrative, because you want to visit the characters again, because you want a book full of magic and ancient texts and intrigue, then great. But if you want answers to all the questions that you had through the first two books, and if you want everything tied up with a pretty bow on top, then you are probably going to be disappointed."
5,"A brilliant rendition of classic fairytales into complex and feminist-themed dark, sensual stories. 
 Really, these stories are really fucking erotic."
4,"I really enjoyed it, especially because it was very different than the movie and therefore i could still be suprised by what happened. I liked the way they portrayed Oz as a ""humbug"". Very worth a read."
4,"A.M Arthur is one of my comfort reads, and this one is no exception. The MC's are likeable, engaging... as are the supporting characters. 
 Both MCs are scarred, both in different ways, both dealing with their issues in their own way, but despite them, they find each other and work through them together. They find strength in a relationship that surprises them both. 
 I look forward to the next installment in this series."
2,"Kate Malvern is 24 and has no relations or money. Just as she is contemplating sinking beneath the boundaries of gentility and becoming a domestic servant, her heretofore unmet aunt descends upon her. She is the Lady Broome, and she overwhelms Kate with kindess and brings her to Staplewood, the ancestral home of the Broomes. There is clearly something sinister going on at Staplewood, focused around Kate's moody cousin Torquil. Thankfully, Kate finds an ally in Philip Broome, with whom she shares spirited banter. 
 Heyer does not spend much time distinguishing Kate and Philip. They are the hero and heroine of the story, and that's that. She spends a great deal of time on Torquil, and therein lies my big disappointment. Cousin Kate begins like a light hearted romp, and ends like a light hearted romp, but in the middle everyone gives long monologues about how Torquil is mad, mad I tell you and the great tragedy of it all. In fact, the happy ending comes mere pages after two violent deaths, yet the victims' relatives are apparently far too pleased with the impending marriage of Philip and Kate to mourn. It's a disjointed book, and one that owes rather too much to the overwrought gothic novels of the nineteenth century. I'm also annoyed in the presentation of Torquil's madness--I read him like Colin from The Secret Garden, as an under-socialized, high-strung and insensitive spoiled brat. He doesn't have trouble distinguishing reality or anything, but everyone around him takes it for granted that he needs to be institutionalized. Even the eventual deaths don't seem like proof of madness to me. I was puzzled. Didn't they have a slightly better understanding of mental illness when this was written, in the twentieth century? Torquil wasn't mad--just badly raised."
4,"I have never been a reader of 'sports book', but here is a book that will appeal to sports fan and non-fans alike - even if the feature sport is track. Ghost is a story about a kid finding something he loves doing, and learning how to push himself and be better. This is the first book I've read by Reynolds. Now I can see his appeal!"
4,"1. Story: 
 Birthmarked was a splendid change of pace. It takes place in a vague, dystopian future, where the lakes have run dry and much technology has degenerated to medieval levels. A small population of technologically advanced, well fed, and privileged people live in the walled Enclave. 16 year old Gaia, midwife in training, grew up outside of the Enclave. As a midwife, Gaia is must ""advance"" the first three babies she delivers each month. This means that the first three babies are brought to the Enclave, where they will be placed in one of the families and adopted as their children-providing they are unblemished and whole. Gaia stood no chance of ever being accepted into the Enclave, as half of her face is marred by a terrible burn scar she received as an infant. Gaia envies the advanced children, and she doesn't question the Enclave's right to take them until Gaia's gentle, obedient parents are arrested. 
 2. Plot/Pacing 
 This book has an even, peaceful pace-no frenetic action sequences to make us think we're interested. Instead, the author relies on the strong, nurturing moral courage of Gaia. There are some twists on the typical dystopia. For example-all the people in the Enclave are not evil, but human-with full personalities, desires, and motives. Also, the reverence for life and the focus on pregnancy, family, and childbirth makes a tired genre fresh again. And Gaia's parents . . . their example and love is the foundation for Gaia's character. They were such a relief. 
 3. Characters 
 Gaia is smart, loyal, and nurturing. Her life skills, love for her parents, and ideals make her a believable and compelling character. Secondary characters, such as Gaia's parents, Leon (love interest), and Sephie (a doctor), are spare but layered and well drawn. Leon is a standout-a tortured young man with a truly terrible backstory. He is no drama queen, and his coping mechanism-apathy-can be chilling. The story behind his troubles is a brilliant plot element. Gaia and Leon's relationship is slow-growing and thoughtful, free of the melodrama, cliches, and third wheel present in most books of this type. Also, all of the characters were a mixture of good and bad qualities, ideals, and motives. This made the ""heroes"" worth rooting for, and the ""villains,"" realistic. 
 To summarize: a quiet story with heavy themes and observations-highly recommended."

3,"I absolutely love the brother heroes in the Sweetest Kisses series, and Mac is no exception. Mac is smart, tender, and a real gentleman. Not to mention he's very sexy, and good with animals (which is also sexy in a different way). I like Sidonie, although I don't like her as much as I like Mac. Sid is willing to stand up for what she feels is right, although she seems to be fairly passive in her fighting against the injustices levied against her. What I don't like here is Mac and Sid together. The jump to love feels to abrupt to me. Also, they don't seem to have a lot of chemistry. Their lovemaking is sweet and slow, but I don't truly feel the passion between them. KISS ME HELLO is a gentle and slow romance, and Grace Burrowes, normally one of my current favorite authors, has written much more compelling books.

3,Very good. More fast paced than book 1. I only got slightly annoyed with Tris & Four's touchy teen feelings.
1,"A book about a boy who falls in love with a sweet dullard. 
 This is my first Sparks novel. I thought I should give at least one a try, since I have so many friends who LOVE him. Also because now I can say how bad NS is and know what I'm talking about. Now, I'm not a fan of love stories. Actually, that's not entirely true. I like romance, but only if it is a small part of a larger story. I came into it with very low expectations 
 It was very cliched. From the prologue I new straight away (view spoiler)[that Jamie was going to die. The wedding was also easy to see. (hide spoiler)] Oh, and Jamie, she is just too good. Her character is so unbelievable. 
 Some things that particularly annoyed me: 
 ""...if you know what I mean"". Yes, I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN!!! 
 ""...I've been wondering what to do for the orphanage this year. I've been praying about it for months now because I want this Christmas to be the most special one of all"" 
 Honey, maybe you should think about a way of improving christmas for the orphans, instead of praying for it. 
 ""It was, I remembered thinking, the most difficult walk anyone ever had to make. In every way, a walk to remember"". 
 You don't say? But, that's the name of the TITLE! I wouldn't have picked it, so thank you so much for pointing it out to me. 
 Yes I cried, but that was because Sparks used specific plot points and language to make me cry, you know, like (view spoiler)[seventeen year olds falling in love and then dying. (hide spoiler)] 
 But there was one thing in this book that was worse than all the sappy love story stuff. It was the religion. Every single sentence has something about god, or praying etc. Mr Sparks, if I wanted to be preached to, I would go to a church. 
 All this saccarine, mushy, lovey dovey stuf has taken its toll on my reading life. I think I might now go off and finish Blood Meridian to cleanse my palate."
5,"Wow I really liked the first book 
 unbeautiful 
 and couldn't wait for the second. Now I didn't think it was bad but, I do wish it was a little longer. To me 
 Untamed 
 was a little to short. I thought the first book and second could of been together as one book. I will say though, I do like Emery and Ryler they were really meant to be together. I hated how her parents treated her and how her ex was so mean And It was really awful what Ryler had to go threw. I'm glad Emery had Ryler to look out for her, I don't know what she would of done without him. 
 This is my idea of their night out with Violet and Luke 
 I wasn't sure how the end was going to go and started getting worried the more Emery's dad told Ryler to do something or when agent Stale was getting on him to find out more info. Seeing what Ryler and Emery both have been through and now go through is so sad. You Feel so bad for them. But I will say after it all and in the end I am happy with how it all turnd out. 
 ""I'm afraid of never getting out of this life unless it's in a coffin"" 
 ""I've put a lot of trust in Ryler, spilled secrets people would kill me for. Either it'll eventually set me free- he'll set me free. Or it'll end up killing me in the end, the choice is his."" 
 I'm not who you think I am. I'm as lost as you. I just want to be free. You and me, we're not so different. Night and morning on the outside, we're simply day on the inside."" 
 Nice book Jessica I can't wait for what's next."
3,"I'm annoyed by this because I was just expecting more. It just dissolved into a romance-fest, and I still have no idea what the plot is or who the bad guys are. Harper is still fantastic though. Review to come."
4,"3.5 - 4 stars. 
 I just finished Something Strange And Deadly, by Susan Dennard. This book wasn't what I thought it would be, but I enjoyed it all the same. 
 Sixteen-year-old Eleanor Fitt's plate is full. Her father has passed. Her brother is missing. And her mother depends on her to take care of the household but expects her to do it in the manner befitting a lady of high society, despite the fact that their financial reserves are dried up. If that weren't enough, the Dead are rising in Philadelphia. Eleanor pieces together the information she has about her brother's disappearance and goes to the Spirit Hunters, a group hired to protect the city from supernatural forces. No one in her life is being forthcoming, but she refuses to give up. When the situation becomes dire, she finds herself in the middle of the chaos. 
 Let me start by saying that I am not a giant fan of historical fiction. I love stories set in the future, but somehow when time moves backwards, I have more trouble connecting to the characters and action. I suppose I find it difficult to imagine myself in that setting, particularly in a time where I would not have been allowed to speak my thoughts or been given the freedom to move and act according to my own preferences. My aversion to this genre notwithstanding, I thought Dennard did a tremendous job with the writing. She used language that befitted 1876 without slowing down or confusing the story. And this story is absolutely brimming with action. The phrase ""hardly a dull moment"" is certainly an apt one to describe the never ending onslaught of danger and attacks. Dennard excelled at keeping the plot moving and the reader interested. 
 I liked the characters, admired them even, but I didn't connect on a personal level with them. I loved Eleanor's spunk. She is brave and acts in spite of her fears. Though she does get overwhelmed by the enormity of her task from time to time, it never takes her long to pick herself up by her bootstraps and rededicate herself to the next step she needs to take. There was definitely emotion to her character, but I never really felt like I understood what she wanted for her future, for her heart. Not with any certainty anyway, and at best in vague glimpses or hopes. 
 Jie was cool and unexpected. And I thought Joseph was a commanding leader for the Spirit Hunters. We're given more insight into Daniel's character than the others, and I liked him. His connection to Eleanor was more subtle than I hoped it would be. He cared for her, at least on some level, though I couldn't help but feel that something held him back, be it standing or circumstance or some unknown reason. (view spoiler)[I did not like how he turned away from Eleanor at the end. I was proud of her for asking him directly if he was in love with her. (hide spoiler)] In Elijah's absence, I thought Clarence did a good job mirroring the fears of the people of Philadelphia with regard to the undead. I liked him. He was more honest than some in the book, even if it was because Eleanor was observant. 
 I missed more concrete connections between the main characters. Everyone seemed most concerned with themselves, with the exception of the Spirit Hunters, whose main concern was stopping the Dead, and Eleanor, who was focused on finding her brother. Either way, the collective focus of the characters was on abstract parts of the story--a lost man, zombies, fear of the Dead and being killed. There was only a small amount of attention paid to how the characters felt about one another. I blame the genre to some extent. In 1876, people were more closed off and guarded, behaving in a way that fit their status, in a way that was expected by the rest of society. That makes the connections between people more difficult to glean. They're less pronounced, less obvious or less certain. The only way to make them certain, if not by actions, is through spoken words, and most people only told the truth when forced. 
 If you like zombies or historical fiction, you'll probably like this book. I'm going to happily dive into the second book now."
5,"I'm extremely proud to say that the rating that you're seeing above this review is not a mistake. 
 THIS BOOK WAS A FIVE STAR READ FOR ME!!!! YAAAAAAAH! (My first 5-star book!) 
 Now I know this might not be a big deal for some of you. You're probably thinking ""I gave 5 stars to like 50 other books--what's so special about a 5 star rating from YOU?"" 
 Out of every book I've read, I've always found flaws in some form whatsoever (which is absolutely, positively OKAY because what kind of life would we be living if there were no flaws?). It's either because the writing drags on into the realm of boredom, or maybe it's cliche, or maybe I just had to pitch the thing across the room in some point of my consciousness. I've always given four-stars to the books with the most MINOR mistakes that I've ever seen. 
 But this one? This one got a five star rating...why? 
 BECAUSE I WAS TRULY ASTOUNDED BY THIS FREAKING BOOK! 
 1. It had VOICE!!! VOICE, I TELL YOU!!!!! It went no where NEAR the realm of boredom! It was totally in...the realm of NOT BOREDOM!! 
 It wasn't in that icky melodramatic tone that's in most YA's these days. ""I ran. I ran from the beast with fear in my grasp. Oh my. How frightened I was..."" 
 It was more like, ""I tromped down the path away from the beast, flailing my arms like a monkey and droning one long, monotonous scream through the entire event."" (<-Trust me, that's how I would run away from a beast.) 
 Well--no, none of the sentences in this book had anything to do with running from a beast. This was just my (lame) example of how this book added comedy to it's pages to actually invite the reader into reading instead of that whole ""Edward/Bella moment"". 
 2. IT TAUGHT LIFE LESSONS. 
 In some of the YA's that I've read so far, I skim through the whole entire book and try to wonder... ""WHAT'S THE LESSON THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO TEACH?!"" 
 Each story should have a theme to it. Sure, you might want to create a story where two characters fall in love--but it shouldn't be in the situation where in the first chapter, ALL THEY DO IS EXCHANGE A GLANCE and in the next 30 pages, one of the characters is like ""I need you. I can't stay away from you."" 
 NO!!!! THAT IS NOT A LIFE LESSON!!!! In life, when you meet someone, THERE IS NO WAY THAT TRUE LOVE WILL MAKE ITSELF APPEAR IN THE SPAN OF 48 HOURS!!!!! 
 Well--this book is mainly about a girl, Brooklynn Pierce, who decides that since all of her decisions must be purely rigged so that they all happen to ruin her life, she creates a blog in order to post her decisions for blog readers to choose for her. The thought running through her head is that since she must be the worst decision maker EVER, she can have a bunch of other people vote which decisions they think is best and therefore, Brooklynn shouldn't be able to make any mistakes. 
 But this book's life lesson is that you should make the choice for yourself because you CAN make a choice. There are also some things that you can't choose yourself. (Now THAT is something I learned myself through life experiences LONG before I started to read this book.) I'll let you guys figure out what that is by READING THE BOOK YOURSELF!!!! :D 
 And every day is a choice. You make choices every day (no matter how minor they are--like what food you eat, or what you say...). Since you make so many choices in a life time, YOU'RE BOUND TO MAKE MISTAKES, right?? That's what life is about! 
 And since Brooklynn thought that she seemed to be surrounded by perfect people, throughout the story, she learns that everyone makes mistakes (even the most perfect of people) and that perfection is only an illusional word and that her thoughts of everyone else's perfection is an illusion. 
 This book truly presents life lessons that are ACTUALLY REAL. I really want to meet Jessica Brody! 
 3. Wording! WORD CHOICE! DESCRIPTIONS! Eh-ti-cuh! 
 Jessica Brody's descriptions and wording and metaphors ARE SO BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN!!! She doesn't use plain, old, boring words like ""walked"". She uses ""tromp"" ""strut"" ""stumble"". 
 Her descriptions are so precise and I can just imagine the settings that she sets up for the readers DIRECTLY IN MY HEAD!!! That's definitely also worth 5-stars, right?? 
 4. Symbolization!! 
 When Brooklynn has to read to Mrs. Moody during her community service hours, Jessica Brody CREATIVELY chooses the ""You Choose The Story"" series to represent decisions. When they read through the story and Mrs. Moody always steered the decisions in a path where they always ended up being eaten by alligators or stepped on by giant dinosaurs, they always flipped right back to the beginning of the book to start over again and to make different decisions. 
 Now what the author is trying to show the readers is: Wouldn't it be easier if life was similar to this? When you ended up in an unfixable situation, you could just rewind back to the beginning and start over--this time avoiding the first choices and choosing different decisions in order to win. 
 Life isn't like this. When you're faced with a choice, you don't know WHAT'S going to happen next. It would be so easy if we could just fast forward to see our results if we do a specific thing and then rewind back and be sure that the decision we make is correct. Or we could just rewind back to the beginning when we face a blinking, bold GAME OVER shoved in our faces so we could know what we should choose. 
 But who said life was easy? When you're in a sticky situation where all of your choices are revealed and you finally know what you SHOULD have chosen, you can't just press the ""RESET"" button. All you can do is sigh and think ""I shouldn't have chosen this"" or ""I should have done that instead."" 
 Trust me, whenever I get a test handed back with a bunch of red pen strokes smeared across the pages, I skim through the test thinking ""I should have known this! I should have known that!! CAN I HAVE A REDO?!"" 
 The author understands this, and so she presents it in her story. BEAUTIFUL!!! ASTOUNDING!!! 
 5. Cliffhangers. 
 I always promised myself that I'd limit myself to ONE CHAPTER of this book because if I got too lost in the book, I wouldn't be able to complete my homework. 
 But the cliffhangers at the end of these chapters (and the cliffhangers that the pages of the MyLifeUndecided.com Blog presented) always made me turn some more pages. 
 THIS BOOK IS NOT PREDICTABLE. It is FREAKING UNPREDICTABLE!!!!!! I ran into a bunch of surprises in this book, and JESSICA BRODY WEAVED EVERYTHING TOGETHER SO WELL!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Throughout the book, Brooklynn did seem to change her actions over the span of 6 weeks. At times, she would reveal to the readers in her narrating what she would have said or done before the moment the book started (when she was popular and best friends with the ""princess"" of the school). But near the end of the book, her actions compared to the actions she would have created if she was still the way she was REALLY made the way she has changed her ways stand out. 
 This book is a truly BEAUTIFUL, FIVE-STAR BOOK. I love this freaking book. 
 Wow, this is my longest book review ever. ANYWAY YEAH, I LOVED THIS BOOK. 
 I recommend this to the fellow humans in search for a humorous tale of a decisionally challenged girl."
5,"""Stay gold, Ponyboy"" 
 I will forever tear up when I see or hear those words. This book has utterly destroyed my heart; I cried, smiled, and now I'm just blank because this book brought out so many unexpected emotions from me and I now understand why it is a classic. 4 out of 5 stars, fast read but a powerful read as well."
4,"Soooooo RJ is supposed to be a mean girl? Because i didn't really get that vibe. She had done bad things yes, and made bad judgments but I don't think it warranted her being called EVIL! Just me? Idk... 
 Anyway it was an interesting read :) Would recommend reading!"
3,"I like When the Sea is Rising Red. 
 ***** 
 This book is so weird. Fortunately, I like weird. Having said that, When the Sea is Rising Red is not for everybody. and I meant that. I'm impressed with Hellisen because she is not afraid to tell a story that is a whole new level of different. So, the questions is: Are you bold enough to read this? 
 Felicita was stunned when her best friend Ilven committed suicide. When she realized she's facing the same situation that made Ilven jumped, she ran away after faking her own death. Living in the slums was a far cry from her High-Lammer life and Felicita almost succumbed to going back after every hardship. But she carried on, not knowing that she got caught in the uprising being brewed in Old Town. 
 I'm a little confused on the legends of sea-witches and boggerts, but i get the gist and it was fun. It reminded me of a folklore here in the Philippines about a body of water (say a river, or ocean) where people drowned. They say that the spirit or entity residing in that particular river/ocean requires a sacrifice every now and then in exchange for a bountiful catch. Quite scary, yes? It is similar with Hellisen's sea-witch. The Hobs and Low-Lammers are really scared of the sea-witch stories even when High-Lammers like Felicita doesn't believe in it. 
 The love triangle was actually not a love triangle per se, but it did involve Felicita, Dash, and Jannik, not in the way I expected. And this is my first encounter with weird. Ha! This book almost felt like a mystery/suspense because I keep solving and connecting the links! I guessed right, on how it gone down between the three, but it still was weird to me. Yeah, let's leave it at that, shall we? Like i said, I like weird. But hey, if indeed it was a love triangle, I'm all for Jannik. ;) 
 The fantasy element was quite good, especially Lil's magic. I really liked that concept. If this was a series, I would continue reading after this one. 
 I think I need to read this again. Once is not enough to fully capture and enjoy the rare story that Hellisen delivered. When the Sea is Rising Red is something that will tickle your dark imagination."
5,"Amazing Story. I was utterly captivated the first time I read it. I could not put it down and read it for 6 or 7 hours straight through. 
 This book deals with a dark subject. I think the writer executed beautifully. I have read this book 4 or 5 times and will be reading it yet another time before the release of the companion novel 'Breakable'. 
 I think any high school girl who is Junior or Senior should read this as well as anyone going into college, but also this can be enjoyed by people of all ages, above 17. 
 *Update July 9, 2015* 
 Just re read this book for like the 5th time and I loved it just as much now."
3,"Mostly sex. Some good ideas and worth reading, just not a favorite. Not enough showing in the story. 
 This is a series of five books. It is one story broken into five pieces. You need to read them in order. I like the unusual main character Silvio. He's a gorgeous looking gay guy age 24 - a killer for hire. Stefano is head of a mob/mafia family. He's young (33). He took over after his father's death. Stefano is happily married, but he is attracted to Silvio at first sight. I enjoyed the conflict watching Stefano discover his bisexual nature with Silvio. I liked the happy ending in book 5. 
 This book is mostly a lot of intense and lengthy gay guy sex scenes with back-door action and toys. Silvio needs pain during sex. There are menage sex scenes with men, and one menage with two men one woman. If that's your mood it's probably good. I skimmed most of those scenes. I like sex scenes in books, but I want a majority story, with a minority sex. 
 The story was lacking operational aesthetic. We didn't see how things were done, like how someone killed with a knife, the details during the sniper killings, the details about a bomb and how a character was saved from the bomb. None of that was shown. It was just telling after the fact. Silvio was haunted by something with Diego Carbone. I wanted to know details about that. We are told nothing. 
 Minor problems: 
 1. Too many characters had similar names beginning with S. I had to take notes to keep them straight. Stefano, Silvio Spadaro, Sergei, Sebastiano. 
 2. Too many Italian words were not translated for the reader. 
 DATA: 
 Narrative mode: 3rd person. Story length (for five books together): 269 pages. Swearing language: strong. Sexual language: strong. Number of sex scenes: 13 or more. Setting: current day mostly U.S. with some in Italy. Book copyright: 2011-2012. Genre: Crime Suspense, Gay Male Romantic Suspense."
5,ALL OF THE STARS. I GIVE THIS BOOK ALL OF THE BLOODY DAMNED STARS OF THE UNIVERSE
5,"So, Zane and Ty are like crack. I was a little worried when Madeline Urban retired from this power house of a writing duo, and some of the tone of the series has changed, but definitely not the level of quality. . . Or the hot feeb-y goodness. Like every other book in this series I giggled with happiness when it came out. I'm a hardcore, ambitious, ladder-climbing young executive playing in a boys club of a job. In general, I do not giggle. I got the publishing date wrong and downloaded the book today instead of on the 13th. I told myself I've worked a 85 hour week and another is coming up, but I can't stop reading. I took a break to grab some juice and decided to write this review. 
 Bottom line, it's 2:42 in the morning. I should be asleep after one of the busiest work weeks evah, but this book is so cracktastic I know I won't be going to bed until I finish it. 
 If you like cop dramas, if you like hot men, if you like complex evolving characters, if you like luuurve, read this book. 
 If you've already been introduced to this series, I don't need to tell you how awesome this is. You already know."
5,"I only started reading Christian Romance as a way to ease myself into the adult section of the library after the YA section was getting a little too young and redundant for me. At first I thought it'd be super cheesy {and it is, very frequently} but I also really like it. 
 (view spoiler)[ I liked that the wedding happened in the middle of the book, and not the end. It's hard to describe why. I think maybe it's because I'm married and like stories about married people. (hide spoiler)] 
 I didn't feel like the Christian aspect was forced or over played. I loved that when Meredith had a question she went to the scriptures to find her answer. Perfect. And there were scenes of everyday religious worship, as opposed to just silent prayers asking for help. I enjoyed that as well. 
 ""This business of wooing one's wife was complicated. The pitfalls were so well hidden, a man didn't even know they were there until he'd fallen into one."" {pg. 178} Haha. I liked Travis. 
 Also, I really need to adopt Meredith's view on laundry. ""A proud smile curved her lips"" because she was washing and hanging out ""her family's things. Her husband's things."" {pg. 164} The romance of my husband's and family's laundry has long since lost that appeal. Haha. 
 I barely finished this a couple days ago, and I find myself wanting to read it again already. I'm so excited there is another book about Crockett! 
 2nd reading: still love Meri and Travis. I need to buy this one for sure."
4,"It took me a long time to get my hands on this book. I kept my eye out for it everywhere! I wanted to read it so bad, so when I actually found it...it went on the top of my to-read pile. 
 I had read all different reviews for this book. It seems like you either LOVE it or HATE it??? I guess that I may be the exception because I was neither. I found the book to be a good read, but would not run out and buy my own copy...I guess that I could say that I do not HAVE to own it. 
 Bethany, her sister Ivy and her brother Gabe have been sent to Earth on a peaceful mission. They are not sure what the mission is yet, but will figure it out as they go along. This is Bethany's first trip to earth and in a human body, so you can only imagine some of the trials she goes through. 
 While I enjoyed the storyline, I found myself getting frustrated due to the MANY paragraphs describing what Bethany saw, felt and thought. I do enjoy getting into the minds of the characters, but this just seemed overboard. 
 My favorite character was Ivy. She tended to balance out Gabe and Beth. While Gabe would get very angry and Bethany would just go off and do whatever she wanted to without permission, Ivy tended to keep a level head and remain calm during complicated situations. 
 The relationship between Xavier and Beth, I thought was beautiful. I must be getting old because everyone that I conversed with stated that they thought it was really cheesy. I just chalked it up to being old-fashioned and the characters being super religious."

 Just looking at this cover brings back all of the feels and emotions of this story. It takes an awful lot for a book to make me cry and this made me ugly cry.

I don't say this often but I believe this book will change someone's life. 
 Adam and Julian are more than friends, they shared part of their childhood together when Julian lived with Adam as a foster child after his parents died. Julian left his happy life with Adam to life with his uncle, his only living relative. Life with his uncle turned out to not be as good as he had hoped. In fact, things were astronomically worse. But Julian is a people pleaser so he didn't want to rock the boat regardless of what it was doing to him. Little did Julian know that life would bring him and Adam back together at just the right time. Adam is thrust back into Julian's life when he is assigned to be the aide to the school psychologist. Adam is over the moon happy to be talking to Julian again but Julian isn't his normal outgoing self. That's when Adam realizes Julian is keeping secrets, dark secrets. Adam cannot sit by blindly while one of his friends, one that he considers a brother, has something awful happening. He sets out to find out what is going on with Julian and putting a stop to it, even if it puts both of them in harm's way. 
 Ten million stars. 
 That is how I rate this book. This book hooked me from the first few pages and never, ever let go.When I wasn't reading this story, I was thinking about reading this story. I wanted to carry these characters with me wherever I went just in case I could steal a few moments to read a few pages. The pure raw emotion that come from this story was so powerful that it is still with me now and I finished this book a couple of weeks ago. It is a beautifully haunting story about family, friendships, and brotherhood. This story also discusses ADHD, foster care, child abuse/neglect, trauma and so much more, so be aware that parts of this story will be difficult to read. This book is the trifecta and it is wonderfully done. The writing is masterful and you will finish without realizing how much you have read. Please note that all of these topics are very, very well discussed. They are not brought into the story just for the sake of a better story - they are legitimately very well thought out and brilliantly executed. 
 The two main characters now have a forever home in my heart. They felt so real and genuine that it was as if I could picture myself being friends with them in real life. 
 Adam has grown up with ADHD and most of his teachers just didn't know how to handle him in school. His mother made it one of her missions to get him off of all medicine and treat his ADHD with natural remedies. That type of mentality mixed with just being an overall good person meant Adam grew up being the embodiment of ""a good person"". He always had a bounce in his step and a smile on his face. He always wants to help everyone yet never take anything in return. He isn't in for ""what can you do for me?"". That is so refreshing in a protagonist. Adam quickly became one of my most favorite characters ever. 
 Julian had my heart from the moment he was introduced into the story. His soul is so pure that my heart broke with every struggle he had to endure. Reading everything he went through will shatter you but in the end, you will be mended. I promise. Just know Julian is another one of the most perfect characters I have ever read. I wanted to pull him out of the book, give him a huge hug, and tell him everything would be okay. I wanted to protect him from everything bad in the world. 
 The experiences Adam and Julian go through in this book test the boundaries of friendship but it also strengths them. They both grow so much. Adam already has a group of friends and happily brings Julian into the mix. Even though they did't think highly of Julian at first as they are Seniors and Julian is a Freshman, Adam does not let that bother him. He stands up for Julian every single time and that was so refreshing to read. Soon, everyone starts to see that Julian really is someone they want to have around. This group of friends will have a significant role later in the book. I won't give away anything here. 
 There is a line that is used in the book that hit me hard, ""Hate ricochets, but so does kindness"". This line was used in an exchange between Adam and Julian after Adam finds out some disturbing things Julian has gone through. It was said in regards to why the other chose to take the higher path of being positive instead of hitting back with anger and rage. This stayed with me because I feel this is something that almost all of us could stand remembering every single day. We could choose to be negative, hateful, and spiteful... but why? Just as much energy could be used to be positive and encouraging. Being nice to someone takes just as much of an effort as being mean. It is wasted energy with no real outcome. You can't pay forward anger, but you certainly can pay forward kindness. I thought this was a beautiful and thought provoking line. 
 I know that bad things happen every day in the world, but this book reminded me just how much it can affect not just the person but those around them. This book makes me want to be a better person and in that I feel this book succeeded where others have failed. I want to proudly display this on my shelf and highly recommend to every single person I come into contact with. I can say with absolute certainty that this book is already in my Top 5 Favorite Books of 2017. Please, add this to your TBR now, pre order it, request it from your library now. You will not regret it. If I could give this more than ten million stars, I would. It has earned every star in the universe."
4,"I don't know why i put off reading this book, it was really good!"
3,"I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but this book wasn't as good as previous Mercy Thompson books. And that's surprising because every single book before this has been amazing. That's not to say that it wasn't an enjoyable read, it was just really slow in parts. Learning about all of the different creatures in Mercy Thompson's world has been so exciting and interesting that I just figured that when we learned more about Mercy's heritage would be just as interesting. Sadly, I didn't care for it. 
 The good parts of the book though: MERCY AND ADAM!!! They really are the heart of this book and every scene with them was so much fun to read. The villian in this book was very creepy to me, which I liked. And the action packed ending completely made up for the parts I didn't enjoy. Not as good as the last books, but still pretty darn good."
3,"Original post at One More Page 
 When I was younger, I used to write stories about a group of friends who lived in Ireland. It was just a random country I picked out in the world atlas, and I thought I liked the sound of Ireland as a setting. Of course, I really knew nothing of the country then, and it wasn't until later on that I read and watched some stuff about Ireland on TV that I realized none of what I wrote was even the least bit realistic. But my recent trip to Europe got me to meet a YFC mission volunteer from Ireland, and meeting him reminded me of those days when I'd write those stories. 
 That's what made me pick up 
 There You'll Find Me 
 by Jenny B. Jones from my trip readings. Here we meet Finley Sinclair, 
 Save the Date 
 's Alex Sinclair's younger sister. After they had confirmed that Will, Finley's other brother, had died in an terrorist attack in a mission trip, she was devastated. Her life spun out of control as she tried to cope with her loss. After a year of therapy, she proved herself stable enough to go on an exchange student program to Abbeyglen, Ireland, one of the places that Will had gone to. Finley hopes to find herself and get answers from God who had seemed distant from her ever since she lost Will. But a movie star, the school's queen bee, a cranky and sick old lady puts a wrench on Finley's plans. As the pressure all around her builds, Finley starts dealing with things in the only way she knows how, even if it meant harming herself in the process. Can Finley find a way to get it right with God? 
 I liked Jenny B. Jones' other novel, 
 Save the Date 
 , a lot, so I was thrilled to find out that 
 There You'll Find Me 
 was a spin-off novel to that. I always like seeing how other characters I liked from a previous novel were doing in another novel that is not a sequel. 
 There You'll Find Me 
 is more YA this time around. Finley is such a strong-minded character, sometimes a bit stubborn, but we can also see that she has a big heart, especially with her friendship with her host sister, Erin and her concern for Cathleen Sweeney, the old woman she was assigned to visit for class. I liked Finley's voice, and I could definitely feel and relate with her need to control things. I liked that she wasn't portrayed as too depressed or too angry -- just very lost. And it made me want to wrap her up in a big, big hug, and tell her that God has not forgotten her. 
 And speaking of God. The spiritual aspect of this book is not preachy, and I think Jenny B. Jones excels at that. Well, compared to 
 Save the Date 
 , there were more mentions of God, but Finley was in a spiritual journey, so what do you expect? I liked the Finley's power verse, too, and I admit to shedding some tears at the moment when Finley found what she was looking for. The actual Irish journey was a treat to read, too, and I wished I was actually in Ireland to see the things that Finley was seeing. I wanted to spend a night at a pub enjoying good food, music and company. I want to look at the Celtic crosses that Finley was also looking for. Ireland sounds like a beautiful, beautiful place from the way it was described, and I have already written that place in my bucket list after I was done reading this. :D 
 There just seemed to be a little too many issues that Finley was trying to get over with in the book: grief, control issues, school stuff, Cathleen Sweeney, a possible eating disorder. Add romance to that and I'm surprised that Finley took that long before she had a melt down. I assume that it portrays real life, but it was just kind of hard to follow and it made the resolutions a little too quickly wrapped up. 
 And speaking of the romance. Unfortunately, I don't think there wasn't anything exciting about the romance, even if it was kind of sweet. I hope I'm not being cynical. I liked Beckett and I thought he was a nice guy, but I felt that the movie star + normal girl pairing has been done a few too many times. Plus points, though, on the development of their friendship to romance, which was fun to read. 
 There You'll Find Me 
 is a good follow up from Jenny B. Jones. A little bit paler in comparison to 
 Save the Date 
 , but nonetheless a good one. If you're looking for a clean contemporary novel that will tickle your romantic and traveling fancies, then I think you'll like this one. :) 
 Thanks, NetGalley!"
4,"Actually a 3.5 but Goodreads doesn't allow half ratings. 
 Filled with love and romance that didn't make me gag 
 In Asunder, Ana's story continues with life inside the city of Heart, a journey to her father's research lab, and many revelations. 
 It was a good follow up to Incarnate but I felt there was something missing. The action was good and there were plenty of events that built tension throughout the book. Still, I was left wanting some indefinable something ""more"". And not in the ""I can't wait for the next one"" kind of way. But of course I do definitely want to read the next book. Meadows has created a fascinating story and memorable characters. Twisted and cruel but beautiful and full of hope. 
 The relationship between Ana and Sam is wonderful. Meadows planted these seeds of doubt in me. Making me wonder things about Sam...is he a stereotype? An artist full of passion, with women falling in love with him and him never really falling in love with anyone? Or is his love the real deal? The kind that...check you would do anything for? 
 I love the twists and turns. There were some completely unexpected things and then some not so unexpected. Some things were obvious but I'm sure they were meant to be but others, zowwy, let's just say I liked that I couldn't figure everything or everyone out. 
 I do have one major bone to pick and that is the title ""Asunder."" The word is used so frequently in Ana's thoughts as a description of herself, usually coming at the end of a thought, as if it were its own sentence. The use of it was overdone and by the third time damn annoying. I don't know how many times it was used, but enough that I wish I had supreme edit power to take them all out. I didn't even feel like it fit most of the time. On a much smaller whiney note..I thought this cover completely didn't hold up next top the first one. On the Incarnate cover the model looked young and beautiful...but the same model on the second cover with slightly different set to her mouth just looked old and ugly. 
 It makes me super curious to see the next cover. I'm really interested to know what will happen next but not clamoring for it."
5,I absolutely adored this book! So clever and funny and full of magic. <3
1,Lol what the fuck was this shit?

5,"This series is hilarious and addicting. Definitely one of my new favorite series. 
 I would give a more thorough review than that, but as I'm back in school my free time is cut down again. Oh well."
4,"German Review on GosuReviews 
 I decided to do a review of the whole series(books 1-6) here, because all the books are relatively short. 
 These were the first books I read of John G. Hemry under his pseudonym Jack Campbell. He writes very gripping hard SciFi and I loved the enormous space battle scenarios throughout the book. Especially all the little nuances that get often times inadequately handled in other SciFi books. For example the time delay that orders take to travel within a fleet that is stretched over light minutes and a whole new approach to space battles, where these delays have an enormous influence. After having read this series I think you will look more skeptically on space battles in other scifi books. All this is very well explained and gives the series a unique feeling. 
 The Story is very clever done, with a believable plot, a troubling history and an amazing side plot that slowly( maybe too slowly) develops in the background. 
 I also enjoyed the three main characters, who get a fair bit of development, but get sadly stuck halfway through the series and their interactions in the later parts get very repetitive. And boy can this author write antagonists, very despicable opponents throughout. 
 These repetitions are the main weakness of the series in my opinion. Everything is very interesting in the beginning is very entertaining because it's new, but if you get a description of how Geary feels about the conference software in every book it kind of sucks. There are quite a few of these explaining repetitions throughout the books, that stand out if you read the six books back to back. The fault for this lies for me in the fact, that these books are so damn short and should have been written as a trilogy and edited accordingly. 
 This leads to a little lull in the action in book three and four. What happens in the last too books is then up to par again. 
 Okay that got a little bit longer than I expected so here a 
 tl;dr: 
 Great hard SciFi with amazingly innovative space battles and a gripping story."
2,It's Alex and La-Lionne's fault that I am going to read this book.
3,"2.75 stars 
 I didn't like it as much as I thought I would, based on the reviews. But I still liked it."
3,"Quite a fair YA read, once you can get pass the Me-Me-Me attitudes of Margot. 
 I know teenagers seek popularity, but in this case, to the extent that she would let the whole schoolmates remain zombies so she could have everything her way. I just can't love this girl in the beginning. 
 Luckily the story gets better in the later half--with the girl learning what's important and the vampire virus cured. 
 The idea of the school administrators wanting zombies as students for they are a lot easy to control is interesting. And with the main villain disappearing, I can see this as the beginning of a series."
3,"I am a fan of the Harry Potter series, and I was very curious to see what Rowling would do with an adult book. I didn't expect it to be remotely like her other books, either in tone or genre, but it also was not what I was expecting. I thought The Casual Vacancy would be more political, lighter, with more black humor. Instead it was pretty grim and bleak. But I still enjoyed it. 
 I continue to believe that Rowling would benefit from an editor with a firm hand. As with the last few Harry Potter books, Rowling's pacing was quite slow and the book probably could have been trimmed by 25% with no detriment to the plot. I do get that she intended the book to be a slow burn with an avalanche of an ending; and for me it did pack a punch. But the book was a slow read and there was little plot to speak of until the last quarter of the book. 
 Fortunately, Rowling has a great hand at characterization, and it may not be coincidental that the teens were the most vibrant and important of the characters in the book. Rowling writes with great sympathy of all her teens; much more than she does the adults. She has an omniscient narrator's voice that reminded me of Stephen King's mundane characterizations before the monster pops up in his narrative. (I found myself expecting something supernatural about a quarter way through-- her narrative tricks so mirrored King's.) 
 Unlike others,I didn't find the book dull-- I thought the character studies were very interesting and enjoyed them, slow as the plot was. 
 Still, it is hard not to read the book as a polemic-- as fanciful as the Potter series is, it seemed as if she were deliberately at her most mundane and adult as if showing us what her range could be. I was not surprised-- she reminds me of Roald Dahl, who was fanciful with children and biting and cynical with the adults. I would read more of her adult fiction, but I do hope for a lighter touch and a little humor from her in the future."
3,"This is the third Jack Reacher novel I've read, but I've been jumping around in the chronology. I believe I've read the first, and then this and one other, which I believe are both fairly recent. I suppose I could look that up, but it's not all that important. But my point was that I was a little surprised by the characterization of Jack Reacher in this one. 
 Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the recent changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement. You can read why I came to this decision here. 
 In the meantime, you can read the entire review at Smorgasbook"
5,"I find sometimes British humour just hits me in the right spot. This is one of those times. An interesting, mostly unexplained world of post-humans designed to react to certain colors, and other implied traits like easy repair and indefinite longevity. It is a Utopia for people who like to follow the rules. Which of course does not describe the main characters, who are Questioning Authority. All the rebels and misfits are shunted off to the edge of society, while the center revels in and protects its stasis. There's no heroism here, but self-interest and getting by and romance take it's place in driving the plot. Be aware, this is the beginning of a series/trilogy, completely unrelated to his previous works."
2,"I wanted to love this book but I couldn't. It had such a great idea, but the execution is so bad. 
 Even as I reached to the end of the book I'd read paragraphs and half way I realize she's remembering things from her past. The main character is someone I could not like either. 
 ""I feel, for the first time, their true power."" 1984 much?"
4,"Fascinating. The subject is deep. Anybody interested in art would find it a rewarding read. Told through the format of comic books. I'm going to check out his Zot reprint next to see how he uses his theories. He's got some comics online as well, which are somewhat experimental. Check out the status updates I did for this book.

 Catty girls fighting over guys, yay! I have to say I was hoping for more Victorian chills. None of the characters were likable. Some people say the ending was predictable, but it surprised me. Overall, it was disappointing and the writing wasn't too good."
4,"And you thought your life was complicated. 
 It is a shame this series was canceled before it could properly come around full circle. The first volume was stellar & then the middle two volumes were definitely slow to form the story. I do think with the pacing issues, it would have been dragged out over a few more volumes. I am not sure how I would have felt about that. With this getting canceled & having to rush the storyline, it did make things pick up & get that much more exciting, in my opinion. However, it would have been nice to have had a story after everything happens. Obviously that wasn't meant to be. I did love all of the Lovecraftian influences in the ending -- the ending which I thought was apt to the story & really enjoyed. 
 I doubt I will ever read it again, considering I read the first volume in May of last year & didn't continue the story until now. But overall the series was charming & a quick, fun read!"
5,"Ahhh I needed. I mean NEEDED this romance. 
 I have struggled or I seem to have struggled with finding a good vamp romance, or a good shifter romance. Thank the high heavens, this was sent to me. 
 I very nearly didn't buy this because of my kindle price personal policy, anything over PS1 I struggle to justify sometimes. However for this, I am so so so glad I did. 
 Hes so sexy and she is so gorgeous and sexy. I like the underlying story of a mystery villian stealing their daughter away and then joining forces and rekindling their love while searching for their child. 
 So happy with this read!"
2,"I liked the first half, but then it took an unexpected and weird turn that I didn't enjoy."
4,"This book was as equally well written as Enclave. The problem with middle books is that they either feel rushed, leaving too many threads dangling, or they are poorly paced, stretching out the storyline which should have been in only two books in the first place. This is where Ann Aguirre has triumphed. Although this is a middle book, it has a plot that stands on its own two *metaphorical* feet, and the pacing is steady. 
 This book takes place entirely above ground, which made me a little sad. I miss the excitement and terror of the tunnels. I also miss the Freaks from book one, their mindless attacking and feeding providing a sense of unpredictability. Now that the Freaks are adapting, they feel a little less scary to me, and I am too easily able to empathize with them. This leaves me feeling uneasy, which is also the sign of a great author. 
 Well done, overall. Now, how am I supposed to wait for the sequel??"
4,This story was okay. It had the common theme of a hero who doesn't want commitment and in this case he was even her secret opponent but the story picked up when she finally woke up and got assertive. Merry is hired to set up a historical museum town and hires construction worker Shane to renovate.
4,"I'm going to miss this series so much! I loved the conclusion to The Others and finding out how the Lakeside built a working community around humans and The Others. 
 The plot revolves around an enterprising evil human called Jimmy, who moves to Lakeside with his family in a mission to make some money. He causes endless trouble for the Lakeside community but the Elders want to observe how a troublemaker like him can impact a community. As an antagonist, Jimmy was disgusting to read about, almost unrealistically so. 
 It was interesting how this instalment explored emotional manipulation from a sibling and the power abuse that can happen as a result of being the adoptive child in the family. It was frustrating seeing Sierra consistently lie through her teeth and let herself be manipulated by Jimmy, and I wanted her to stand up for herself. 
 What was interesting was exploring how much Simon, Vlad, Tess and the rest of the Terra indigine acted around humans. From viewing them as a food source, to key pillars in their community, I loved how they came to together to protect their own. 
 Most of all, I loved how Simon has changed, particularly considering his unconventional feelings for Meg. He's still frustrated by female humans and confused by their behaviour, but will do anything to protect Meg from harm. 
 Meg has grown so much over the course of the series, and I'm glad she no longer resorts to cutting when she feels a vision coming on. She really displays her inner strength and power in this book and I loved seeing this happen. 
 I'll definitely miss this series with the Lakeside community. It couldn't have finished more perfectly."
3,"Like many others, I picked up this book because I enjoyed the television show. Well, let me warn you right off the bat: this is nothing like the television show. In fact, I like the television show more (and I'm still very sad that they cancelled it!). But don't let that turn you away from the book. It was a fascinating concept and a quick read (but okay, I skimmed most of the heavy science parts). 
 In April 2009, a physics experiment causes a worldwide temporal displacement: a ""flashforward"" during which the entire human race's consciousness shifts forward in time 21 years. The book deals mainly with the physicists Lloyd Simcoe and Theo Procopides and their responses to their visions (Simcoe finds he's married to someone other than his fiancee, and Theo finds out he's been murdered a few days before the day everyone saw), but Sawyer also jumps around and looks at the global effects of such an event as well as minor characters here and there. 
 I read through this book in 4-5 sittings. During the first two, I covered nearly 2/3 of the book. Then it slowed down, and I started to get bored with all the science explanations and the blatant ""telling"" instead of ""showing."" It asks some amazing philosophical questions. Everyone wonders about what their future is like, and if they had a chance to see it, how they would react. There's a lot of debates about free will and time and how it all fits together. 
 I found the characters a little flat. I was interested in their stories, but not past the point of, ""Hmm, I wonder what's going to happen."" Like 4 on a scale from 1 to 10. But it is what kept me reading, I wanted to know about Theo's killer and how Lloyd's marriage worked out. I also thought some of Sawyer's predictions about the future were a little contrived/far-fetched. Of course we have to have flying cars, but I don't think the institution of marriage will ever be reduced to merely living together for a certain amount of time. (And in all three books I've read of Sawyer's, he has to say something about how his Canadian/European characters can enjoy socialized healthcare while Americans can't. Yes, we know. No need to rub it in.) 
 All in all, I'd recommend this book, but not before others."
0,"I heard that it was a Harry Potter rip-off that portays the Arts as Awesome and Magical and generally utopian, while everything else (math, science) is Evil and Close-Minded and Brain-Washing and generally dystopian. Srsly, book? Srsly? In the future, there will be a huge increase in STEM jobs, so why in the world do we want to put this crap into our children's heads?"
4,"Seveneves is a good, not great Stephenson novel. 
 The scope is grand throughout (welcome after Reamde started strong, but lost its way). Sure, there are small things you can quibble with: as always, Stephenson's characterization could be stronger, colony politics was drawn more vividly in the Mars Trilogy, and so on. 
 However, the core of the book is a wonderful story of how humanity can survive, how it can push itself past unimaginable stress and pressure and how the world can go through apocalypse and renew itself. 
 Read it for that story."
3,"This exciting train adventure story has a vivid setting and a well-paced plot. My main problem was the too neat ending. Also, not including an author's note and additional resources is a huge missed opportunity."
1,"I had high hopes for this one, thought the premise sounded interesting, however it didn't work out for me. I am not sure why, it took me over an hour to read 25 pages, a long time for me. I found my mind wandering while I read, not a good sign. In the end, this one wasn't for me."
3,"TL;DR An NC-17 Dungeon Crawl. It's not perfect but it's worth a read. 
 I like reading new authors. Sure, the work can be unpolished, but sometimes a ""diamond in the rough"" is still a gem. Mark Smylie's Debut novel *is* rough but it was ultimately worth the effort. 
 Set in a harsh and brutal world, this novel is liberally laced with gratuitous sex and violence. It is not ""erotic"" or ""sensuous"" - it is graphic and explicit and vulgar at times (unapologetically so). If you do not like this in your literature, do not begin reading. 
 It very much reminded me of a Dungeons and Dragons campaign: a stock set of characters begins a quest for an epic piece of loot. The prologue is a wonderful take on the image the graces the old D&D Player's Handbook (a questing party looting a temple)- complete with a couple of characters removing the gems from the eyes of an idol. It was a great introduction to the main characters and it sets up the main story nicely. 
 There is some fantastic world building in this book. The only problem was that there are large blocks of exposition that slow down the pace of the plot and weighed down the dialogue. There was so much written about kingdoms, people, history, customs, and religion, that had nothing at all to do with the tale at hand. As a reader, I was never sure if the information dump was relevant. By the end of the story I realized that a good 25% of the words I read had nothing to do with the story or characters I was involved in.(Maybe these passages made much more sense to readers familiar with the comics/graphic novels (Artesia) that are set in the same world.) 
 The main protagonists are really interesting characters but, like player characters in a D&D campaign, they did not get ""fleshed out"". (It was very much like the characterizations that appear in a screenplay rather than a novel.) I really wanted to get to know Stjepan Black-Heart better and I hope that Smylie will write further adventures for him. Educated, he is an imperial cartographer by day / treasure hunting adventurer by night. He leads the party of adventurers on the quest to find an evil wizard's burial barrow and the legendary sword it is rumored to contain. His party consists of brothel owner Gilgwyr, insane mage Leigh, mercenary crew leader Godewyn Red-Hand, noble knight Arduin, his magical-map wearing sister Annwyn, and Erim, the woman-disguised-as-a-man swordsman. These are *good* characters, but, like players in an ensemble movie, they just felt flat. Smylie has also embraced the George RR Martin school of sacrificing characters for the cause. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it sure does make me less able to become emotionally invested in characters I like when I know absolutely no one is safe from a horrible death (or, kinky, perverted sex then a horrible death...or death, then kinky, perverted sex...lol). 
 There are a couple of flaws, in addition to the expository info-dumps, that also detract from the good, gritty story (and they are the reason I rated it a good book, not a great book). The most prevalent is that the language and sentences are often ""clunky"" with repeated words and phrases. Also, the flow of the action sequences can be confusing because of breaks that occur at odd places. There are quick-cuts between characters/scenes that make it hard to follow the individual story lines. I did find myself having to re-read passages in order to figure out what was going on. 
 In spite of the flaws, I read all 602 pages and still want to know what will happen next. That makes it a *good* book."
3,"I liked this book. It doesn't break any new ground, it's not as good as the originals, but it's not bad either. The plot creakily turns, but it's interesting. Not sure if translation issues, but I did find some of the dialogue slightly unrealistic--especially the American dialogue. Ed the Ned is such an awful handle, I had trouble taking that pretty important character seriously. Some of the characters seem somewhat carbon copies--Gabriella, Sofia, Alona--I think in the sense they're not fleshed out like the characters in the trilogy. 
 What ever happened to Monica by the way? She's not mentioned or referenced at all. 
 Other change is that it's a much more generic thriller--which again, I'm okay with because I like the characters enough that it would be a shame to end on just three books. Especially when you could tell that Larsson had so much more planned. This book it's the evil twin sister referenced in the first 3 but not shown and I thought her character was done well. I look forward to seeing the repercussions carry on to the next ones."
4,"Well-written and informative, thoroughly readable, with lots of interesting stories and information about the ecological catastrophe we have begun, and are now trying to mitigate."
4,"An interesting take on dystopian fiction, this unfolds more as a slice-of-life narrative (with multiple perspectives and timelines) before and after a flu pandemic wipes out --iirc -- 99% of the world's population. The 5 main characters are linked via Arthur, a thrice-wed, aging stage and screen star who is among the first to die, but the clear protagonist is Kirsten, a traveling actress in the post-plague world who doesn't remember its first year, but as a child was on stage with Arthur when he collapsed and has a few mysterious relics from that time. She and her compatriots encounter a menacing cult led by a creepy ""prophet"" who proclaims that the Georgia flu survivors are all Chosen people, after which members of the troupe begin to disappear. Despite these spooky circumstances, the text really shouldn't be considered ""horror,"" nor should its setting classify it as science fiction (though, congrats on winning the Arthur C. Clarke award!). The writing is lovely (I particularly liked the characters' reflections on a sci-fi/fantasy comic book written by Arthur's ex-wife and archived by Kirsten, with luminous imagery and parallels to the outer text) but mild - there is death, and killing to survive, but there's no gutshot here, and the one twist/reveal won't have you gripping your chair. In other words, this is not genre fiction, despite the setting. It's all very literary, and somehow tenderly exact, as if Mandel is documenting a true story for future survivors of the apocalypse that could come, we are reminded, at any time."
5,"On the 19th of april I met my new best friend. Her name is Elizabeth Bennet and she is more witty and sociable than I will ever be, and I love her for that. 
 As I walked into Waterstones and saw those beautiful Penguin covers, I knew I couldn't push Jane Austen's famous novel away any longer. It was time to open up this well known English classic and see for myself what the buzz is about, and after finishing it today, I can tell you that the praise for this story is well deserved. Jane Austen wrote in 1796 an universal story about proper English middle-class women who all are looking, in different ways, for a man to marry, and wrote about those old-fashioned women in such a 'modern' way that every reader can easily identify with one of them. 
 The main character of this novel is Elizabeth Bennet, a young lady of twenty-one who lives with four sisters, her silly and oversensitive mother and calm father, in a nice, simple country-town, which gets shaken by the arrival of young, rich Mr. Bingley and an well-dressed army unit of young soldiers. This sends Mrs. Bennet, the oldest Bennet sister Jane, and the youngest sisters in a frenzy, but Elizabeth is affected by neither, until she meets Mr. Darcy. 
 He is the best friend of Mr. Bingley, but they are as different as day and night. Where Mr. Bingley is a 'Prince Charming' come alive (seriously, that man has no flaws), Fitzwilliam Darcy (I laughed so hard at his first name) is the human equivalent of an ugly, antique table piece that you want to throw away, but since it's going to pay for your old day, you're stuck with it. 
 So yes, I really felt for Elizabeth when I read how prideful Mr. Darcy had his heart set out on her. Their rocky relationship, which of course later changes and blooms, was a nice contrast to that of Jane and Mr. Bingley, who immediately hit it off, but keep tiptoeing around each other. Oh, it would have been easier if Jane, and many other characters in this book, had read Shakespeare. 
 A heart to love, and in that heart, Courage, to make's love known. (Macbeth, Act 2, Scene 3) 
 Because true, a lot of confusion and problems could have been resolved by people having the courage to be open and honest about their feelings, but this novel takes place in the 18th century, where even hands-touching was something to gossip about. Therefore, I got never irritated by the subtle talks, vague insults, and flowery statements (of love). 
 However, I do am glad that I read this book now when I'm older and more familiar with the old-english writing style, or otherwise reading this novel would be a serious pain. This book is, if you're going to read it in English, not for the new or inexperienced reader, so take caution with that. 
 But as mentioned earlier, this book is about women and about sisterhood; because when it comes down to finding the right man to marry, all the girls in this story need support from their friends and family. Jane and Elizabeth are lovely together: one is soft-spoken but rational while the other one is bold but more vain, and how they find strenght in each other is sweet and very touching. 
 The friendship between Charlotte and Elizabeth is one that deserve a mention also. With the arrival and the proposal of Mr. Collins, Elizabeth's cousin, the two best friends break apart when one of the girls rejects him, while the other one accepts. (view spoiler)[ This acception, and its consequences, anger Elizabeth, but we as reader can't really pick a right/wrong-side here. Charlotte is justified in wanting to marry, but we know, just as Elizabeth, that Mr. Collins is the dullest man alive. If Charlotte is ever going to be truely happy, is to be seen. (hide spoiler)] The conflict of ""following society's expections and be satified with your (unhappy) marriage Vs. rejecting those expections but ending up disgraced and alone"" is portrayed fantastically by these girls. 
 Lydia, the youngest sister, could have done with a hesitant companion such as Jane. The girl, selfish and silly like her mother, becomes more arrogant as the story continues until it explodes in Volume Three. At many times I wanted to cry out in frustration, because Lydia is the old-fashioned version of 
 Good Girl Gone Bad 
 while on Spring Break. At the end of the novel she apparantly hasn't learned her lessions, but that is perfect to me: Lydia and her husband get what they deserve. 
 [Lydia] ""And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over."" 
 ""I thank you for my share in the favour,"" said Elizabeth; ""but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands."" 
 (One of the best examples of Elizabeth's sass, a.k.a. Get wrecked Lydia) 
 But above all the sister- and marriage-drama, the most engaging part of this story is how slowly Fitzwilliam Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet fall in love. He learns to let go of his pride and strict mind, and she lets go of her preconceived opinions, and thanks to an important letter ( Oh, that Letter! *is still shocked* ) gets to see Mr. Darcy for who he really is. (view spoiler)[ Not only that, but she is even willing to fight for him, as her awesome showdown with Lady Catherine showed. (hide spoiler)] Their love story is one that will stay with me for a long time. 
 So five stars for this Jane Austen's novel, and I hope to read more of her work in the future. Already I can hear Waterstones calling my name, so expect more English-romance novels coming up soon."
3,"This was a weird book for me. I wasn't too into it in the beginning, got to a point where I couldn't stand Elisa, and then a funny thing happened: the book redeemed itself. More complete review to come. 
 Full review: 
 Talk about your mixed bag. This book was that in spades, and then some. It's rare that I start out disliking a book and continuing to read it in spite of that, only to end up liking things about it. Usually, it's the other way around for me. It's unfortunate that it did get off to such a weak start and that there were so many problematic elements to it, because I might otherwise have really enjoyed it. As it was, it was a decent reading experience, but not one that got me overly excited. Ahead be spoilers. 
 A big reason why I (and many others, it seems) wanted to read this book is because it was billed as diverse, owing to its featuring a main character who is very overweight. You know up front that she is, because it's mentioned multiple times. Elisa thinks it, other characters say it, and it's generally discussed on almost every page in the book. There is such a thing as driving the point home with a *bit* too much force. That said, it was interesting to see an author delve into a character's unhealthy body image and obsession with food. Yeah, I did get tired of reading about all the lamb dishes after a while, but it also made sense to me. Elisa's relationship with sustenance is very, very disordered, so it makes sense that it's on her mind a lot. She has an emotional relationship with food, turning to it in times of stress when she needs comfort, and the book is very clear on that point. 
 What bugged me about Elisa, though, was that she never stops to think about her unhealthy relationship with food. She is such a sad sack for such a huge portion of the novel that I couldn't stand her. I understood where she was coming from and why she felt the way she did, but since she didn't do much more than wallow in self-pity, I had a hard time empathizing with her. I wanted her to wonder why she's so attached to food, why she thinks so poorly about herself, and why she can't do something to change that. She gets there, but it takes a lot of outside events, and I thought that was kind of a letdown. For how introspective the girl can be, she doesn't spend much time wondering about her own destructive tendencies, and that's a shame. I wanted her to have a moment where she realized she was more than her body, that her inner worth counted for a lot more, but she never gets to that point without a LOT of outside validation. Really, I guess this boils down to a personal preference, that this is just the sort of person she is, but nevertheless I found it disappointing. 
 I didn't much like the godstones. They were way, way too deus ex machina for me. This is a huge flaw of the ""chosen one"" trope. The ""chosen one"" is a crutch because the character never really has to struggle or grow or learn, they just need to tap into their special ""chosen one"" powers at the right moment. It's possible to use this trope in an effective way. Harry Potter is a good example, but I'd argue that Rowling subverts the trope because, really, it's not so much that Potter is the ""chosen one"" as it is that he becomes the ""chosen one"" as a result of his enemy's paranoia. Harry doesn't have awesome special powers and he can't get by without help from his friends. Elisa, on the other hand, taps right into her uber power at the right moment, and the world is saved. Honestly, that bores me. I was a lot more interested in what she did with the Malificio, which was far more engrossing for me. Any way you look at it, though, it didn't much matter what Elisa did because what really wins the day is that special super power, a power that makes Elisa incidental. She's special only because of what she has in her belly, not because of her heart or her mind or anything else that makes a character compelling. It's a shame, because once her heart and mind start expanding, she becomes more interesting. 
 I also don't like that everything that inconveniences her is disposed of in the end, often in pointless ways that bleed the events of any impact, and always without her having to lift a finger. Inconvenient husband? Gone. (And don't get me started on their unconsummated marriage. It's utter nonsense. When a marriage is a way to cement a royal alliance, it's consummated. Period, full stop. YA fantasy, you need to stop giving your characters an out when this happens. Either have them consummate the relationship, or drop this plot device altogether.) Annoying, duplicitous, beautiful countess who harasses Elisa? Gone. Evil animagi who threaten to destroy the heroine's homeland? Gone--at least in the immediate vicinity. What happens to Humberto also feels pointless to me, a means of manipulating the reader's emotions and upping the angst for Elisa. It's not even important that he thinks he has a way to get her out of her marriage, because that obstacle is removed in the end anyway. 
 So what do I like about this book? Well, I like that the heroine is introspective, bookish, and introverted. Quiet characters are fairly rare in YA, and they're also rarely the center of the action. I like Elisa's struggle to find her place in the world, to do what's demanded of her because she understands that it's her responsibility. Sure, she sometimes wishes she could just go hide in her room, but she's mature enough to accept that she can't. And for as unwilling as she is to be an active part of her own life, she does react when she's called to do it, as in the fight with the Perditos. It was so refreshing to see a character react like that rather than waiting for someone to save her. It gave me hope that she could rise above her (mostly self-imposed) limitations and become something more. 
 I like that her looks are unconventional. While I wasn't fond of the fact that she gains a lot of her confidence after losing some weight, the book is also clear that she's not exactly supermodel slim either. In some ways, her evolving body type is a reflection of her evolving character, and even though she looks different, who she is on the inside hasn't changed much. Elisa is still the same Elisa, just in different packaging, and I think that's a good thing. And while I thought the body image issues were a bit mixed, I wanted to cheer at the way some characters react to it. Sure, some are big jerks who can't look past Elisa's weight, but some see her for who she is and respect, admire, and even love her *for* it, not *despite* it. Hector's and Humberto's nonchalance about Elisa's appearance is significant because it's true. The world often appears to be a very superficial place, but there are always those who eschew the superficiality because they're more concerned about substance. Guess which characters I liked most in the book? 
 The other thing that I thought was so well done about this book is the way it examines its religious context. Sometimes this does feel rather like Christian fiction, but there is nuance here. Elisa's godstone indicates to her and everyone who shares her belief system that her actions are the results of God's will. Yet she reaches a point where she looks at her belief system through new eyes and sees that it's kind of warped. She's spent her life believing in a truth and yet has the intellectual capacity to recognize when her truth doesn't gibe with other people's truth. More, she's able to see that maybe, just maybe, the Invierne also think they're acting out of God's will, even though other characters in the book have a hard time giving this idea credit. I feel like there's a lot under the surface here, and I'd guess that the other books probably develop this nuanced version more. I guess I'll find out if I do decide to read the others. 
 Whether or not I will remains a question because, while this book does some things really wrong and others really right, I'm not sure it was compelling enough for me to continue with the series."
4,"This book felt risky when I picked it up. Steampunk AND zombies? Seems like working with a lot. I was skeptical. But I can happily say that Priest has pulled it off shockingly well. 
 The beginning is very strong and I felt hooked rather quickly. It progresses fairly well and has some good suspenseful moments. All the steampunk aspects were fun, if a little over the top at times. While the zombies themselves seemed almost unnecessary they added a nice sense of constant danger. 
 I'm excited to read the rest in the series."
1,Couldn't do it. Just didn't interest me enough. I really need to stop reading/trying to read books that don't interest me. Life's too short.
4,"**okay - i have actually written a ""review"" for this book, all you early bird voters! feel free to take back your picture-votes if you hate my words (and by ""feel free,"" i mean ""don't you dare!!"")** 
 why have i never read this book before?? 
 observe: 
 do you see how it is wedged into a teetering, lode-bearing stack of books?? 
 removing it was a tricky business, indeed, but i succeeded, and i am finally reading it. so thank you for badgering me about it, internet, because so far, i am really enjoying it!!! 
 *****************************REVIEW*********************************** 
 the other day, when i was still a whopping 60 pages from finishing this book, greg shoved me out from in front of my work-computer to revisit his review of the book.he muttered aloud ""why does anyone even read my reviews. karen, don't ever let me compare a book to a mobius strip again."" 
 and he is both correct and incorrect. because it is a good review, but the book ain't nothing like a mobius strip. 
 finnegan's wake is a true mobius. infinite jest is a motheaten mobius, with key scenes lost along the way. this is more of a parabola, or the first hill in a rolly coaster. if the rolly-coaster ride-as descriptor weren't so trite, i would explore that here: how at first, you didn't quite know what you were getting into, as you made your ascent, but then, once you got to the top and could see what was coming, you just couldn't read through it quickly enough, and there was excitement and screams and probably some of the weaker readers vomited into their laps. but it is indeed trite, so i won't make the comparison at all. 
 i can understand the accusations of gimmickry. although as we are learning here on goodreads, gimmicks pay off, no? even the ones with no substance. and if this was just structure without substance, i would completely agree with mitchell's detractors. if it were just a series of short stories, butterflied and stacked on top of each other to form a book, it would be less appealing than it is in reality. 
 because they do bounce off of each other, the stories. they sneak into each others' worlds both thematically, and more overtly, like foraging little mice on mouse-missions. sometimes they are each others' stories. calvino, borges, arabian nights, david lynch - i can trot out all the expected names if you aren't tired of reading them.but this is something all its own. and i am sure that a second reading would do me a world of good at identifying even more of these echoes. this is a book that pretty much demands a second pass, which i will gladly give. 
 mitchell addresses the accusations of gimmickry before they are even made, in the novel itself: 
 spent the fortnight gone in the music room, reworking my year's fragments into a ""sextet for overlapping soloists"": piano, clarinet, 'cello, flute, oboe, and violin, each in its own language of key, scale, and color. in the first set, each solo is interrupted by its successor: in the second, each interruption is recontinued, in order. revolutionary or gimmicky? shan't know until it's finished, and by then it'll be too late. 
 and i love that - his anticipation of his own critics. yummy. 
 so - yeah - absolutely read this book if you have been dragging your feet over it. but beware - some of the stories are going to be much more captivating than others. i would read an entire book about frobisher, for example. 
 people are obscenities. would rather be music than be a mass of tubes squeezing semisolids around itself for a few decades before becoming so dribblesome it'll no longer function. 
 agreed. 
 i will definitely read this book again."
3,"I remember when I first read this book, after reading the series of Weather Warden I wanted to know more, and see more done by this author which made me fall in love with the story and residents of Morganville. 
 In the first installment of the series, we meet Claire, as well as some other characters as they move in together, grow and discover the secrets about the vampire residents."

 ""I don't know what it is that you're trying to do, but you and I are not the same."" 
 What I loved about this book: 
 Great office romance/love-turns-to-hate story 
 100% steam factor 
 Great characters (and a very tough heroine, too!) 
 What I felt needed improvement: 
 The storyline towards the end of the book stalls, then gets confusing, and finally builds up only to disappoint 
 Hero is one of the 2015 releases I was eagerly waiting for. I am a huge fan of Samantha Young's 
 On Dublin Street Series 
 and couldn't wait to read this standalone that would promise a more corporate environment. And by corporate, I mean a great hate turns-to-love relationship mixed with some hot office romance (and the much expected quality steamy scenes). So in that instance, 
 Hero 
 did not disappoint! 
 As is the case with most (all?) Samantha Young books, 
 Hero 
 was written in 1st Person, from Lexie's POV, which is perfect so you get to experience the full extent of Caine brooding handsomeness (even though I would have welcomed being in his head for a chapter or two). 
 I really enjoyed the characters too, especially Lexie, who was not your usual naive heroine, but an actual tough-cookie demonstrating a great deal of patience, profesionnalism and perseverance toward the jerk that's made it his mission to make her pay for things she didn't do, and thus make her life a living hell (yes, we're talking about Caine here). 
 [spoiler]And still, Caine and Lexie engange into a purely sexual relationship. Caine never fails to let Lexie know that he can never be more - never be her knight in shining armor.[/spoiler] 
 Now Caine is special. As in: peculiar. Yes, he's hot, and well... he gets cold just as quickly. That can sometimes be a bit annoying, but it's all part of the deal (and of the ""secret"" he's hiding...). It annoyed me that he was nice to Lexie in one moment, then rude the next. Lexie kept getting her hopes up thining there could be ""more"", only to have them crushed. It annoyed me that she became a bit naive because of that. And don't quet me started on the jealousy bits coming from both ends. But hey, most of the time, it's a lot of playful banter and some build-up that's definitely akin to foreplay. 
 I also loved the side-characters, mainly Caine's ex-broadway-star neighbor Effie and his friend and business partner Henry who loves getting a rise out of him. I wonder if we'll get a sequel on Henry, the hopeless manwh-re who'd struggling to find the one. 
 As far as the storyline is concerned, it was great for the first part of the book, with an entertaining love-turn-to-hate/office-romance plot. But after that, a more suspenseful storyline takes over, where to focus is set on Alexa's family. I liked the idea of it, but the execution wasn't too great: the whole family feud was difficult to follow up with (I found it very confusing), until it came to a total stale and then launched back into a moment of suspense, albeit very shortlived. And I was also really dying to know about Caine's ""secret"" - the anticipation here was great, but once it was unveiled, I felt like saying ""So that's it?"" 
 So all in all I would give 
 Hero 
 a solid 4 Star rating since the characters, the writing and all the feels are there, but maybe the storyline needed a bit more work when it launched from office romance into romantic suspense, since all felt quite rushed.

0,"Throne of Glass is everything YA should be. Wonderfully written with engaging characters and enough mystery and intrigue to keep you guessing while the pages fly by. Add a couple handsome heros to keep things interesting and several mysterious murders and you have some fine reading here. 
 Adarlan is a realm under the thumb of a tyrant bent on world domination. Celaena Sardothien is a master assassin or at least she was -until she was betrayed. Now she spends her days swinging a pick ax (hard labor) and nights avoiding an early death (you just don't meet decent people in prison) Few people last long, she has made it a year. Holding on by sheer force of will, but for how much longer? 
 When she is given the opportunity to earn her freedom. (by competing for the right to become the King's champion) she takes that chance. Even tho it means working for the man she and most of the realm hates. She'll do anything to earn her freedom. I know, I know - Lame premise but this is youth orientated fantasy here. Just go with it - it works. 
 It's a good thing Celaena is tough. She'll need every bit of her strength. Not to win the competion she figures she has that in the bag. No Her biggest challenge will be staying alive long enough to make it to the final round because Court politics are a Killer and something is killing the challengers off."

 I'm not sure how I feel about this book. On the very superficial side, it has an awesome cover. ALSO, ANGELS. But... it doesn't really explain ANYTHING of interest. We discover all these mildly intriguing people who are suddenly angels, and yet all we get is a couple sentences about wings, and that's it? I mean, when I'm promised angels, I better get ANGELIC POWERS. Or at least proper backstory. I get that this is the beginning to a series, but come onnn. It reads like the middle of a series in the way that it tells you NOTHING. Bleh. But... goregous cover."

4,"***I received this book for free from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review, which was first posted on book blog Will Read for Feels. 
 After reading Lenora Bell's debut Regency romance and the first book in the Disgraceful Dukes series, How the Duke Was Won, I was so keen to read the next book I barely stopped to have a drink of water before diving in. I ended up reading both books in the span of a morning, and I've been looking forward to getting the opportunity to talk about If I Only Had a Duke, which will be released on Tuesday, August 30, 2016. 
 If you read the first book, you'll be pleased to learn that the heroine of If I Only Had a Duke is the real Lady Dorothea. You may have formed a few opinions about her, based on what we learned in book 1, but from the very first chapter, it's clear that however she appears to others, it doesn't encapsulate who she is. She's got a mind of her own, and while something of a social disaster, you find this is either a trait she's developed from the start or simply capitalized on when she realized the freedom it offered her. 
 Thea's philosophical attitude toward society and the life her family expects her to lead clashes beautifully with her genuine passion about art, her intrinsically good and caring nature, and her stubborn resolve to hold on to her dreams and her freedom. And all I have to say is, good on her! Moreover, the way Dalton smashes through her well-laid plans to go gently into that good spinsterhood and does the unthinkable by making her popular is a delight because of her wholehearted frustration with him. 
 Dalton, for his part, flouts society much the way Batman does, by playing the debauched playboy in the evenings and a Robin Hood-type vigilante with a secret mission of justice and/or vengeance in darkest night. He's driven by the trauma of his childhood, but the way Thea teaches him to look to and protect his future, all the while pissing him off like he were a cat she'd thrown into cold water--that's just fun, fun, fun. 
 The interplay between the two characters makes this book a must-read for me; it's full of biting wit punctuated by bubbling chemistry, and it's definitely a winning combination, even though the twist to the mystery was something I'd half predicted long before it was revealed. 
 I'm happy Lenora Bell has lived up to the promise she showed with her first book in this sophomore release. I still can't believe this is her first series, because she writes with a flourish I'd associate with a more veteran author. The only thing I'm sad about is the fact I have to wait until next summer to read book 3!"

4,"Overall- WOW. I dont even know what to think. Im still processing. This book took me by surprise. After reading the synopsis I was hooked. I had to read this book. At about 10% I was intrigued but a little confused as to where the story was going. At 30% I was getting involved but still a little skeptic. By 50% I was HOOKED. No way did I see these curveballs. I am so impressed by the authors imagination and ability to put this down on paper, creating such a great world and amazing characters. This book reminds me a little of Grasping at Eternity, and a little of the butterfly effect. And if you like the Unraveling, this has that aspect to it as well. 
 Ill be honest though, there is a great deal of world and character building through the first half of the book, and very little science fiction. HOWEVER, stick it out! You will not be disappointed. This is one of those books, where after Ive read it, and know the ending, I want to re-read it, so I can see all the hints the author has magnificently crafted and placed throughout the novel, unbeknownst to the reader until everything comes together in the end. This story was not only beautifully written but woven together with great care and imagination. Surely will stay with me for a while!

 I have no idea why this review was such a challenge for me. I loved the book, which means it should be easy to rave about. 
 Things I liked: 
 Let me state the obvious. 
 Janelle and Ben! They were just the absolute cutest! 
 He was just so sweet, and quiet and plain ol adorable. 
 How could Janelle have completely over looked Ben for 7 YEARS!!! 
 I never imagined I'd enjoy a book about impending doom so much. Our Earth is going to cease to exist unless a 17 year old playing junior FBI and her band of misfits can stop it. While it bordered that fine line of too over the top, it built up the suspension in a way that made me desperate to find out how they can accomplish the impossible. 
 Let me just point out, Janelle is crazy strong. She is the opposite of the weak female heroine who complains and plays too much damsel in distress. She's about action. Doing all she can to protect her family. 
 Things I didn't like: 
 She didn't seem to care too much about her mother. Through her words and actions she shows love for every other person in her life. She seemed to resent her mother. A liability and responsibility she would rather not have. An annoyance. I have no problem with her resenting her mother. That is almost an expected side effect of the bi-polar disorder. Janelle just didn't care. I dont even know what happened to her at the end of the book??? (Maybe I was so excited about the rest I skipped a paragraph) 
 That was my only downfall. I loved the relationship and interactions between her and Ben so much. It could have been more. :) I wouldn't complain. 
 I will definitely be reading Unbreakable, because I just have to know...

3,"Well, Beauty From Pain absolutely blew me away and I fell hard for Jack Henry. I was completely desperate to get my hands on the sequel after that cliffhanger. I was fully invested in these two and really needed them to find the happiness that they both deserve together. 
 This one picks up pretty much where we left them - separated by several thousand miles and the Pacific Ocean. Laurelyn has returned to America and Jack has absolutely no idea how to find her. After a disastrous and eye-opening attempt to find number fourteen, Jack hires a private detective to track Laurelyn down. She has attempted to move on with her life despite her incredible sense of loss after walking away from Jack and Australia. 
 I did enjoy that we got a longer story with these two and an ultimately very happy ending after a period of strife but, in retrospect, I think this may have been better told in just one book. I did really enjoy Jack's POV in this one and hearing how he was feeling about their situation but I just didn't love this one as much as the first, sadly. 
 Laurelyn was still a great heroine and I still really loved her. She remains open, engaging, rather sad but ultimately hopeful. She's attempting to move on with her life, finding happiness in her singing and is considering starting a relationship with one of her band members who is more than a little interested in her. I felt deeply her incredible sadness at the loss of the love of her life and worried about her situation with her mother and father and her horrific ex-boyfriend. 
 Jack for me was just not the guy I fell in love with in Beauty From Pain - he seems to be a whole lot less alpha. He's still very endearing and very sexy but there was just something here that made him seem a bit feeble compared to how I'd seen him before. He comes across as a broken man rather than as an alpha roaring for his mate. Also, Laurelyn and Jack just seemed to be lacking that fizzing connection and amazing chemistry that I'd been so blown away by in the first book. The sex scenes, although still very hot, did rather lack that intensity that I'd enjoyed before. I'm not also sure we got full closure on some of the backstories - Laurelynn's relationship with her father, what happened to her ex in the end and what about Audrey? 
 But still, I believe that they got their Happy Ever After that they truly deserve and there's a beautiful epilogue and there's still a lot to enjoy in this one. If you loved Beauty From Pain, and so many of us did, this is a must-read to get that sense of completion that we all crave.

4,"From the book's blurb and title I thought this would be about scam artist Victor who faked choking in restaurants, but that is barely a subplot to what becomes an in depth character study of a fairly complex sex addict. Each chapter peels away another layer of what seems at the surface to be a dismissive unsavory human being. I enjoyed the creative opening chapter which warns readers that we will not like this person--going as far as calling the character several untoward names--in the third person and then follows as a first person narrative by that same person. It is a very unique and fitting way to start this book out. 
 As it turns out, Victor's scam has a Robin Hoodish motive of sorts using his choking scam to help finance his $3,000 a month bill for his dying mother's care. We follow Victor's bizarre journey of personal self-discovery and worth. Who really is Victor Mancini? 
 Warning to prospective readers: this is not a story-laden book with action and plot twists. It is extremely slow in that regard until the final few chapters where there are some unexpected, almost shocking, turns. Again, from the blurb I thought maybe we'd learn what sort of trouble Victor would get into with his choking scam, but that isn't the direction that Chuck Palahniuk takes this story at all. There is a lot of discussion about what it means and is like to be a sex addict, using that as a springboard to slice and dice inner demons. In the end, I found myself appreciating the dimensions of Victor and while he never became likable, he became tolerable and (scary, I know) almost understandable. This is a rare book from a very talented writer pulling off an almost impossible feat with a reader. The opening chapter warning turns out to be immensely prophetic. 
 I couldn't sustain interest in reading a book like this very often, but I guess it came along at the right time because I thoroughly enjoyed how different it was from plot-driven stories that I typically require reading to hold my interest. If you enjoy thick, heavy satire and can tolerate a cynical narrator opining and describing the lives a cast of mostly unlikable and/or depressing characters (seemingly hopeless, nonredeemable addicts and patients with severe mental disabilities), give Choke a try."

3,"Told from multiple perspectives this story explores how rumors and truth can become twisted, and the damage they can do. This is one of those books that make you think. Everyone has their own versions of what really happened and who Alice really is. Everyone has their own agenda and things to hide. This book shows how twisted the truth can really become. I loved how you get to know the secrets everyone is keeping and how those secrets taint the each character's version of the truth."
2,"Egads, more of the same. I cared less about Cress and the struggling fledgling romance with Thorne than I did about Scarlet and Wolf. But I slogged through once again for Cinder and Kai. Sad that imaginary characters can't applaud my effort. Sad about the Doc though but I get it he had to go. Always interesting to see how the author handles the fairy tale elements and yup that's it. Now to read Winter and finish my journey."
3,"I would have adored this book if it had been written for a slightly older audience. Some YA books appeal to both the target and more mature audiences, but this one feels a little watered down. Which makes sense, because it's a book about brainwashed, traumatized, very violent assassins. I mean if Stohl hadn't softened the action scenes it wouldn't have sold to the younger Marvel fans. 
 Anyway, looking at it from that angle, it's a fun book. It gives us a look at an oft-overlooked Avenger, and it introduces teens for the target readers to relate to. The plot is interesting and comic book-y, which is praise if you're a comics fan. 
 Even though it felt lukewarm to me because of the age gap I would still pick up any future Black Widow novels. Seriously. I would prepay and everything."

 Hot, quick read! 
 This book is a fast-paced road to la-la land! 
 I like the attitude of both characters-not just about having a baby, but with their outlook in life. It was fun reading about how both of them squirm when the other is around. ;) Even though I already know where the story was headed, I enjoyed their interactions and light banters. 
 I admit, everything went too fast that at some point, I felt left behind wanting more details. Anyway, since this is a short read, I guess it was intended to be that way. 
 Still a good read. Wish it was longer. :)"

 I absolutely adore everything about this short series. Girl Friends is a sweet lovely story of two girls who start as friends but slowly discover what they feel is more than friendship. 
 Outgoing Akko has been eying shy bookish Maki eat lunch alone all semester and when she makes an offer of friendship Maki is a little surprised but happy. Akko helps Maki transform from a wallflower into a cutie and before long the two girls are best friends. As time passes and Maki finds her feelings for Akko changing and growing, it's so sweetly handled. She get's jealous when she thinks about Akko's past boyfriends and feels sad when they're apart, just like when you first begin to fall in love. 
 When they finally come together it's magic-it feels right. A young love full of yearning, tenderness, uncertainty, it's all so new and fragile. How can your heart not race when Akko makes her declaration of love to Maki?

 It needs to be said that this story is not for everyone as it has adult themes and a same sex relationship but if you are looking for something salacious you will not find it here. There are some sexual scenes but they are lovingly and beautifully done.

 There was so much to love about this series-from the art to the sweet and tender story. I will be saving my pennies to purchase copies for my own personal library and that's saying something because I buy very few manga and this series is a keeper!

4,"I enjoyed the direction this book took for several reasons. First, Breq is captain of a sentient Ship...but it's not the same as actually BEING the Ship, and it's interesting to watch her navigate that distinction. I also liked the sense of dislocation from the rest of the universe - Breq (and everyone else) are cut off from the rest of the universe, and have very little idea what is going on elsewhere, leaving everyone trying to figure out what are purely local concerns and what are echoes of the larger power struggle. The book also added more depth to the questions raised in the previous installment about how a large, colonial empire really works, and for whom it works. Some citizens are definitely more equal than others."

 Although not listed as such on this site, Again the Magic is a prequel to the wonderful Wallflowers series, which I really enjoyed and recommend. Unfortunately, I wasn't aware of the connection when I started the Wallflowers series, and I think this book may have suffered a little unnecessarily as a result. 
 Marcus, Lord Westcliff, the hero of It Happened One Autumn and featured in the other Wallflowers books, was my favourite hero of that series; and given that every Kleypas hero is a winner, that is no faint praise. 
 I was really excited to read Again the Magic, knowing that it was about Westcliff's sisters, and therefore would mean spending some more time in Marcus' company. Unfortunately, because of the attraction and connection I had already made to his character, I was a little disappointed in him this time around. That is no fault of the author - had I not already experienced him in all his glory, I would have thought nothing less of it. This is why I always read books in order, the way the author intended. 
 Aline Marsden, along with her older brother Marcus and younger sister Livia, was brought up in a household sorely lacking in love and affection. In her younger years, she had forged a close and unique relationship with McKenna, a servant on the estate. 
 Despite having no consideration or care for his daughter past the expectation that she will make an advantageous marriage, when Aline's intimidating and forbidding father finds out about their friendship, Aline is forced to send McKenna away, breaking both their hearts in the process. 
 When Aline and McKenna meet again many years later, both are changed in dramatic ways, and their once innocent love has turned bitter over time. McKenna is no longer of the servant class, having made his fortune in America, while Aline has suffered a great trauma that has left her feeling unworthy. Quite the role reversal. 
 Like many readers, I was frustrated with Aline. In other circumstances, I could understand her feelings and empathise with her behaviour, but in the face of such strong, enduring love, her actions were insulting to both of them and bordering on unforgivable. I guess that means the author did a great job in portraying the depth of their love, but it also rendered Aline's actions as unnecessary and incomprehensible - to the point that it cost the book a full star. 
 Unlike other readers, I didn't have a problem with the secondary romance involving youngest sister Livia and I enjoyed her scenes with Gideon without feeling that they detracted at all from Aline and McKenna's storyline. That said, I was a little surprised that the epilogue belonged exclusively to them and I do agree that they could have filled their own novel, but I still felt satisfied with what we got. 
 As with all Kleypas books, this one was well-written, full of emotion and eminently 'readable'. The hero, although having less than honourable intentions at times, was wonderful and deserved better than he got with Aline. Yes, I am still mad at her, which goes to show just how strongly the author draws you into her stories."

 The last volume in the trilogy. 
 One of Atwood's gifts in speculative fiction, or social science fiction, or whatever you want to call it, is taking a negative trend and extrapolating it out to its most plausible yet terrifying extreme. This was the case in The Handmaid's Tale with political and religious misogyny, and for Oryx and Crake with pollution and rudderless use of biotechnology. 
 Here is something that started off a bit more distant than that. Some of the surviving characters from the second book in the trilogy seem oddly flat in their world of survival. They seem static, distant, and disaffected (although maybe that's the effect of reading it immediately after Middlemarch?), and their backstories and flashbacks seem a bit dry. Long stretches of the middle were a bit unsatisfying. 
 However, the end was a bit more sensitive and tender, and it provided something like a sense of hope and closure in this new world. It is a good tragedy, and the end of the world comes with music and flowers. 
 Let us sing. Thank you. Good night."
3,"I'd been hearing so much about these books that I had to read at least one of them. Well, I'll probably be reading more than one, but not immediately. I did like the book. Sookie is a great character, and I liked her a lot. However, it really could have used a good editor, to catch all the stupid little grammar and stylistic mistakes that annoyed me so much. It definitely felt like an early book. I'm sure they'll improve as I go."
5,"Unbelievable how oblivious they were at that time about something that is more than known and common nowadays. Even though they portray Lili as someone girly and delicate, even fragile, you must have an enormous will and an unbreakable courage to do what Einar did, especially in those days."

 The Art of Lainey was so original! Using a classic book such as: The Art of War to win over your ex seems pretty... out there. However I loved seeing Lainey and her best friend Bianca going over the book and creating strategies to win over Lainey's ex; it was quirky and fun. 
 At first I thought I would hate this book because I couldn't really believe Lainey. Her boyfriend dumps her in a very mean and callous way, and she wants to win him back? Why? Because her life was perfect with him in it? But then, thanks to Lainey's awesome best friend, her parents, and Micah... well Lainey learned to grow throughout the novel. 
 Speaking of, I was so impressed with the way the female friendship was in this book! Bianca was so supportive of Lainey, however she wasn't afraid of telling her if she thought Lainey was wrong. 
 [Lainey] ""I don't even know who I would be without him."" 
 ""You would be my amazing friend, Lainey,"" Bee says. 
 She had an amazing relationship with her parents, too. Her mom was always so honest with Lainey and always gave her great advice. She even made me laugh sometimes when she came up with quirky ways to give Lainey advice. Even Lainey's brother, who wasn't even physically present in the book, was so supportive for her via emails and texts. 
 What made this romance so fun to read was the fact that Micah and Lainey had to fake date each other. They both have some misconceptions about each other and seeing them discover that these weren't true was so cute! 
 Micah is seen as a bad boy because he has piercings and a Mohawk. But GOSH he is so not what everybody believes! And I am so happy that he got to show his side. He was so funny and cute and actually really helpful to Lainey's journey of self discovery. (Also, there's a novella about Micah called Infinite Repeat which I am DYING for.) 
 Micah and Lainey's interactions were so lovely and smile inducing! Even as a fake couple they had loads of more chemistry than Lainey and her ex. 
 I really like how the story was paced and that Lainey had really amazing character growth. The Lainey at the beginning of the book is a completely different person from the Lainey at the end. I loved seeing her change and grow throughout. 
 Overall this is a book about much more than strategizing to win back someone's ex. It's about a girl's journey to self-discovery, with wonderful friendships, cute romantic situations, and a swoony male interest.

1,"Based on what I've been reading lately, some folks recommended this book to me, since it followed some of the same tropes as the other books. It looked and sounded interesting, and I was on a buying kick, so it wound up in my to-read pile. I might have been expecting too much out of it, but I was disappointed with the story. 
 Some of the writing was just ... bad. I hate to say that, but it's true. The first chapter was peppered with sentence fragments that I believe were intended to convey a sense of urgency to the action, but instead I kept tripping over them. They actually had the opposite effect, since every time I read one, I slowed down. There was also an egregious comma splice that may as well have jumped up and slapped me, as much as it pulled me out of the story. Later in the novel, the writing either improved, or I just managed to get used to the style, because it became less noticeable. But one thing that couldn't improve was the overall juvenile feel of the narrative. It seemed to lack theme or meaning beyond what was happening on the page, and sometimes it just felt like it was written by a fourteen year-old. There was a lot of use of a character saying ""Shit"" as a means of showing frustration at the end of a chapter or section, and there were a handful of strangely random moments where the author was trying to be humorous by pointing out the awkwardness between characters. It was like he was drawing on episodes of ""Seinfeld"" instead of trying to find genuine moments in the story to lighten the mood. 
 The mix of characters seemed odd to me, as none of them were particularly sympathetic. Logen Ninefingers, the Northerner (called ""the Barbarian"" by the city folks) is probably meant to be the protagonist, or possibly Bayaz, the First of the Magi, but a good deal of the book focuses on Jezal dan Luthar, a swordsman with no real ambition and an ego that's inversely proportional to said ambition, and Inquisitor Glokta, a paranoid torturer whose internal monologues are about as tiresome as Anna's from Fifty Shades of Grey. In fact, Glokta's probably the biggest issue I have with the book. He's supposed to be a political figure past his prime, and that might be an important part for a story like this, but he's so mistrusting and so paranoid that he has to have his snide comments running through his head all the time. It got old fast, and I think that's a major part of why this novel slowed me down so much. 
 There's a startlingly prescient moment about a quarter of the way where one of the characters is talking about one of her history books: 
 Lots of boring rubbish.... Full of wise Magi, stern knights with mighty swords and ladies with mightier bosoms. Magic, violence and romance, in equal measure. Utter shit. 
 The Blade Itself isn't quite that bad -- it at least tries to avoid the usual fantasy cliches by making the Magi aloof and/or similar to everyday people, and the knights are a bit more seat-of-their-pants than one would expect from high fantasy -- but it's still a pretty good summary of this novel. I get the feeling that Abercrombie is writing a serious parody, but in the end, it winds up not being quite the pastiche of fantasy that I think the author is going for. 
 Let's put it this way: the last few books I read found me snatching moments here and there throughout my day to see what was going to happen next; with The Blade Itself, I more or less had to force myself to keep reading. It wasn't compelling, and it wasn't all that interesting. For much of it, I was just struggling to figure out the point of it all. The story leads you from one point to another without any real motivation of clear direction, and I just couldn't care about any of it, least of all the characters. By the time some semblance of a plot started to show, I was thirty pages from the end of the book. I don't mind reading a series at all, but if you want to keep me interested in them, you have to have a discernible plot, a reason to keep reading, if you will, in each book. Don't patronize me by making the first book a ridiculous amount of exposition and character development and then ending it with a cliffhanger that's supposed to make me read the next one. 
 I kept expecting the book to get better the more I read it. Surely, I thought, some point will come from all of this. Won't it? But it didn't. I honestly don't get why this book is so popular."

 Cinder is a pretty cool protagonist being a teenage mechanic cyborg. (view spoiler)[ As soon as Princess Selene was mentioned I knew it would be Cinder. (hide spoiler)]. 
 Iko was amazing and I hope Cinder brings her back in future books. 
 I do hope Prince Kai and Cinder end up together - I so ship them! 
 (view spoiler)[ I was really sad that Peony didn't make it she was a really likeable character especially compared to Adri and Pearl! (hide spoiler)] 
 Dr Erland really grew on me throughout the book. I didn't think he'd play such a vital character at first and he generally cares about his people and Cinder in my opinion. 
 Queen Lavana. Wow what a manipulative cow who is apparently quite ugly. I'm expecting many more evil things from her and not Disney evil more like GoT evil things and manipulation. 
 Overall Cinder was a brilliant read it kept a lot of aspects from Cinderella but this is in a whole other level and I can't wait to carry on with Scarlett!"
2,"The writing is still terrible, but surprisingly, I was still entertained."
4,This is absolutely stunning.
3,"I didn't love how this series ended, but again, it was good to listen to to pass some time while doing other things. The second book was my favorite of the three."
4,"The last quarter of the book made it for me. To be honest, i'm not sure who i'm supposed to like and who i'm not but i (view spoiler)[hated Thalia and the Grace parents. (hide spoiler)]"
5,"FAIR WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A LOT OF SPOILERS. 
 I am feeling a lot of emotions simultaneously... BECAUSE THIS IS IT. THE FINAL BOOK OF THE HEROES OF OLYMPUS. 
 I got my hands on The Blood of Olympus since the very first day it was released, which was on October 7, 2014. I am waiting for the ""right moment"" to read it, because one does not simply want to end a series that means a lot to her. And oh boy, I am still very attached. 
 The story is told in the point of views of: Jason, Reyna, Leo, Nico, and Piper. I really love that Rick Riordan let me enter their minds and feel their emotions, which is a really great thing. 
 I also noticed that Percy and Annabeth has no p.o.v. and I thought Uncle Rick was going to kill them, but I was wrong (thank the gods.) He just focused the spotlight to the characters who are mysterious and teensy bit yet unkown. These two had their fair share of exposure in the past books, and I just wanted to say that PERCABETH IS FOREVER!!! 
 The first heightened emotion that I felt while reading the book was when Jason got stabbed. I was like, ""Really?! Just like that you're going to kill a great character?!"" I'm so nervous because this is the final book and there's a big possibility that a lot of the characters will die. But let me tell you this: This is not a typical book with cliches. On the other hand, I think it really suits Jason when he started wearing eyeglasses. Oh, all-american boy! *hearts everywhere* 
 Nico carried so much sadness, loneliness, and heartache. Gosh, this boy is a keeper. Good thing there's Reyna who got his back -- their relationship is so genuine, and it's one of the things I love about the book. Oh, and seeing Nico in a multicolored Isla Del Encantorico shirt? Priceless. I am so glad that his p.o.v is included in the story. That part when he turned the Roman demigod, Bryce Lawrence, into a ghost was a bit disturbing and badass at the same time. 
 Piper is not my most favorite character because I still ship Jason and Reyna, but I guess I just have to move on and accept the fact. Well, she and Jason aren't that bad a team. It's awesome that she has a Cherokee ancestor. She is lovable too! 
 I love the concept of the Amazons and the Hunters of Artemis about men. The force of feminism is strong in these two, but I guess they also have to take a chill pill once in a while. 
 Hazel and Frank are like old people trapped in teenagers' body. That applies to Hazel very well, and Frank has really developed from a klutz into a very strong man. 
 Leo Valdez -- my ultimate book boyfriend -- never ceases to amaze me with his creativeness, charm, intelligence, and oh everything about him. Calypso is one lucky girl for having this witty, scrawny boy. The Valdezinator that he invented was really brilliant. 
 * * * 
 MY THOUGHTS ABOUT THE ENDING: 
 * Gaea was defeated so easily? Man, I thought she would put up more fight. It's like she had more exposures when she interfered the demigods in their adventures while she was asleep. She was practically weaker for me when she was awaken. 
 * Over the time, unique names have been made for OTPs: Solangelo, Caleo, Percabeth, Frazel, Jeyna ... and a lot more! Especially when you pair boys to boys/girls to girls. 
 * Coach Hedge named his son 'Chuck' -- maybe it was because of Chuck Norris? You know, that Satyr is really into martial arts and stuff. 
 * WHY DID YOU KILL LEO??? DO YOU KNOW THAT MY HEART CRUMBLED AND I CRIED SO HARD AND OH GOSH THAT WAS SO TERRIBLE. I AM SO FULL OF GRIEF THAT TIME. 
 * I SHIP NICO DI ANGELO AND WILL SOLACE BIG TIME. (SOLANGELO ALL THE WAY!) 
 * The last chapter is somehow like the end of a movie where an upbeat or sad music is already playing and you know that you are near the credits. 
 * I really hoped that Calypso and Leo had more moments. One chapter is not enough for their love story (heck, I want more of this series.) Yet it made me contentedly happy that this book ended very well. 
 OVERALL: 
 This book broke my feels and I'm going to miss everyone and everything about it. The twists and wonders never failed to surprise me. Oh styx, I am suffering from post book depression. Uncle Rick, you really are awesome, and this book is worth the year-long wait."
4,"An interesting read, to be sure. Fun and rich. I'm curious to see where the story goes from here."
5,"Julie Otsuka has a really beautiful writing style -- it seems so effortless and flowy, yet it's smart and witty at the right times. And touching, at all times."
5,"** spoiler alert ** 
 4.5 stars 
 First of all, I love this series, but this book was too long for me, it dragged and dragged. I just wanted more of Rhys and Feyre, and all I got was war preparations, Hybern and some more war prep. Ugh. I really hope the next book will be a bit better."
2,"I really enjoy Carriger's witty writing style. This story is fun and unique. I enjoy the characters overall. But the last two books haven't lived up to what I was expecting I suppose. I feel like it is one of those it must be me things. It just seemed that getting to the point of the story would take ages and patience just isn't my virtue. I like to get a little hint of something and feel that there is some real genuine progress. Also while I enjoy Carrigers wit I found the endless comments about Alexia's pregnant size seemed enless. What may be funny a few times starts to be annoying when overly repeated. All in all I'm sure most fans of the book will enjoy it and I'm glad I read it, but it just didn't have that something I needed to make it more than okay for me."
5,Just had to read Iron's Prophecy - and I wonder what the oracle proclaimed in that would actually happen in next books of the Call of the Forgotten since The Lost Prince had none of it (maybe the end of it was a bit like it but it wasn't what the Iron's Prophecy suggested).
4,I enjoyed this vampire story more than I thought I would. In fact I wouldn't be averse to reading more about these guys!
5,"Bravo to the authors, because this book was fantastic! Another Hit man hit. ;) I loved getting to see the softer sides of Vasily, and I loved the way Naomi accepted every part of him, the way he accepted her. Theirs is definitely a beautiful connection in which they accept each other, and, despite their differences, fit together perfectly. The sex scenes were scorching, such as in the plane, in the hotel, and in the shower to name a few. I cracked up laughing every time Naomi gave her brother TMI. I can't wait for more in this series! I very highly recommend. <3"
5,Not what I expected. Didn't see it coming. Very good read!
4,"I very much enjoyed the scope of this world. It's been ages since I read a fantasy novel that felt so vast. It's a shame the characters didn't have as much depth. They weren't one-dimensional per se, but they came across as plot devices to me. Of course, every character is a plot device in a way, but I just couldn't get a grasp on their personalities, beyond e.g. ""reluctant hero"" or ""stubborn woman"". I also felt like they contradicted themselves a lot from scene to scene, and not in a ""something has changed in the meantime to make them change their minds"" sense. The Wheel weaves as the wheel wills! No, we must change these events! She's going home now! No, she's part of the pattern, she stays! 
 Overall, I truly enjoyed this book, and I'll gladly read the next ones... but I wish I cared about the characters more (Rand and Mat in particular, since they interest me the least... despite probably being the most central ones)."
5,"I'm not really a fan of romance, especially YA romance because all the ones I have read usually just don't have anything very much redeemable about them, but ""Waterfall"" was an amazing book and while I wasn't sure of what to expect, I was pretty much hooked right after the first chapter. What makes this book work is the cast of characters. Gabi as a main character and first person narrator is a great female protagonist. My main mark against YA romance in general is that the girls usually seem to be shallow and stupid, but Gabi doesn't come across like that. She's smart, she's funny, and she's entertaining to read about. I totally love time travel romances for the fact that the modern day girls get the awesome manly men of whatever time period they go to, and this book did not fail to deliver in that aspect. Marcello and Luca are amazing characters. Marcello is that loyally devoted sort that is typical of a real knight but yet he's not overbearing. Luca is the faithful companion, and the joker, and I fell in love with him at once. I think he's still my favorite character. And Gabi's sister Lia is cool too. 
 I think what I really appreciated about this is that sometimes in time travel novels, the characters end up showing a disdain about the past or they might just have that annoying teenage attitude. But these girls didn't. And even though they both were quite good with their weapons, they were never so good they outshone the boys and they never had the attitude about it, they just did what they had to. They tried to fit in as well as they could. It might have been because they actually knew a lot about the past, seeing as their parents were archeologists, but it was refreshing. I also liked how they travel back in time via the old tomb. Sometimes time travel books are so overblown in the way they go back, but this one made sense to me. 
 The author also gets top marks from me for creating such nasty and hatable villains. I love a good villain and all the guys in here were 'major creeporama"" as Gabi said. One thing I loved about this book is how, because it's in first person, you will have Gabi talking to the other characters in medieval speak and then in her head she will say random modern stuff. It's very entertaining! 
 This book actually reminded me of Lynn Kurland's time travel romances (which are pretty much the only romances I read) because all the characters were of the same calibre and between them and the story line, this was just a very enjoyable book to read. And also one of those you can't very easily put down! I think it deserves five stars easily!"
2,"This is the final book in the Dark Materials trilogy, and contains the battle of Lord Asriel's forces against the forces of the Regent of Angels. There are three main focal points of this book: Dr. Mary Malone and her slow exploration of Dust in an alien world; Mrs. Coulter and her machinations; and Will and Lyra, who venture into the Land of the Dead. I enjoyed the chapters on Mrs. Coulter the most--she is a vivid, wildly demanding person, and I was fascinated by her skill at manipulation. The other characters felt less real. They seemed to act only how and when it would serve the plot, which is clunky at best. The villains are ineffectual and always defeated by the protagonists, generally through sheer chance. 
 Overall, this book read as though Pullman had written an outline of what his fantasy series should say. ""Now it's time to confront Death,"" his outline says, ""and now it is time for a supreme sacrifice."" Moreover, I got really sick of the weird focus on Christianity."
4,I can't tell if this was a good story or just formatted in a way that kept my attention.
5,"Um, where is the 6th star?! No seriously, where is it? 
 Well if I didn't love Tiffany Schmidt before I do now after reading Bright Before Sunrise. Seriously, is there a way to give more than 5 out of 5 stars??? Because really, this book deserves it if there is. It was clever and fun and honest. It truly was a pleasure to read every word and I hated that it ended so soon because it was fantastic! 
 Bright Before Sunrise is the story of Brighton and Jonah(love the names by the way!), two teenagers that have nothing in common except they go to the same school. Brighton is peppy and into school spirit, at least on the outside, while Jonah is angry at a lot of things, especially having to more to a new house and school in the second half of his senior year. When circumstances force these two to spend a night together things go from bad to worse, from up to down, from hate to the possibility of love. For two people that thought they had nothing in common, in the course of one night, realize there is more to the other than they ever thought and find out there may just be more to themselves as well. 
 Do you know what I loved about this book, well besides that fact that it was written by Tiffany Schmidt? I loved that we got two totally different voices from totally different characters. I know, I know, there are a ton of books out there that have dual POVs, I haven't been living under a rock. I've read a bunch myself. But what I liked the best about it is Bright Before Sunrise is although it is a book written by one author it could have easily been two based on the characters(if that makes any sense). Basically Schmidt gave us a wide range of her writing prowess by making Jonah and Brighton so opposite each other that they may have been on different scales. And the fun part about it, they were both putting on a front which then made them more a like then you could imagine. 
 The other great part of this book was the chemistry between Brighton and Jonah even when Jonah was being surly to her and she was putting on her happy face. Beneath their initial reactions to each other there was a connection even in their differences. You could feel the draw they had to each other leap off the pages even when they were trying to pretend it wasn't there. Between the banter and the confusion of what they really felt, there was a deep connection that was shown seamlessly in their actions. Was Jonah a jerk and Bright fake at times? Absolutely. But for some inexplicable reason they had each other's backs no matter what. Watching these two change from the beginning of the book to the end was really a great thing to see unfold. 
 I know, this review probably doesn't make a lick of sense, but I had so many feels(all amazing) about this story that it is hard to get my thoughts and emotions down on paper. It was flawlessly written, had strong characters with a great story, and had some nice moments of teenage uncertainty mixed in. Basically all you need to know is that Bright Before Sunrise is a must read so get on that!"

 Full review can be found here. 
 First of all, let's get the bad out of the way. The language use was often clunky with terms and expressions that really didn't fit the era. As for the foreign language use, I couldn't believe how bad it was considering this book was published by traditional means: close to every single sentence in French (that went beyond one word) had either grammar or spelling mistakes - or both. I did write them all down but then I lost the piece of paper it was on. In German, it's not ""heisse"", it's ""heisse"". It's really not that hard to find the eszet in the character map, but ss is always used after the diphthong ""ei"", and not double 's'. (I know some people say that's it's pretty much the same thing, but all of the Germans that I know, and living next door to Germany I know a fair few, are adamant that the eszet should be used.) The Russian I can't comment on. 
 It can't be that hard to get native speakers of these languages to quickly proof read the little excerpts written in them, especially not in the USA where so many people speak multiple languages fluently. 
 The other bad thing came at the end of the story when Percy did a complete 180 character turn and became a snivelling, useless lump of lard when she gets rejected. She'd been such a strong female character up until that point. Why change her into a woman dependant on the affections of a man at this point? She morphs into this ridiculous character that I no longer wanted to read about. 
 Now the good. The author takes a Greek tale - that of the goddess Persephone being tricked by Hades into leaving her winged lover and becoming his wife in his domain - and adapts it to Victorian England life. I have to admit, at first I had absolutely no idea what was going on in the prologue. It became clear soon enough, though, with the legend coming out in bits and pieces throughout the plot. Somebody more familiar with Greek mythology than I may have been able to spot what it was all leading to sooner than I did. 
 The reader is aware that Percy is Alexi's eternal lover, whom we meet in her goddess form in the prologue, but neither of the characters is aware of this. It was actually rather sweet watching them interact with each other as Percy tries to stamp out her attraction to this much older man, and Alexi tries to figure out just what it is about Percy Parker that draws him to her. They had some very interesting scenes together during his private tutoring of her and I liked how their relationship grew. Well, until it destroyed everything Percy was and had stood for, as mentioned above. 
 I liked the other members of Alexi's group as well. They were all interesting characters and I hope to see more of the romance Michael feels for Rebecca now that Rebecca has to face the fact that, despite her feelings, Alexi will never be hers. It was also fun, in an infuriating way, to watch them all being blind-sided by the woman the reader knows to be Hades's envoy while rejecting Percy because she's ""too young"" and so couldn't possibly be their equal. 
 One thing that I wasn't so sure about was that Jack the Ripper was actually a Cerberus sent by Hades to bring his wife back to him. It was an interesting take on the events, but I didn't really buy it. Over the years, I've seen better interpretations of just what Jack the Ripper was (with him not being a normal human being) and this own seemed a little too far-fetched to me. Nevertheless, the Cerberus was still a formidable foe! 
 Oh, and from the way he's described, I imagined Alexi as Alan Rickman! 
 (That's ok, 'cuz Alan Rickman's pretty darn good looking!)"
4,"This book has a fascinating concept. In this post-apocalyptic world, oxygen is a limited resource, doled out according to wealth. It's a commodity that can be bought, and the poor have to make do with very little. 
 I found the set up very interesting, and I like the construction of the pod. It felt imaginative and unique. It wasn't a regurgitation of any other dystopian YA that I'd read. 
 The best part of this book, by far, was the science fiction aspect. I love reading about what the world had turned into. How the depletion of oxygen in the atmosphere affected the way things worked. It was well thought out and truly devastating. The complex morals work well, like how the characters never truly know what's the right thing to do, and which side is right. 
 This is a book that massively improves as it goes along. I found it slow in the beginning, but once it hit its stride it sucked me in. The end is big and climactic and heartbreaking, everything you want in this kind of book. 
 It's another one with multiple POVs. Alina, the beautiful, brave, ruthless Resistance fighter, Bea, the moral lower-class girl suffering from unrequited love, and Quinn, the rich, oblivious, but well-meaning object of her affection. 
 I really get engaged in the story once Bea's narrative starts- you're invested in her, she suffers the most and you root for her. She's not particularly plucky, which can be a problem sometimes with protagonists, but in dystopian YA I actually find that slightly refreshing. She's compassionate and her emotions feel the deepest of all the narrators. She's got a spine when she needs it and she's very moral, which I also found refreshing. She becomes bigger than herself by the end. Full of fire. 
 Quinn can be a stereotypical oblivious boy, but I like that he wasn't idealized, and he could be funny. I love how Quinn's eyes get opened to the reality of his world. I love how he grows and hardens into someone worth admiring. 
 Alina, while she gives us the most information about this oxygen-less planet, is probably the hardest to get a feel for of the three narrators, despite the fact that she's the warrior Resistance fighter. But her character really opens up as well. By the latter half I warmed to her, just as she warmed up in general 
 None of the characters are overly brimming with personality (apart from possibly Quinn, who is the most flawed,). The romance- touted as a love triangle- is not precisely that, and feels a little anemic, though it does hit all the right notes. And I wanted Bea to be happiest most of all. 
 There isn't much difference between the three voices (again, with the exception of Quinn, at times) though they did not all have the same personality. I liked watching them interact and play off one another. Maude, naturally, is the most fun, and really livens up the book when she appears. 
 At first the dynamics of the dystopian world are a little confusing. I appreciate the author's decision not to set aside ten pages dedicated only to explaining how things work and why things are this way, but I actually would have appreciated a bit more explication. Maybe I was just having a slow day, but I had difficulty grasping the world right away, which is pretty key in dystopian fiction. As the story went on, though, it became clearer, and then it becomes fascinating. And the ball gets rolling so fast you cling on with your fingernails. 
 BREATHE is a quick read that picks up its pace about halfway through, which is when I most got into it. I did enjoy it, particularly the latter half. It's well-written, unique, and interesting. The characters improve a lot. This is a book that I ended up loving, though I didn't start out that way. But sticking with it was worth it. I will read the sequel, because I greatly enjoyed the plot of this book, and hope that I'll just get to know the characters better.

0,Okay. It's out now. Now I just need to get my hands on it... CAN'T WAIT. It sounds absolutely adorable.
4,"I think it's more 3.7 than 4 star book but whatever. 
 Tooth and Claw is set amid a hierarchical society of Dragon's that includes a noble ruling class, an established church, servants and retainers. Dragons ritually eat dragons in order to gain strength and power. The story and plot are rather simple - the story begins with the death of Bon Gornin who wished that his children receive good shares of his dowry and his flesh. However his greedy son-in-law, Illustrious Daverak, consumes more than his fair share of the departed dragon, setting off a chain of unexpected events for each sibling. Avan, the younger son, decides to litigate for compensation. One unmarried daughter, who moves to Daverak's property, discovers a house filled with injustice, while the other unmarried daughter goes off with Penn and falls in love. 
 The book contains political intrigue and romance, what sets it apart from many similar books is the fact that all the heroes and heroine are dragons. Societyis not only hierarchical, it also requite aspiring dragons to follow complicated etiquette (choosing a part of your deceased parent to eat is also a part of etiquette). 
 The world is very Victorian, down to parsonages, elegant ladies, balls to catch a husband at and all the strange etiquette. There's quite a bit of focus on female characters - siblings Haner and Selendra. The book contains a healthy dose of wry humor and wit. Romantic plot is central but I didn't mind it. 
 I liked the book. In the beginning I thought it was hilarious however as the story developed I found descriptions of complicated etiquette tiring just a little bit. Also the story was rather predictable and characters development wasn't always credible. On the other hand I think this book should be read more like an exercise in imagination and Victorian setting. If you'll agree not to seek for layers of hidden depth (although some can be find easily), you'll receive entertaining, well written and rather uplifting lecture. 
 Well done Ms. Wolton."
3,"The first in Charlaine Harris's Sookie Stackhouse mysteries, ""Dead Until Dark"" is the basis for the HBO show ""True Blood"", and has been appropriately dubbed ""'Twilight' for adults"". Harris's vampire love story is worlds better than Stephanie Meyer's Twilight books for several reasons: 1) Harris is a better writer, 2) lots of kinky sex, 3) the Louisiana setting (gotta love redneck vampires...), and 4) a fascinating premise (in Harris's world, vampires have ""come out of the coffin"", so to speak, and revealed themselves to normal humans. A synthetic blood product created by the Japanese enables vampires to stop feeding on humans. Some vampires attempt to ""mainstream"" into regular society, while others continue to live in the shadows and carry on as they have for centuries. Meanwhile, vampires have become the new disenfranchised minority group.) Fun, quick read with a not-so-subtle social commentary. Fans of Casey Daniels and Laurel K. Hamilton will enjoy. BTW: the TV show ""True Blood"" is actually pretty darn good."
5,Wow. This book picks up kind of right after the last one finished. But this one had none of the slowness and set up that kind of turned me off on the first one. I still am amazed that so many people read this series when it took me literally 150 pages to really get interested in the first book. But this book makes a lot of that worth while. I really did not see the plot twist coming and I am very excited to start the next book.
5,"Nobody writes dark urban fantasy like Stacia Kane. The author creates a world where ghosts wreak havoc and people turn to the Church to protect them. The Church provides people specially trained to get rid of ghosts. This is a world where summoning a ghost results in the death penalty. Ghosts kill and steal energy. 
 Part of the allure of this series is the way that the characters are written. Almost every character is flawed and yet, the reader feels invested in that character's well-being. The main character Chess Putnam is a Church debunker or Church witch. Chess has a serious drug dependency problem - she is often strung out on a combination of pills. Even though she is an addict, Chess is surprisingly lucid, very good at her job, and able to research and solve her cases. 
 Speaking of characters, this series has one of my favorite scary enforcers named Terrible. Oh, Terrible. If I saw you out in the streets, I would run in the opposite direction. Terrible is huge and not very attractive. The way he is written, the way he speaks, makes the reader see him in a different life. You want him to have a happy ending. He deserves it. 
 In this book, we learn more about Chess' past. We learn why she is so damaged and why she has become so drug dependent. Chess' past gives us a clue why Chess cannot understand that someone could love her. 
 There is a kind of love triangle going on. Stick with the books, the triangle is a function of Chess' lack of self-respect rather than stringing on two men at a time. 
 I can't write a review about this book or this series without mentioning Downspeak the slang/patios used by residents of Downside. It adds a realistic touch to the chatter, dig? 
 This series is not for everyone. It is most definitely an adult series, with adult situations and themes. If you like dark, urban fantasy, it is one of the better series out there."
0,Excellent writing but a story that managed to push all my buttons. I'm out.
4,"If you're looking for anything historically accurate, this is not the book for you. This book is full of Katie MacAlister's token humor, but set in Regency England as opposed to her typical modern day setting. 
 There were lots of laugh-out-loud moments in this book. The heroine had a way with setting things on fire and fussing over her husband's anatomy. Another reviewer compared her to I LOVE LUCY, and I think that was a good comparison. 
 I won't spoil it for you -- but there were a couple of really funny scenes that made this book. I recommend this if you like humor :)"

 Review to come. . .(hint: I LOVED IT)"
5,Now I have to buy this book so I can read it again and again.
3,"I'm going to preface this all by saying that this is going to be a weird review; I really liked this book, a lot in fact, I just have some issues with the way it was marketed. 
 Fred and Ryan couldn't be more different. Fred is an American Indian who lives in a reservation outside of Phoenix, AZ with her hard-working but beaten down father, her alcoholic mother, and her bad boy older brother. She doesn't have a car, a cell phone, or even an iPod, but she is extremely good at golf (her dad is the groundskeeper at the local country club) and when the coach at her high school offers her a spot on the golf team she's suddenly forced into a world where most people, herself included, think she doesn't belong. Ryan is also very good at golf, but he lives in a wealthy suburb, drives a new Jeep, and has a seemingly perfect family. However, Ryan has a self-destructive best friend, a bitchy girlfriend, and his family isn't quite as perfect as they same. When Fred and Ryan are forced together on the golf team they immediately hate each other. Fred doesn't trust anyone and Ryan is mad that his best friend was kicked off the team to make room for Fred. But eventually an attraction develops and Fred and Ryan have to decide who they really want to be. 
 My issue with this book isn't the story. I really liked the story and the characters of Fred and Ryan. What I didn't like is how much the love story was stressed. After reading it I wished the book was promoted as more of a coming of age story than a romance. Yes there is romance in the book, and I really liked the romance, I found the way the feelings developed, how the romance played out, and the hesitations the two main characters had to be very realistic. But, in the end, I didn't think the romance was that big of a part of the story. To me the romance served as the backdrop for Fred and Ryan to grow as people and the large majority of the book focused more on them as individuals than on them as a couple. But when the cover image is of a girl lying on top of a guy and they're about to kiss it seems to imply that the story contained with in that cover is all about romance. 
 All that said I did really like the story. A girl and a guy from different backgrounds dating and dealing with outside pressure isn't a groundbreaking idea, but Liz Fichera did a great job of putting her own spin on the story. The setting in the American southwest and on an Indian reservation gave the book some flair and depth which I definitely appreciated. And as a big sports fan I liked that golf, something I don't think I've ever seen featured in a YA book before, was Fred and Ryan's sport of choice. 
 My only other issue with the book, and it's not a big thing, is the font. Since the story is told from both Fred and Ryan's perspectives a different front is used for each of their chapters. Ryan's font was fine, but Fred's font was more flowy and printed almost grey on the page which, for me, made it kind of difficult to see.

4,"Another great read from Elle Kennedy 
 I loved The Deal but I'm not really interested in reading The Mistake. I can't really explain it but books 1 & 3 sounded awesome so since they can be read as a stand alone, that's what I did. 
 Every single time I felt like the story was starting to drag or get uninteresting, BAM, something cool or crazy happens. NEEEVVER saw that (view spoiler)[death (hide spoiler)] coming. Like... Never. I was like *GASP*. For real I actually gasped out loud. 
 I really liked Ally. She was the perfect mixture of cool, confident and feminine. Even if she did have a dad that ""boy-ed"" her up some. She was perfect for Dean. (view spoiler)[AND I LOVE THAT DEAN SAID I LOVE YOU FIRST AND IT WAS SOOO SWEET (hide spoiler)] 
 Okay, so anyway, Dean is awesome and I was super happy to see him follow a dream he didn't even know he had. I was also excited when Ally's dad became accepting of Dean. It was such a man move, haha, all grunting and fierce. Cute. 
 Character growth was SO evident in these two."
3,"For those that have read the Ellora's Cave series The Others is based on, this book isn't really an expansion of Faer Fetched (Fantasy Fix #3). Rather, it's a total rewrite. The story features Danice, a lawyer, and Mac, a half-Fae Changeling. That's about where the similarities end. :D 
 Entertaining read despite a few problems. Nothing spectacular here and not really anything that adds to overall The Other universe. (Except maybe a curse cast on another character at the end of the book.) I didn't quite get the relationship between Mac and Danice; something was missing and it felt more like a friendship than a passionate romance. When I found myself wanting to skim through the sex scenes to pick out the conversation, I knew something wasn't working. Additionally, for a hot-shot attorney, Danice sure doesn't know when to keep her mouth shut. There were a few times I really had to question her intelligence; she was walking into a dangerous situation, not knowing the power or strengths of the Fae involved, and she got smart with them. I'm supposed to believe she's able to hold her own in a courtroom or negotiations? But, those were the main problems and for the most part I enjoyed the book."
5,"Live <33 Amazon https://www.amazon.com/How-Date-Douch... 
 5 Zeke stars <33 
 ""I might be a douchebag, but I'm not a quitter."" 
 I don't know where to start, I freaking loved this book! Zeke is by far my favorite douchebag! I finished this book days ago and I'm still thinking about the story and the characters! 
 Zeke was an asshole and I wanted to know why, he intrigued me. Violet was exactly what he needed, she was the light in his darkness. She was sweet, kind, friendly and lovable. Zeke is slowly drawn to her and what they start feeling for each other is magical. Sweet, intense and hot. 
 ""Are you making fun of me, Violet DeLuca?"" 
 ""It's called teasing,Ezekiel Daniels."" 
 (Omg *sigh* this is me drooling over this there were so many parts I freaking loved and marked so I can re-read them again.<3 <3) 
 I loved how they started as friends even though it was difficult for Zeke, they were funny and adorable. They made me swoon. 
 Sara Ney is a new author to me but I can assure you that she immediately became one of my favorites so if you haven't tried one of her books, pick this series because you will not regret it!"
4,"I quite enjoy the time travel aspect of this series, however the overt romance drags it down. I can do without the constant woe-ing over Gideon."
4,"Although not a Full Cast production, this story has 3 narrators to go along with the 3 voices and main characters in this book: 
 - Annie who used to love Duncan. 
 - Duncan who thinks he loves Annie, but is really obsessed with former rock star Tucker Crowe. 
 - and Tucker Crowe - a washed up former rock star who is trying to find some purpose to his life. 
 Hornby's magical touch creates 3 very realistic ordinary characters whose lives will make you laugh and also make you stop and reflect on your own life. Although his books often seem like storylines for future Hollywood blockbusters, they are enjoyable and easy to relate to. And, he is the featured lunch speaker at tomorrow's conference for Northern California booksellers - can't wait to meet him!"
3,"I'm torn. Boy, am I ever torn. I adore the author, I really do but... I don't adore this book. Actually, I didn't even like it very much. If this was a book by an unknown author, it would have been a straight two stars, I'm not going to lie. But since there is a reconnection with much beloved characters from the Parasol Protectorate, I really can't decide. 
 The reasons why this book didn't really work for me are... murky. On the surface we have a similar kind of no-nonsense heroine who thrives on being eccentric and conservative at the same time but Rue... I just didn't feel her. In fact, I felt none of the characters in this book. Yes, of course (and I'm sure the author must be bored to tears by the undoubtedly numerous comparisons between Alexia and Rue) there are similarities and the Parasol Protectorate is full of silly, delightful characters but from where I'm standing now, they seemed like characters and not like the cartoon images of real people. 
 I like the over-the-topness (and if this isn't a word, it ought to be) of Gail Carriger's books but this just too... OTT, too cartoonish, too absurd, too something and not enough of another thing. I wanted to love it but I don't. Still, well crafted (though Rue's complete cluelessness grated on my nerves) so I'm giving it three stars, if only for old times sake's."
0,"The author of this book is obviously talented. I just wish I had not read this particular book. 
 I can't really string many words together right now, so a review may come later. Well, honestly... most likely one won't. I just want to scrub my brain of the details of this book. 
 Right now I just need to seek some peace."
3,"I liked the book but it's not my favorite from the ones I've read. 
 Favorite character: Thorne 
 Least favorite character: I don't have one... 
 Favorite part: The way we get glimpses to other vampires and their stories. 
 Least favorite part: I felt the book was slow at some points. 
 I read this book back in 2013 and I don't know why I didn't review it back then... Now I feel I should re-read it to give it a better review."
5,"This book was definitely a lot better than I expected. 
 The summary does not do it justice. 
 I found most of the characters to be very well developed, especially Pia. I know that sometimes she does the most infuriating things, but I was able to understand why she did it. She was a very strong female character, and I liked reading from her point of view. 
 The one character, however, that I did not like that much was Eio. He was very sweet, but he could be so stupid! At times, I just wanted to hit him because of his whole philosophy about ""I can climb an electric fence because I love Pia so much."" I just saw that as a dumb idea. He does know that there are other ways to sneak into Little Cam, right? 
 I also loved the plot in this book. It does start out a bit slow, but it does speed up and become very exciting. I felt like most of it was very realistic because it wasn't one of those books where none of the characters die. Even though my heart felt like it was going to break at times, I thought that the deaths of some of the characters really added to the story. 
 Another small aspect of the story that I enjoyed was the constant references to science, especially the similes that were used for this purpose. 
 I would definitely recommend this book because it brings a blend of futuristic science mixed with ancient beliefs!"
4,"A digital copy was provided via NG in exchange for an honest review. This did not influence my thoughts in any way. 
 Like a moth enchanted by the yellow-orange dancing swirls of a flame, the cover of this book hypnotized me. I have to say, it's very well done and absolutely gorgeous, and the blurb was interesting, too, so it's a no wonder that I instantly requested Firefly Hollow on Netgalley. I know there is a surplus of Romance/PR books out there, but honestly, a lot of those are wasted paper and are very subpar, so I've always been on a hunt for one that would give my heart backflips and somersaults. I may love science fiction, post-apocalyptic, and dystopian stories, but like any girl, I'm a hopeless romantic at heart. Fortunately, Firefly Hollow does not disappoint, as the content is just as beautiful as the cover. 
 The enchanting prose took me to an all new world. Haddix's writing has a way of immediately engaging and immersing the reader in the story from the very first page. Even though the pacing is slow, it doesn't feel dragging at all. It was such a delight to read all about Sarah's childhood -- her finding a spot by a pool in a mountain where she can spend time by herself, her getting saved by a black and grey wolf from a deadly rattlesnake, etc. -- and truly heartbreaking to read Owen's tragic and lonely past, a stage in his life that was full of mistrust and anger. I loved how you get to know the characters deeply and intimately, including their dreams, fears, and insecurities. I felt happy for Sarah when she was able to get a job, felt sad when she lost loved ones; I shared with Owen's sadness and frustrations during his early life, and also shared with his happiness when he found someone to live and die for. Even though these aren't our stories, Haddix made them personal to the reader nonetheless, which only proves how much of an effective writer she is, effortlessly making us fall in love with her characters despite all of their faults and worries. 
 However, I do lament the fact that the paranormal elements were not as strong as the romance one. Owen is a shifter, you see. He turns into a deer and into a wolf when he is absolutely mentally unstable and full of unwanted emotions. I've always been interested in shapeshifters, especially after reading Written in Red, but its role here is very minimal at best... It was only significant in a few short and early scenes, and then no more. :/...I also felt pretty bummed that after certain characters found out about his true nature, they were very accepting and didn't even question the authenticity, didn't get scared (I mean, I would be afraid, at least at first! That shit is of the fourth dimension, man!)... they just... accepted and then that's it! For a huge chunk of the middle of the book, the paranormal side became almost nonexistent, and then it came back in the end for a few short pages, and then... nothing! No drama out of it, no real astonishment, people just merely accepted it like it was nothing special and a common occurrence in daily life. ""Hey, did you know I can shapeshift into a blood-sucking bat?!"" ""Oh, really? Cool! Now could you pass me the salt, please?"" -_- of course it didn't go like that, but it could have well been. 
 Anyway, I'm well aware the romance was the central part of this book, but I felt that if the PR elements would be this little, then it would have been better if it weren't there in the first place. It's like putting a large scar on a character's face, but the scar is just for decoration; it has really no significance or any value to the character, and for me, that's, well, bullshit. Of course, this is subjective... I loved the story -- the characters were well done, the sex scenes were very sensual and romantic (not aggressive at all, very realistic portrayal) -- but the shapeshifting thing could have well been dropped and it wouldn't have affected the story either way. Maybe that's just me, but I believe if something is not truly vital and it's just there merely for the heck of it, then it's best to get rid of the thing. There is no need to add something unnecessary. 
 But overall, 4 stars to the beautiful, poetic writing and the character development of the two main characters. It was both heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time. I merely wish the PR stuff had more weight and role, but otherwise, it's a strong 4/5."
4,"There are a lot of romance stories that I think seem fairly realistic - but most of them contain huge amounts of emotional damage resulting from some kind of abuse or accident. They generally seem a bit overdone. 
 This is a story that is just real. I can see this happening in real life - especially one scene. Ava behaves really stupidly, out of a deep grief, and it was like watching a movie. Things like that happen all the time. 
 The book explores a lot of philosophy about life, its meaning and the big questions. It even explores Christianity to a minor extent. There are people from Montana and people from Los Angeles, and they all behave exactly as folks from those places behave. 
 The mechanics of the book work well too. It's well written and the characters are wonderfully developed. 
 I think the best part for me was the next to last chapter. I suppose this would make a nice, sappy Hallmark movie - but as a story, it worked beautifully and I'd hate to see it ruined by a cheesy script and so-so acting. 
 This was a read-it-in-one-sitting book for me, and I'll be picking up more from this author. It was a nice way to spend an afternoon."
5,"This one is definitely not a heart warming read that make your heart flutter. Don't expect flower or roses or some other similar shit. This one was a gritty, angsty, raw, violent and intense read that make my heart pounding madly and did a whole load of cursing. 
 Mae aka Salome was a sex slave imprisoned in a religious cult since she was a child. She grown up being sexually abused and fearing the life outside of the commune, until one day something happened and triggered her to make a life changing decision. She decided to flee. 
 Styx aka River was the Hades Hangmen MC's President and was known as the infamous Hangmen Mute because he never speaks except to his VP, Ky. Styx had a stutter that make him unable to speak in front of others, but only to his closest confident. 
 Mae and Styx met once fifteen years ago, across the commune fence and formed an unbreakable bond and connection. Years later, they met again under a different circumstances. Mae was injured and frighten of her life out of commune and Styx can't believe he found his wolf eyes girl again. 
 ""Well, I hope that I don't fall in love with you, 
 'cause falling in love just makes me blue."" 
 Due to his responsibility as the club President and the danger they were in, Styx decided to put Mae under one of his men care, Rider. At this time, Styx was with his usual club girl, Lois. I don't understand why did some people said Styx cheated, which in fact he was not with Mae at this point. So according to my evaluation, there is no cheating. You don't even get the details of the sex, so don't worry about it. 
 ""You have light within you, Styx, and I feel it shining through like the rays of the midday sun. It is beautiful."" 
 For the first time, Mae was experiencing freedom and life. She realized that people outside are not the devil as she perceived them to be and the true evil are the elders in the cult. While, Styx was avoiding her, she strike up a close friendship with Rider, the man who was assigned to take care of her. But she never once stop missing Styx and his kindness towards her. 
 ""You say it aint youwho is good and who will keep me safe, but you already have."" 
 The possibility of a love triangle make me damn uncomfortable. I'm the kind of reader who hates reading that stuff. There were some angst going on and what make it bearable for me is that Mae was very decisive on who she love from the very beginning. In her heart, there is only Styx, the boy she met all those years ago. Styx was being aggressive when he knew of Rider's intention but I like the fact that he fight for what belongs to him. He is the gang President after all and violence in inevitable. Nonetheless, I was hoping Mae handled the situation much better if she was not so naive about human nature. (view spoiler)[Some of her noble action and being so close to Rider was definitely not cool. I really wish she cut ties with that man and he in turned die during the confrontation. (hide spoiler)] 
 I'm not enjoying the hint of love triangle here. Urg! But after I finish the book, I came to understand we need those unpleasant stuff to happen to make the climax work and make me felt so emotionally invested, to make me turn page after page anxiously. 
 Considering there were so much fornication going on in the club, I was surprised by the lack of sex scene between Styx and Mae. There were some intense sex, but there isn't a really long drawn one that make my toe curl. Anyway, there were so much shit going on that it don't bother me that much. 
 There were some pretty nasty violence and the climax took place when Mae was hunted down by the elders. Will Styx be able to save his old lady? We also have some big revelation and surprises along the way. I really hope that asshole die. 
 This is a standalone with a HEA, but the epilogue hinted at something more at work next. Seriously, Flame, the psychopathic one need his own book, but I was hoping it won't be another chick from the religious cult. Anyway, we will see how it goes.

0,"I loved this book, Luc is so in love with Frannie and would do anything for her."
4,"An amazing fantasy stand-alone about genuinely terrifying fairies, a cursed prince, and two brave siblings caught in the middle. 
 I've had my eye on this book for a long time, and I'm so glad I finally read it because The Darkest Part of the Forest was absolutely magical, creative, and so beautifully written. Holly Black's writing style is captivating and dreamy and twisted; and although this story takes place in the real world, it feels like you are reading an old fairy-tale, which fits this book very well. 
 The siblings Hazel and Ben live in a small town called Fairfolk, a city surrounded by a haunted forest full of Fairy Folk. In that forest stands a glass coffin, in which lies a sleeping, beautiful boy with horns on his head. The boy has been asleep for centuries, and although Hazel and Ben once dreamed of saving him when they were younger, things are different now. 
 Both teenagers are hiding huge secrets for each other, but when one day the boy is freed and wicked fairies start crossing the forest borders into the human city, it's up to them to trust each other and save Fairfold. 
 Once, there was a girl who made a bargain with the Folk. She vowed she would save everyone in the world, but forget herself. 
 Things didn't end well. 
 I love Hazel and Ben, not only as main characters but also as siblings. One of my all-time-favourite shows is Gravity Falls and one of the central points of that show are sibling relationships, and likewise the bond between Hazel and Ben plays an important role in this book. No matter how different they are in character - Hazel is the daring, outspoken one while older brother Ben is more calm and hesitant - they support each other 100% (even going so far as to make a...very shadowy bargain with the Folk to keep the other's dream alive). 
 The Fae are another element of this book that I loved. You'll find no sweet, kind-hearted creatures in this book: the fairies are all manic and fierce and known for luring foolish people to their death. Yet this doesn't stop the citizens of Fairfolk from throwing parties around the glass coffin, and raising a changeling child as their own. This mix of reality with fairy-elements, of unrelenting human spirit against wicked fairy magic, gives this book such an exciting atmosphere and inspiring power. 
 My only complaint is that Black left a lot of her plot-lines half finished or not fleshed out enough (for example, Severin wasn't nearly enough in the story). However, the mystery of Fairfolk is very intriguing, the (LGBT!) romance in the novel is very cute, and overall this is a very enchanting story. 
 4 stars"
2,"I feel oddly disappointed in this book. The Valiant promises so much, but fell flat for me about halfway through the book. I can usually finish YA books about this size in about two days, but this? It's taken me a month-and-a-half to read. It was almost painful to read the last third of this book, even though that was where most of the action took place. I just didn't connect enough with any of the characters to really care if they died or not in the story. I think the beginning is actually exciting. But this is probably why my attention waned for the rest of the book. After an action-packed beginning, it was like taking a step backwards to reintroduce everything. 
 Fallon is a princess, and the younger sister of her father's band of warriors. She has a childhood friend, Mael, who loves her, and she him. But she doesn't want to be married or fall in love, because it had always been her dream to be a great fighter and join her father's war band. When things don't go as planned and Fallon gets captured by slave traders, everything changes for her. She winds up in Rome, under Julius Caesar's domain, and must fight and train as a gladiatrix, the female version of a gladiator. 
 ""Be brave, gladiatrix,"" he said. ""And be wary. Bright things beget treachery. Beautiful things breed envy. Once you win Caesar's love, you'll earn his enemies' hate."" 
 This book just had so much potential, but instead of enduring tension of training and fitting in with the other girls, we learn that Fallon is the best, and she's slowly falling for Caius Varro. From what I gather, Cai is pretty high up on the chain of command, or his family is wealthy, and he runs errands for Caesar. So, Fallon's a bit of a special snowflake. Fallon gets bullied, but that's really the extent of whatever hardship she has to endure (I mean, besides fighting in the arena like everyone else around her). She gets special attention from pretty much everyone she meets. And when she has questions about something? Everyone seems to tell her the answer. There's just a lot of telling in this book instead of showing. 
 I liked what we saw from the sister dynamic between Fallon and her older sister, Sorcha. I wish it was explored more, because I liked Sorcha, but it was still hard to glean her personality from the text. It's actually difficult to connect with any of the characters. The pairing between Fallon and Cai is a little too insta-love for me with only a handful of interactions between the two. Also, I'm not sure what the story was going for with the slave master who sold Fallon, and his declared love interest in...let's just say, someone close to Fallon, in order to avoid spoilers. I just really don't want there to be a romantic storyline or a way to ""humanize"" someone who is literally in the slave trading ""business"". The whole thing about the slave master just doesn't sit well with me. His sudden reappearance to the plot was just very convenient for the last few chapters of the book, like he was some last-minute addition thrown into the story. 
 I liked reading the beginning of the book, but that's about it. Everything else was a bit of a let down after I was so excited to read this book when I got the ARC. The ending was disappointing to me. There just wasn't any real reason for Fallon's choice at the end, and I just felt like it came out of nowhere. It seems unlikely at this point that I'll continue reading this series. 
 ***Thanks to Penguin Random House/Razorbill and Goodreads for providing me an ARC***"
4,"I have to say I didn't intend to read this so fast. I thought I would read the first few pages just to get a feel for the story and then put it down for later. Well, I ended up completely absorbed in the story and didn't want to put it down until I finished. While not without problems, this book is still engaging, interesting, creative, and absorbing with great complicated characters and a solid, well-written story. There is even a mystery side plot that is unfortunately completely unnecessary and distracting but is unlikely to really take away from the book. The elements are telegraphed early and often so shouldn't be any big surprise to readers but will fit in with the romantic ending. 
 This is mostly a character driven story with a small mystery woven into the plot. The majority of the action revolves around Zeke and Miles as they are first antagonistic and then sexual with each other while negotiating the minefield of personal expectations, disappointments, emotional baggage and the outside art world. While there are some conflicting personalities, the main characters have it rather easy and the majority of drama is self created. The few adversarial people are soon won over by Zeke's charm and any pesky journalistic problems are swept aside by the ease of money, privilege, and of course artistic temperament. 
 There is the mystery of the stolen/lost sketches with a few other elements related to that but all the clues are given freely and often throughout the story so the ending is rather telegraphed. While this was slightly annoying, the bigger annoyance was the prolonged confrontation and confession scene between the culprit and the characters. This involved an intelligent, meticulous, calculating, and amoral person suddenly confessing all to them in a groan-inducing moment. If you remember similar scenes from books and movies when the evil person always confesses everything before attempting to kill the hero? This was that scene without the threat of death. 
 Unfortunately not only was this annoying, but it was completely unnecessary. I didn't feel either the mystery or the resolution really added anything to the story, characters, or the writing. Just as the resolutions to the mystery of the missing sketches was ridiculously easy and totally unbelievable. Well I suppose it could be believable but it takes quite a bit of suspension of disbelief to accept the explanations the author has offered for the missing two sketches. Neither one felt authentic or keeping with the characters of either man, instead the answers are easy and tidy, wrapping up all possible problems and questions into neat, tight bows. 
 However as much as I've disagreed with the mystery portions, they are certainly not a reason to avoid the book as it is a smaller aspect of the story which focuses for the majority on the characters and their burgeoning relationship. Both Zeke and Miles are absorbing and intricate characters. Zeke is a very moody artist with lightening fast changes from anger and rage to fear and isolation. His range of emotion which is always loud and obvious often directs itself at the first available target and the implication is that though by the end of the story he certainly has matured, this tendency to yell first and think second is likely to continue. However, Zeke undeniably has talent and is emotionally fragile due to the tumultuous relationship with his brother Jacky before he died. 
 Miles provides much needed calm and serenity to the outlandish and emotive Zeke, creating complimentary personalities that suit each other even if on first glance they would be more likely to kill each other. Miles' quiet fascination with art and its impact, even while being color blind; lend intensity to the man's personality as well as his interactions with Zeke. His awe of Zeke's talent and growing connection to the man allows for a lot of forgiveness for the more unlikeable aspects of that personality, even if Miles is slow in stopping some unjustified rants. Together these two posses important facets that work well in a passionate relationship, though not always easily. 
 Secondary characters such as Carter and Red are completely wonderful and no doubt will have their own story coming in the future. Red is very interesting in that he acts as an interpreter of Miles for the reader. While Miles is very controlled and precise, Red's internal musings and commentary interpret Miles' real personality versus his projected one down to his needs, wants, and confused feelings for Zeke. Carter is a supportive friend and while he is not exactly necessary to the story, his self imposed isolation contains an alluring aspect that had my attention gravitating towards him during his scenes. I do like a wounded, quietly angst filled man. 
 The character progression and slow maturation of the relationship was a wonderful element to the story, especially considering Zeke and Miles never get sexual until well into the story. However, after that there is no shortage of steamy erotic sex scenes so the author didn't scrimp on that. The third person writing style with changeable point of view worked well and never created any confusion. The prose was tight and clean with hints of humor woven into the dialogue and descriptions. The vitality of art, movement, and emotion created within the writing was felt repeatedly and created an interesting setting for the story. Like I said, I wasn't expecting to get sucked in but I absolutely was. While I didn't appreciate the mystery portion and felt the book would have been better ended at page 200, this isn't enough to stay away from the story. Be sure to check this out! You may groan at the end (or not) but you won't mind it too much."
1,"I devoured the first two pooks in this series. I almost bought this third one but read some reviews first. I then decided to wait on the library and I'm very glad I did. The reviews I read were right on target - no emotion, watching a character watch themselves, same story strung together pointlessly. It's hard for me to believe that the same person wrote this book that wrote the others. Although some people said this was written simply for the sake of fulfilling a contract which I'm inclined to believe. Also, it's not very well researched. The premise is the two main characters go back in time over the years and see their past lives. At one point, the main characters are in Mexico during the height of the Mayan civilization. The author is completely wrong on her history, although what she writes is what the original line of thought was - the Mayans didn't sacrifice the losers, they sacrificed the winners as the ""gods"" wouldn't want the losers. And the pool where the bodies were believed to have been discarded was dredged years ago and no proof of or remains of human sacrifice in the cistern was discovered. This is what I learned from local guides when I toured Chichen Itza in 1999 and had been proven before that. I think the author learned this in her elementary classes (like I did) and never bothered to check to see if it had been changed over the years."

5,"Homecoming by Yaa Gyasi is one of the best books I have read in years. I found myself talking to people about it all day long and recommending it to friends. It came out last year and I saw it on the Popular Reading bookshelf in my library several times before I picked it up. Bad decision on my part. I could have been singing its praises a year ago! 
 Homegoing is a debut novel by a young woman who was born in Ghana and brought to the U.S. by her parents. Gyasi worked on the book for about seven years and was 26 when it was published. The book begins in 18th century Ghana with a woman named Maame,about whom we learn very little. She has two daughters by two different men. One of her daughters, Effia, is cruelly raised and married off to a British man who is running the slave trade in Ghana. The other daughter, Esi, is sold into slavery and sent to the United States. The chapters alternate between the stories of one descendant in each generation -- 14 in all. In fact, some reviewers have described the book as a collection of related short stories -- rather than a novel -- and I can see that characterization. Some of these stories are longer and the characters more fully-realized. However, Gyasi is such a brilliant writer that each character came alive for me, even those whose stories were told the shortest chapters. While most readers love and admire this book, some Goodreads reviewers did not like the number of characters covered in 300 pages. They wanted more complete treatment of the characters and they had trouble keeping track of so many characters. There's a family tree at the front of the book and I kept flipping back and forth to see who begat whom; I can see how someone who missed the family tree (it's also available for the ebook) would be confused. However, I actually loved this technique for telling the stories of two lineages, which collectively and more broadly tells the story of slavery -- both in Ghana and in the U. S. -- and more importantly, the effects of slavery down through the generations. No one is unscathed. 
 Each character occupies a specific place and time. The descendants of Esi travel more widely across the U.S., from the North to the South and back gain but Gyasi tells a number of very unusual stories. She weaves accurate historical detail into her stories. For example, the character only known as H, a descendant of Esi born around 1850, finds himself in jail for talking to a white woman. Soon he is sentenced to 10 years working in a prison mine in Alabama. The convicts are rented to the local mine-owner as inexpensive labor. After ending his prison sentence, H finds work in a coal mine because he has become legendary for his strength and stamina in the pit. In the acknowledgments Gyasi notes her sources for this chapter. Some of these characters are more tragic than others, but all were touched by slavery. Some of these stories are truly heartbreaking, including those who escaped slavery and remained in Ghana. I have my favorite characters, but for me, the sum is greater than the whole of the parts. 
 I believe that the power of Gyasi's book lies in part in its brevity. The reader is left to fill in the untold parts of the stories. Gyasi's book tells specific stories associated with the evil history of slavery, but they are universal stories. I was also repeatedly remind of the role that coincidence plays in all of our lives."
5,"As soon as Ryan was introduced in the first book, I became excited to read his book. He has always been a favourite of mine. And finally its here! And Ms. Wright didn't disappoint, I loved this book and thought it was a great addition to the series. In my opinion, Makenna was Ryan's perfect match and I adored her. On the surface they seem very different, Ryan is a very antisocial gruff guy whereas Makenna is more outgoing and quirky. But when you look deeper they are actually very similar. And I think that was really the beauty of their relationship. You see them and think it just a case of opposites attract but once you look closer you see that they both were hurt very early in life and in their own ways reacted to the hurt by distancing themselves from people. I thought they were really cute, especially whenever Makenna would interpret Ryan's 'grunts' lol 
 I'm also really excited about the loner storyline, it introduced so many new interesting characters and I can't wait to see them in the next books. Very much looking forward to the next book in this series and I highly recommend this one to fans of the series and to anyone who are looking for a new paranormal romance!

5,"I love Patricia Briggs and the Mercedes Thompson series. It was my first introduction to the urban fantasy genre and I've just fallen in love with her writing style and the worlds she creates. This series is super entertaining and full of great characters, kick-butt action, and great twists and turns. I can't wait for her to write more books! 
 ***Content Warning: There's a sex scene. It's mostly vague and pushing the PG-13 limits. Easily skippable, if you so choose."

 Genre: retold fairy tales, fantasy, romance 
 Summary: Princess Ben (short for Benevolence) has lost her family and is at the mercy of the strict and stand-offish Queen Sophia (her aunt). As Ben is the heir apparent, she has to learn how to be a proper princess. In doing so, she grows up, find some new skills and even manages to fall in love. 
 Response: I only gave the book three stars because, while I enjoyed it, it wasn't my favorite experience so far. It felt like the author was trying too hard to use ""big"" words which made the prose more difficult than it had to be. I enjoyed the story, but the book itself didn't wow me speechless or anything. I also felt the ending was a bit rushed and that there could have used a more thorough explanation for why some things turned out the way they did. Like, for instance, the relationship between Ben and her prince Charming, Florian. They spend the majority of the book in open antagonism, yet in the last ten pages of the book, Florian suddenly confesses his love? Why? There was no turning point in their relationship. There was no reason why he should suddenly be so enamoured with her. So that was annoying."
5,"MACKENZIE'S MISSION is the second book in the Mackenzie Family Series. It is the story of Joe Mackenzie, who was sixteen in the first book and is now in his mid-thirties and is now a Colonel in the Air Force. He is in charge of a secret military project. One of the workers on that project is Caroline Evans. Caroline is super smart and because she was always ahead in school, she did not learn to have normal relationships with men. It has made her skittish around men. When she meets Joe, she wants to have a normal relationship for the first time. Just when their relationship seems to be going smoothly, they have to contend with problems on the project that just might be sabotage, and Caroline is the prime suspect. 
 Howard has a winner here. The book is not as good as the original, but it is still darn good. Joe and Caroline are strong willed, independent people. They are sexy together. The story is good and I was compelled to continue turning pages to find out what happened. Howard does such a great job making her characters well defined and strong such that they are unforgettable."
4,"Harry Potter background and info. 
 Rowling finally gives us a few peeks into Harry's world we were never going to see in the novel. The series consist of three small volumes that collect burst of information coupled with Rowling's own thought about the world she created. Ranging from character histories to the in depth workings of the politics of the wizarding word this is a series not to be missed. 
 Short, interesting and a mustread for anny HP fan out there."

 3.5 stars 
 So, I finally finished this book last night. It took just about forever because I had to return it to the library when I was in the middle of it. :( 
 But I'm done it now, and I have to say I really enjoyed it. 
 To be honest, the sole reason I picked this up was because it takes place during Christmas and I really, really wanted to read a Christmassy book. 
 It was different from what I expected, but in a good way. I found the plot to be very unique and intriguing, and I absolutely adored the characters! Not just the main ones though, ALL of them. Dash, Lily, Mark, Boomer, Sophie, Grandpa, Langston, Benny, Alice - each and every one of them! They were all also well developed and I liked the way they all interacted with each other. 
 I also very much enjoyed how the story was told from the alternating view points of both Dash and Lily. It was interesting to see both of their thoughts and feelings about what was going on. 
 And this book was so funny! It had me laughing the whole way through! 
 Also, the book was beautifully written. I definitely wasn't expecting that! Sometimes there'd just be these fantastic quotes about... life? that really just made me think. And I loved that! 
 Additionally, the ending of the story was so cute! It was funny, adorable, and perfect for the story. I often find that contemporary endings are too abrupt, so when a book ends so perfectly like this one did, it makes me really happy! 
 Something I didn't like about this story was how very unrealistic it was. This would NEVER actually happen in real life, and something about that bugged me a little bit. It was almost as if everything worked out a little too perfectly. 
 Also, some scenes were a little bit boring. Even though it is a pretty short book, I feel some things were drawn out and didn't keep me as interested as they could have. 
 And there were some scenes that were just SO weird, and I can't decide if it was a good kind of weird or not. For example, Dash was home alone and randomly decided to walk around his house completely naked. He did all these different things naked, such as eat yogurt. Why? I have absolutely no clue! It was just so bizarre and random... I just don't even know what to think. 
 I think I will probably read the sequel that's coming out sometime this next year. I wonder if it will take place around Christmas again... or maybe it will pick up right after this one left off... or maybe during summer vacation... or spring break...? I don't know, but I'm sure it'll be good either way!"
0,Nope. Can't do this one right now. I need non-depressing books.

 CHEMISTRY SCORE: 6/10 
 It wasn't love at first sight for these two, and Bishop himself recognized this fact. However, in one of the scenes, Bishop admitted that when he first saw Ivy when they were younger, he was immediately fascinated with her. So yes, there was that initial attraction. But they did not act on it right away (or probably had no chance to). 
 Their relationship developed gradually - they started out as acquaintances to friends to more than friends. Both of them aren't really pro-arranged marriages, however they make the most out of everything. When they were thrown in a house together as husband and wife, they found friendship and camaraderie. And fortunately for them, this developed into something more. 
 SIZZLE SCORE: 8/10 
 O my gosh. There were A LOT of swoon worthy scenes, and all of them are my favorite. Bishop's scenes with Ivy are tender and innocent. He is such a gentleman, it's impossible not to fall for him. *sigh* 
 SMOOCH SCORE: 7/10 
 HOTTER THAN MOST YA BOOKS. Bordering on NA, really. Whew. Well, they are married after all."
5,"A mystical beast after a kingdom desperate to protect its dwindling population in not-the-best conditions (poor harvests, etc.)? Talk about tension. 
 This book is exciting and fascinating. With themes of impossible moral choices, unknowable danger, desperate responses, friendship, leadership, and oppression, there's so much going on behind the scenes. The twists are wonderful and surprising. 
 Wendy's voice and engrossing characters lift this story right off the page."
4,"So fun! A great steam punk romp for teenagers, without the overused love triangle trope. I continue to love this author."

3,I think I've been reading too much romantic suspense and anything that isn't sending my stomach into nervous spasms is boring me to death. Or maybe this one just missed the mark for me. I'm hoping it's the latter - I do adore historical romances and I would hate to start losing interest.
4,"this sweet romance by Stephanie Perkins will steal any girls mind and make her want to explore the streets of Paris. 
 the lead character Anna is funny and easy to relate to. i an obviously a sucker for romance & i totally loved the book."
3,"This is a nice quick read. My daughter read it in 30 minutes. It's got some creative ideas and a wonderful fantasy element - it's very other-worldly. And the start is quite moving. I'd give it 4 stars except at times it feels a little flat and contrived. But anyway, it's got a great ending (more sense of wonder) and it feels like things are just getting started. I'll definitely keep reading the series."
3,"HOLY MOLY! A giant asteroid is headed right for Earth! Oh thank heavens, LOOK it's Batman to the rescue! Oh wait, noooooo it's just this doofus. Oops! Well, in my defense, their backstories were nearly identical, but still . . . my bad. Ah but, who can be bothered to save the planet, when there's this pointless little suicide murder to solve. A crime that no one but our intrepid hero seems to give a rat's ass about. 
 Here he comes now, all 6 ft 4, gangly, socially awkward, rumpled suit, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, rookie detective. Sporting this sweet little mustache! But darn if it don't itch like the dickens. 
 Well golly gee, let's get to it. Because even though the world may be ending, and SOON, this here is our boy's dream job. Being an ace detective's all he ever wanted in life, so dagnabbit you can bet your biffy that he's not gonna let a minor little issue like the TOTAL ANNIHILATION of the human race get in the way of him solving this silly homicide. Or was it a suicide? Ah, who gives a crap! What matters is that it's a mystery, and therefore it's worth solving. 
 While it appears that the majority of the populace would rather spend what little time they have left ditching work, fooling around, and getting high as satellites, not our boy. Huh-uh. He's got a job to do, and gosh darn it if he's not gonna give it his all! 
 ----------------------------------------------- 
 And now, a few nagging questions I've just been dying to ask our intrepid hero asshole detective: 
 How many innocent, well . . . maybe not innocent per se, but friendly at least--DANG IT HANK, you've gotta admit that they were some nice folks--how many of 'em had to DIE to satisfy your curiosity? How many lives ruined in the process? How many, Hank? Was solving your little mystery here all that important? You do remember that asteroid is coming don't you, buddy? Wow! I really do hope that your piece of mind was worth such a heavy price . . . DICK!"
4,"I was a little hesitant to pick this up. I've more or less liked all the Ilona Andrews books I've read so far, but none of them was specifically a romance book. And those previous books were right of the border (and occasionally over) the amount of romance I enjoy in a book. It's just not an aspect that grabs me. 
 But weirdly, this book is no more a romance than the other books. Granted, the Edge books are basically romances. But still. It was a needless worry - if you liked the previous, this is in that exact same vein. 
 Nevada Baylor is a detective forced to take a suicide mission. Mad Rogan is an ungodly powerful magic user tasked with helping a family member. Their paths cross at Adam Pierce, a man who can control raging torrents of fire and doesn't much care who he hurts with it. Nevada wants to wrap the case up and stay alive, but Rogan's playing a different game and keeps insinuating himself into her life in a more personal way in addition to the professional. 
 Unfortunately, it also seems that firebrand Adam is interested. 
 With a family to try to keep safe, having these two powerful gents so close is a dangerous proposition, but pushing them away might be moreso. 
 I really like Nevada. She's not my favorite character Andrews has created, but her powerset is unusual and her resoluteness in the face of horrible things and terrifying experiences is realistic to me. Her interactions with her family are also really sweet. 
 And for what it means coming from me, the romance is solid. Boundaries get crossed, but it's clear that that's a bad thing. There's a lot of animal lust involved, and wanting of what people can't have. The attraction is clear, but the logistics are a sticking point that continually makes Nevada step back and think about what she's doing. 
 All in all I found this an enjoyable read and will probably grab the next in the series once it comes out."
3,"I was so overwhelmed with anger on the first half of this book that my initial thoughts were something like this: 
 Screw you, Alex Markov! You are so haughty and mean (a bully!) and you should die a very painful death! 
 And then after a few more pages: 
 Alex, I couldn't take how badly you have treated Daisy. You are a sorry excuse for a hero. You shouldn't be called a hero. You do not even deserved to be called a man. 
 In fact, I decided to write a short letter for him to let him know these dark thoughts: 
 Dear Alex, 
 I really hate you. I'm sorry, I know you're just a fictional character (and it's not your fault that you're written that way), and I'm trying to enjoy this book, but my hatred for you hadn't allowed me to enjoy it. 
 You are a sadistic monster. You dare ask me why? Well, you're always yelling at Daisy, and you didn't believe her when she said a number of times to you that she wasn't the thief who had stolen 
 money from the circus. You also never cease to make her feel stupid and useless all the time. Why do you always doubt Daisy? She tells you the truth and you never believe her. You always assume the worst in her and doesn't trust her. Really, what's wrong with you? 
 Lots of love hate and intense loathing, 
 Julie 
 So there. I almost didn't finish this book. Apart from the infamous Alex (the male lead) which was too hard to like, Daisy (the female lead) was so spineless and too much of a doormat, that I didn't think I can go on any longer. She lets everyone step on her, and I am cringing all the time with all the embarrassment and punishment she took without so much as a complaint. You see, they are a f*cked up combination. 
 But then to some miracle, I was able to forced myself to go on, and when I hit the second half of the book, it gets a tiny bit better. We can see that Alex is starting to care for Daisy, and Daisy slowly starts to grow some backbone (and I mean very slowly - you might not even notice it, but it's there). I began to like her since she was so honest, maybe too naive, but she always believes the good in everyone. 
 Alex was also able to kind of redeem himself (not fully, but I don't dislike him now). He was initially so stern, cynical, and humorless, but we see that he has a playful and mischievous side to him too. When he explained why he is that way (because of his tragic childhood and upbringing), I began to understand him. He was not capable of feeling love to anyone and couldn't have a child, because he could not feel anything at all - not for anyone, not even for a child. I still didn't like all of the things he did to Daisy, but at least there's a reason behind it all. 
 Kiss an Angel was okay, I guess, but one that I would never dare read again."
2,"This started off really well, but then fell apart completely. 
 So we have this couple, and they're desperate to have a baby. They would do literally anything. We see their intense pursuit of this goal. Tension builds as we wonder what risks they're willing to take. What will happen? It's an exploration of passion and wanting. I was beginning to get scared. 
 Then, for some reason, (view spoiler)[ we skip to when the kids are ten years old. (hide spoiler)] Why??? All the tension has now been destroyed, and it's a stupid monster story that doesn't make any sense. The rest of the novel is basically a huge chase sequence. I guess it's not bad action, but it wasn't what I wanted. The psychological aspects of desperation and need completely disappear, and it kind of feels like a rejected Goosebumps book. 
 At the beginning, the writing felt satirical. I chuckled once or twice, and the style worked with the concepts being explored. This style does not work, however, with stereotypical monster action. It just feels stupid and bad. There's nothing thought-provoking to make ironic jokes about, so it just falls flat. 
 It doesn't deal with emotions at all, so it isn't scary. (view spoiler)[ It doesn't discuss the frustration and panic the parents would feel upon realizing their desire to consume their children. (hide spoiler)] It glosses over everything that made the premise sound interesting. 
 In the end, this was not worth my time. If you want a bland monster story, this isn't the worst. On the other hand, if you're intrigued by the premise, just put the book down and back away slowly."
5,Simply fascinating from start to finish! The mystery kept me guessing the whole way through and when I finished I felt the need to go back through and figure out what clues I'd missed the first time around.
5,"Books like Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Saenz make me really jealous of today's young adults. They have access to so many great books that beautifully and perfectly relate to their emotions, thoughts and actions. While listening to Lin-Manuel Miranda read as the book's narrator, Aristotle, there were so many times where I thought back to when I was a teen feeling the way he felt, hell, a lot of what was said in the book I relate to even now. 
 I would definitely recommend this book. It's not action packed with a clear plot line, it's a coming of age story. The characters, especially Dante and Aristotle's parents are so damn lovable and relatable. The audio was perfect, but i am sure it's a great read all on its own too. 5/5"
4,"A bit predictable, as others have said. However, that is the only thing that deterred me from giving this book 5/5 stars. It was great- even better than I expected it to be. I warmed up to Sydney and her POV right away (something I was worried about) and I have to admit that the change in main characters is refreshing. It was interesting and the character interactions were great. I also found that I related to Sydney a lot... quite a bit more than I expected and in different ways than I related to Rose (whom I miss very much, by the way). The last line of the book... AHH! I hope we get to see more of the VA characters in the future. I think Richelle Mead, like with the first two VA books, is warming up readers to the change in perspective and storyline before we hit the ground running with the major plots. I am so excited to read the next book... right now, in fact!"
5,"I wish Showalter didn't give the illusion that these books had anything to do with Alice in Wonderland because that has turned many people off of this series. I make sure to mention this when recommending this series. That being said, I so LOVE this series!! This is the best zombie series I've read. It has just enough romance to keep the characters interesting but plenty of kickass zombie killing scenes for the rest of us. There's plenty of life lessons hidden in the book and disguised enough to not seen like she's preaching to you. Totes amazeballs"
4,"Finally, an adult romance that doesn't make me cringe and actually has some seriously hot sex scenes. Will hit the author's other books immediately!"

3,"Rosemary's Baby has apparently left people unable to sleep at night. I laughed. 
 Rosemary and her husband guy have just moved into a new apartment in a ""haunted"" building. Newly married and ready to take on the world the couple ignore the warnings of a friend and settle into their new home. 
 Rosemary soon falls pregnant and it's then that things start to get odd. Her doctor won't treat her pain and the odd neighbours from down the hall are constantly bringing her drinks that make her feel sick. 
 Rosemary was a naive character but understandably so. She was a young housewife who always turned to Guy to find out what to do in situations. After she fell pregnant though and realised something was wrong and Guy wasn't helping her in the way he should have been she finally came into herself and believed in her ability to do something about her situation. In the end my heart was aching for Rosemary because she got into one of those situations where you can't turn to anyone for help, no one to trust and not too sure of her own sanity. 
 Guy I didn't like from the beginning. He is a self-absorbed actor that came across as one of those people that believe women should be seen and not heard. No matter what concerns Rosemary brought to him about her pregnancy he just brushed her off and told her to trust people that they barely knew. For me he was the most evil character in the entire story because he was Rosemary's husband and the one she should have been able to trust, and yet he was never ever there for her. 
 Rosemary's Baby is very intriguing in its pull. Constantly you are wondering if Rosemary is sane or not. She ends up believing that she has the devils spawn inside of her and really, how plausible is that. Levin wrote the suspense very well in the sense that you don't know until the very end if Rosemary is indeed right in her suspicions. You are constantly second guessing yourself. 
 What I didn't like was the ending; it was silly and felt too abrupt. Rosemary's Baby wasn't scary either, it was suspenseful, but not in a way that you absolutely had to know how it ended. You could kind of guess but what if you were wrong. The only reason I finished it was because I wanted to make sure that I was right. 
 As for being one of the scariest books of all time. It didn't leave me having nightmares or being scared of my weird neighbours. If anything it just added to my mistrust of humans.

2,"Adam is the best father of all times!!! 
 I love his relationship with Blake! 
 The launch scenes were my favorite! I wish I could see more of the Blake and Adam show! 
 I didn't so much like the romance... I couldn't feel the chemistry between the characters and I was very disconnected from Tina. She was very prejudicial and offensive."
5,"I read the whole trilogy one book after the other so it is hard for me to rate them individualy but i will give it a try. 
 I think the second book was my favourite of the trilogy. The dynamics between the characters were at its finest, the strategy and political intrigue at its peak and the ending left a lot to be desired in the third and final book... 
 it is a shame that i didn't rate this book before reading the third book in the trilogy because i would have raved about it!!! but i will talk about the third book and my final rating in King's Rising! i might even post a link when i'm finished!!"
5,"This was another speed read for me. As with all Of Melanie's books, it had heart, humour and a hunk! I have always loved these friends to lovers stories and this was one of those great ones where the guy is supremely inappropriate but hilarious about it and because there was history, the transition to lovers was almost seamless and I was sitting here egging them on the whole way. 
 I loved the development of Miles and Natalie throughout the story and could see very early on that they were truly meant for each other. It was one of those books that you get lost in, wanting to see the happily ever after you know is at the end but without a clue how to get there."
3,"Continuing from The Gunslinger, Roland now finds himself doors that can transport his mind into the body of others. The first door led him to an Italian junkie named Eddie Dean, who is proven to be full of trivia when sober, the second door led to Odetta Holmes who is an African American woman with split personalities. The last door led to a sociopath called Jack Mort who has caused grief to everyone. 
 It was very hard to get into but once Odetta appeared it was quite fun to read. First of all she is in a wheelchair. Secondly, one personality is normal but timid, the other is called Deta Walker, a dindu from ghetto who steals, swears and is violent. I can picture King writing it to make it the most racist thing he's ever written. I just burst out laughing at how this woman in a wheel can move very fast and steal, the image is priceless. King even described her as a ""cartoon-ish black woman"", I cracked up every time she says something unintelligent. But other than this character, the story made little sense and was longer than it should have been."
4,"I really enjoyed this book for the way it took on generational pain and the way it affects those involved. The third person omniscient narrative really helped create the atmosphere too. 
 The weakest parts were some of the correspondence between Sasha and Ray, as well as the ending, sadly, which felt a bit rushed in mood. Definitely a book I'd recommend to readers interested in family dramas."
3,I'm actually a bit disappointed with the sequel. Maybe because I loved the first book and I kinda have higher expectation for the second. It dragged too much on Sophia and Neil's relationship where I feel like slapping them both especially Sophia for being childish.(Sometimes some characters just makes me want to be violent.). But it was still an enjoyable read though.
4,"Actual rating: 4.5 stars. The writing style and, well, the book itself reminded me of Alice in Wonderland. Except this is...better. I hated the Lewis Carroll books, but I loved this book. The story's much more linear and sensical, but it still has so much whimsy. The characters are so much fun and I can't wait to read the sequel. The only thing I had a problem with was the time difference. (view spoiler)[If September is forced to come back every season, does that mean every season in Fairyland or every season on Earth? If it's the former, doesn't that mean she'll be leaving for Fairyland very frequently? If it's the latter, won't everyone be dead by the time she comes back? (hide spoiler)]"
4,enchanting and beautifully written.
4,"To be honest, I was one of those who didn't like The Girl On The Train. But with Into The Water, Paula Hawkins has shown me her brilliant cinematic writing. I now understand why she got her first book adapted into a movie so easily. 
 Into The Water transports us into the mysterious deaths of young girls in the Drowning Pool, a name of a river in Northumberland. The young girls' deaths has a pattern of The Roanoke Girls. But when you start this novel, the author wanted it to be shocking, and it was. We gradually get introduced to our narrator Jules who came back in the town after her sister's suicide. 
 Full review on Bookidote 
 Each character has their own perspective, creating their own rivers and flows until one day, in the end, everything converges in a confluence. And in this book, I actually felt the fast pacing of suspense and that feeling of beating hearts. That's when you know you read a good thriller book. 
 The only reason why I wouldn't give it a 5 stars is the 11 narrators... yup, that can be confusing (but she succeeds to implement an element of suspense and keeps us on hold just fine) and the not so mind-blowing plot. But that's very personal in my reviews haha I always expect the stories to be as creative and imaginative as possible. This is the kind of book you'll love as a reading experience but when it's finished you'll be asking yourself...okay that's it? That's it. It's quite simple. BUT The little twists in between the story? They're genius. 
 A lot of the critics say that this one is a let down from The Girl On The Train. In my opinion, The Girl On The Train was not even at the same podium as this one. The subtleties were more spot on and her writing, definitely more refined. 
 Thank you to Penguin Random House for giving me a free copy to review!

0,"I don't think I can write a review that adequately reflects how amazing The Hate U Give is. This book is so important and comes at such a needed time. Black Lives Matter and this book expresses that so well. 
 I laughed, I cried, and I fell in love with Starr and her family. I got angry at the way Khalil was treated, especially when the officer's father went on live TV and painted his son as the victim. We see this too many times in real life: an officer shoots a Black person, and then the media and white people spin it so the officer is the victim. The officer is NEVER the victim. Full stop. We need to recognize that Black lives matter, too, and stand up for them. 
 I strongly urge everybody to read The Hate U Give and think about the way America and white people treat Black people.

5,"""Do you know what's scarier than taking a risk and losing?"" 
 I shook my head. 
 ""Regret, Joss. Regret does awful things to a person."" 
 Um, who wouldn't want to move to Scotland to go to school and listen to all those incredibly sexy accents? Oh, sign me up! I love that this book is based in Scotland and written by a Scot as well. I couldn't help read all of Braden's line with an accent. *Sigh* Aside from the amazingly hot sex in this book, it was very funny and I enjoyed it from start to finish. Braden is to die for with a charming personality and quite the sex drive and all he wants in Jocelyn. I could see how someone could get frustrated with Jocelyn. If anyone has read The Opportunist, I could totally see Olivia in Jocelyn. She didn't want to let Braden in and was completely comfortable avoiding any kind of meaningful relationship with him. It seems unusual to read a book where a guy chases more than the girl does but if you have to have a guy chasing you, it doesn't get much better than Braden! (view spoiler)[ When Ellie found out about her tumor and Jocelyn got out of there. I was disappointed that she left but I understood where she was coming from. I also have this desire to not get close to people for fear of loss or a strong emotional connection. I get it. But it still wasn't appropriate for the situation and I think she eventually realized it. Braden hurt deeply from that and even more so from her breaking up with him. More on that later. (hide spoiler)] I think that Braden didn't know how he was going to get Joss and the best idea he had was to turn up the flirting. However, it seemed that every time Joss rejected Braden he ended up with a new girl or going on a date. This is the wake call that pushed Joss to agree to the proposal Braden made to her. I found that Joss acted almost like a guy while participating in their friends with benefits relationship. If at any point he started getting too intimate with her she tried to steer him back to sex. I truly believe he used this proposal in order to try to trick her into a relationship. Take this quote for example: 
 ""We fuck, we have fun, and then we spoon. I don't go home. I don't go home because sometimes in the middle of the night I wake up, and when I wake up, I want to fuck. And for some baffling reason, the person I want to fuck is you."" 
 Braden is a guy who knows what he wants without a doubt and it seems that he stops at nothing to get what he wants. I think he is generally not used to hearing no and is taken back someone telling him to him needed to move on because he wasn't going to get anywhere with her. He is seriously funny and so possessive and sexy. I love him. (view spoiler)[ I was devastated for him when she broke with him and didn't know how the hell things were going to work out. When he confronted her in the kitchen and was being a total ass to her I was so taken back. He was obviously hurting deeply and covering his hurt with anger that was projected on Joss in a painful way. When he said that he had sex with someone right after they broke up the night before, I was in shock. Two things came to mind: first, I could totally see Braden doing it since he jumps from girl to girl and second, what an asshole. He just totally gutted her, she was completely and utterly beside herself. I ached for her. I was so hurt I wanted to throw my kindle. And he just watched her reaction. I wasn't exactly sure what he was doing and then I was relieved that he was testing her and wanted to see if she did love him and care for him. I really thought they were going to get back together right then but freaking Joss cannot make up her mind. (hide spoiler)] 
 This book was such a pleasure and I absolutely loved it. If you like Alpha males who like to spoon like I do, this is the book for you.

3,"3.5 
 I would've given it a 4 but idk some parts were kinda unrealistic, especially the fantasy bits. A lot of it didn't really mesh well and there were some contradictions and the author pulled a deux ex machina a couple of times. Overall, a lot of the high school drama could've been written out but then again it was really really really cute and it's one of my fave books because the two main characters were absolutely adorable and I just wish the plot had been less messier. I feel like the next book would be better because the ending was a clear lead in and maybe it would be more focused on the whole fantasy bit than the urban part of the book since we have a good idea of the characters. But my issues with the plot aside, I want a David really badly."
0,"well, that was a mess"
4,Read this to my girls. Not sure of the dates.
1,sorry to say i found this one boring. I will be trying somethin' else.
4,I am obsessed with this series!
4,"Kaleidoscope was actually pretty good. The 4-star rating was just because when I turned the page and saw Epilogue, I had a little jaw-dropping-eyes-wide-open moment because I wasn't expecting it yet. And the book didn't have that explosive climax that I have always gotten from KA books before and I was expecting it throughout the story considering this was Deck's story. I've always looked forward to reading his book since reading Breathe. I still liked it a lot though. But now, I really, really, really need Frankie and Benny's story! Really."
4,"I loved this book! I could not put it down! I found myself reading through meals, reading while brushing my teeth, reading in parking lots, and reading late into the night long after I should have been asleep. I have been looking for a paranormal romance/urban fantasy series to take the place of the Anita Blake series in my life...but that disaster is a story for a different day. I think I may have found that series with the Guild Hunter Series. 
 First we have our two main characters, archangel Raphael and guild hunter Elena. I liked them both. Raphael has this air about him that is dark, scary, and dangerous. But at the same time it is so enticing. I wanted to know about him and I wanted to know what he was capable of. Elena is similarly dark, scary, and dangerous. But that was interesting and enticing too. What really amused me was that through the entire book Elena keeps insisting about how different they are, when they are actually strikingly similar. The sexual tension between the two of them was a constant tease through this entire book. After awhile I wanted to just scream at them, ""seriously just do it already!"" When they did, it was passionate and sensual and such a relief. It was about time and it was a great scene. 
 The idea behind this plot was simply fascinating. It was something that I never would have thought of, and I found that refreshing. Angels are the ones creating vampires, very unique. Angels have the ability to turn into blood sucking monsters and kill hundreds, also unique and fascinating. So many elements of this story were unique for this genre and it was so excellent to read. I have been craving something I've never read before in the paranormal realm and I finally found it. 
 The only complaint I could possibly make is that there was so much going on that, at times, I had trouble keeping track of everything. So many things were left unexplained until the very end that they melded together in mind and occasionally I found myself confused. But this was a minor setback and ultimately didn't diminish my enjoyment of the story at all. I cannot wait to move on to the next in the series, and I look forward to finding out what's going on with Elena next. The hole in my paranormal fantasy shelf is filled and I couldn't be more excited to watch it evolve. 
 This was a solid 4.5 out of 5."
4,"I'm really fond of the gossip element of this novel - the interviews with different parents who all have different things to say. To see how a happening can be twisted when told from person to person. A lot of suspense was added when they referred to the death, to the suspected murder... and you never knew who the victim was. Is it Jane? Celeste? Madeline? Who is it? 
 An engaging novel that made me real furious at times. Better than The Husband's Secret... or at least my memory of that novel."
4,that twas cute
3,"I loved the monsters in this book. The were terrifying, and all held something real inside them- something that marked them as monsters that could appear in our world. But I did not love the characters. I did not like the romance. The plot was interesting, but it all fell apart after Edie used her first wish. The world-building wasn't as strongly structured as I would have liked- a lot of things confused me but weren't very clearly explained even when they were elaborated on very late in the book. So I basically swam in my own confusion for almost the entire novel. But overall, the horror theme in this novel is bone-chilling and amazing."
5,"I AM SPEECHLESS AND OVERWHELMED AND I JUST GOD, I NEED A MOMENT TO JUST COME BACK TO MYSELF. 
 REVIEW TO COME. SOON."
5,"Language: No 
 Sex: No 
 Drugs: No 
 Violence: None unless you consider tree kicking a violent act. 
 Sadness: Yes 
 Almost indescribable bliss: Yes 
 What a wonderful novel! This is a joyful read that any tween or teen girl would enjoy. Hannigan's beautiful prose and youthful discover of the grief cycle holds its own among the many cancer stories available today."
5,"One of the best books i ever read:) I was always a fan of witch and vampire stories but the whole dec 21 2012 thing made it even better! And don't worry, if you don't like sparkling vampires Laylen, the vampire in this book doesn't sparkle( at least i dont think he does.) i recomend this book to everyone it's amazing!"
5,"This book had been fantastabulous to read! 
 It was more adventurous than the other two books in the series! This book had EVEN more surprising events . 
 There were many names/words that are SWEDISH: 
 - OREN ( name of the cruel king who ruled Vittra kingdom): UNCLEAN 
 - VITTRA ( kingdom ruled by Oren): CRUMBLE 
 - ONDARIKE ( capital of Vitrra kingdom): EVIL EMPIRE 
 - MANSKLIG ( host human's babies who were switched ): HUMAN (verb) 
 - FORENING ( capital of Trylle kingdom):COMPOUND 
 - SKOJARE ( another troll kingdom): PEOPLE WHO JOKES 
 NOTE: Those words are not my translation, I can not even count or say a simple ""hello"" in Swedish 
 The main character in this book is Wendy Everly ( a princess who loved Loki, a member of the opponent kingdom. She also loved Finn, a lower-position tracker in her kingdom AND she had to marry a guy named Tove, who didn't love her because he was interested in guys) 
 - Wendy was a troll who was switched at birth when she was as a changeling to live with a human host family. It was to keep her safe from her cruel father who was the king of Vittra kingdom that wanted to keep her for himself. When Wendy was old enough, a special tracker found her and brought her back to her kingdom like every other changeling. Wendy was the daughter of the Trylle Queen, therefore she was crowned as a princess. She faced different circumstances as a princess! She was even struggling with her love life. 
 My hypothesis before reading this book: 
 - Wendy & Finn: definitely 
 - Wendy & Loki: uh, maybe ~ 
 - Wendy & Tove: oh please, just please, NO WAY! 
 - Wendy & Elora: motherhood will increase 
 - Wendy & Matt: always sister and brother 
 - Wendy & Willa: still best friend 
 - Wendy & Duncan: princess and a guard 
 - Wendy & Aurora: no special relationship 
 The conclusion after I finished this book: 
 (view spoiler)[ 
 - Wendy & Finn: best friend 
 - Wendy & Loki: husband and wife 
 - Wendy & Tove: best friend 
 - Wendy & Elora: motherhood increased 
 - Wendy & Matt: always sister and brother 
 - Wendy & Willa: still best friend 
 - Wendy & Duncan: princess and a guard 
 - Wendy & Aurora: okay ex-mother-in-law and ex-bride

4,"This book is legitimately one of the most fascinating books I've read in the past decade. Flynn deals with the pop-culture aspect of true crime, the idea of sociopathy and how it differs from psychopathy, and toxic relationships, all the while weaving a fascinating, complicated mystery of a plot. Flynn doesn't lose the threads she's picked, and she doesn't drop narrative voice for a moment. She also succeeds where others have fallen so, so short, and has distinct, different voices for Nick and Amy. 
 Reading Gone Girl made me want to sit down with Gillian Flynn and discuss unsolved homicides and disappearances from the past century, and maybe see if she'd like to break out the Robert Stack and chill for a while. It also showed that Flynn has a knack for psychology that few modern authors do. Her characters seemed effortless--not just Nick and Amy, but the whole cast of background characters, as well. The combination of carefully crafted plot and compelling, realistic characters had me reluctant to put down the book long enough to do things like eat. 
 Gillian Flynn may have done what I thought impossible: Made me enjoy without second thought a book about horrible people doing horrible things to each other. But that's not to say there weren't things I didn't like. 
 Where this book lost points with me is with the ending (although I was given minor spoilers for the ending, and we'll discuss this in a minute), and with some of the word choices. As far as the latter goes, my beef isn't so much that Flynn uses vulgarity and cursing as the frequency with which her characters do so by the end of the book. It was never enough to be outright jarring, but particularly the use of the C-word had me cringing back. I'm not someone who thinks you shouldn't use the words that best convey what you're trying to write, but after more than half the book with nothing worse than the occasional f-bomb and ""dumb bitch,"" it seemed to escalate so quickly. I am certain it was done deliberately to reveal to the reader the true nature of Amy, but. Especially the first few instances left a bad taste in my mouth. 
 As to the ending, I was gently spoiled for a broad brushstroke of the ending before I picked up the book. (view spoiler)[I knew Nick and Amy ended up back together, which means I also knew (and had guessed before I was spoiled) that Amy was not dead. I actually wasn't disappointed with that ending. It seems fitting that the spiral continues until everyone is so entwined you can't see the spiral at all. What I was disappointed with was that there was no real resolution for Rhonda Boney. I didn't even realize Rhonda was the one I was rooting for until I finished the book and discovered she never got her answers, and she probably never will. I mean, I'd like to think of her doggedly hunting down every lead she could until she finally, finally catches a break, but in the world Flynn has created, that's not something that's likely to happen without Nick's help. It's not enough of a flaw to spoil the entire book for me, but it's enough of one to knock off half a star. 
 So, pretty solid three and a half stars, here. Excellent writing, amazing (heh) characterizations, and a fitting end for our lead couple. (hide spoiler)]"

4,"This book is a wild ride. It's 1914, an era where women are expected to stay home and take care of the family. Already, the Kopp sisters are an anomaly--rather than move in with their brother, Francis, they opt to live on their own on the family farm following their mother's passing. And they do quite well for themselves, thank you very much. 
 They're skilled at isolation, until an automobile runs into their buggy on the road. A simple request for payment for damages spirals into threatening letters from the driver, visits to the police station, and the sisters learning how to use a revolver in self-defense. Constance Kopp finds herself traveling around New Jersey and New York, gathering whatever information she can to make sure this well-to-do menace is put in jail. 
 The Kopp sisters aren't your average turn-of-the-century women, and from the start you love their brash and seemingly unladylike personalities. The best part? This all happened, and Constance ultimately became one of America's first female deputy sheriffs. Now that's the kind of history I'm interested in. They don't hide the fact they're unmarried, and they don't pretend they want to be anything but who they are. Even when men are shooting at their house and throwing bricks through windows, they don't even consider moving in with their brother--the ""man of the house""--because they can protect themselves. It's women like these who paved the way for the rest of us. 
 Also: Kudos to the cover artist, because this book is gorgeous."
5,"Okay first off I have to reveal I LOVE Josephine Myles, she is an autobuy author for me and I have loved everything I've ever read from her. Her characters are solid and real, there's usually some humor and some heart, and no matter how short or long the story, it's always well-done. 
 I have read nearly every one of her books, and recently decided to get rid of the ""nearly"" and catch up with a couple I had just never got around to reading yet. 
 Tailor Made was one of these books, and as usual it was fantastic. I personally enjoyed this one a little more though, because I was an art student (too many moons ago). I chose graphics rather than painting or fine arts (so thank GOD I never (view spoiler)[ had to mix up fake poo and roll around in it! LOL (hide spoiler)]) but it still took me back. 
 I loved Felix, he was cheeky and obnoxiously flirty but he had another dimension to him underneath, he wasn't one-dimensional. I loved how good he was with Andrew, who was ""less experienced."""
3,"The book loses two stars for severe revisionism issues, but it's definitely not without its merit, and quite well-written, so it's not entirely a lost cause."
4,"This is all the Batgirl I've ever read so I can't compare it to anything else. On its own, despite being a bit confusing in the middle, it was really fun."
5,"Once again, Ilona and Gordon, the husband and wife team behind the pseudonym Ilona Andrews, have knocked it out of the ball park. Magic Rises is the sixth book in the action-packed, urban fantasy series that focuses on Kate Daniels, a warrior living in a world where the balance between magic and tech is unstable. Kate's magical blood makes her powerful, yet vulnerable to her fratricidal father. Fortunately, she has the backing of her pack courtesy of her role as mate to Currran, The Beast Lord and ruler of the Atlanta shape shifters. 
 In Magic Rises, Kate and Curran travel to unfriendly European pack territory to protect a pregnant werewolf and moderate in the resulting paternal dispute (yes, I mean paternal rather than paternity - a dispute of fathers, if you will). Recognizing it for the trap that it is, the alpha couple and a team of their trusted pack members assume the risk to acquire Panacea from the European packs, a rare substance that can save the lives of adolescent shifters, preventing them from the insanity of loupism and the death sentence it carries. The danger far exceeds their expectations, threatening not just the lives of their contingent, but also their loyalties and the mate bond between Kate and Curran. 
 This book is chock full of page-turning, edge-of-your-seat, high intensity action and adventure. Gordon and Ilona produce such wonderfully written battle scenes that I often found myself holding my breath while reading them. There are several such scenes included in Magic Rises and it is hard to choose just one that is more memorable. That is not going to stop me from admitting that the ""sparring"" match between Kate and Hugh not only captivated me, but also awakened a blood-thirsty inner voice that kept chanting, ""Kill him, Kate! Cut that smug expression right off of his rotten little face!"" Who knew I possessed such blood lust? (Um, ok, probably everyone, being that I am Darth and all.) 
 I am sure that if anyone was around to witness my reading reactions, they would think I was a total lunatic. I laughed out loud, I gasped, I may or may not have cried a little, and I surely started to turn blue in the face from holding my breath. I found myself obsessively compelled to get in just one more page (I might even have snuck in a few page or two while stopped at traffic lights). I just could not put it down, I needed to know what was going to happen to some of my favorite characters next. 
 The complexity of these characters deepens even further in Magic Rises. At the same time that she struggles with her esteem as an alpha who is not a shifter, Kate reveals just how much of an alpha she truly is. Her heart is breaking, and yet she continues to put the pack above herself time and again. (Not killing Hugh, trying to make sure Derek does not feel divided loyalty between her and Curran, and carrying on with the assignment). Curran, who we already know is a total alpha (hello, Beast Lord, here), further demonstrates his leadership abilities, despite his worry about Kate (we'll get to that in a minute). All of the shifters in the book displayed a depth of devotion and furvor to protect their own, but none more so than Aunt B, who has long been one of my favorite characters in the series. I wish I could tell you more, but better to let you read it on your own. 
 Romantic relationships in non-romance series often grow either stale or silly after so many books. Ilona and Gordon keep this fire burning bright without sacrificing the emotional intelligence of their characters. The razor sharp tension between Kate and Curran fits within the context the plot without changing the essence of the characters themselves. I like the fact the fact that Curran is not apologetic about the fact that yes, he was an ass. However, he had come to terms with the decision that he'd risk losing Kate's love rather than losing her life. In the end, she is forced to admit she'd do the same. Once again, it the is alpha in both of them. 
 Of course, no Kate Daniels book would be complete without a plethora of snarktastic fun, and Magic Rises certainly rises to the occasion. (See what I did there?) The banter is well-written and leaves me grinning like a loon. I think a lot of authors struggle with dialog, trying too hard to convey too much information in stilted exchanges between characters. Meanwhile, Gordon and Ilona make witty dialog seem effortless. They convey so much about personalities, relationships, and plots in just a few, often humorous, words, such as ""Dear God, the cookie was poisoned."" (Upon reading, I hooted with laughter.) 
 Another aspect of this book, and the series as a whole, that sets it apart is that while there is a clear plot arc across books, each books has a fully developed and COMPLETED plot line. Some higher profile fantasy authors could take note (ahem, GRRM). I not only enjoyed the adventure, but I felt satisfied at the end. Not so satisfied that I won't buy the next book on its release date just as I did with Magic Rises. 
 If for some reason, you have not yet started on this series, I cannot urge you enough to jump on in. This is really solid urban fantasy writing. The world-building is phenomenal, the action is exciting, and it is all accomplished with a wry sense of humor. For those of you who know and love this series, I'll be waiting for you to finish Magic Rises over on the I-can't-wait-for-Magic Breaks couch."
5,"When I originally read Gillian Flynn's statement that this was one of the best books she's read this century, I balked. After about 10 pages into the novel, though, I realized what she was talking about and I agree completely. I loved this novel so very much. 
 Kate Atkinson has a uniquely transcendent way of writing about the human existence. While I'm not quite sure that there was a reason, within the context of the novel, why Ursula kept being reborn into different versions of her same life, it didn't really matter because it worked so well. Without becoming didactic or repetitive, Atkinson's novel fully illuminated the impact our choices have on our destiny and the destiny of those around us. I was never bored and I never found the novel repetitive, even when Ursula had been reborn at least 5 times within twenty pages. 
 Because many of the details from each reality didn't change, and as a reader you came to expect certain characters and events to play out in a specific way, there was a heightened sense of suspense throughout, which really kept the plot moving. On top of this, Atkinson really created believable, purely human characters that I only wanted to spend more time with as the novel progressed. I found it remarkable that each of Atkinson's characters carried the same personality with them through all of the different realities. E.g. Maurice was always the awful, self-centered, and pompous brother that everyone hated. I don't think the novel would have been as tight as it was if this hadn't been the case for each of Ursula's family members. 
 Each of Ursula's deaths was quite different from the rest, some tragic, some expected, and some purely quiet. The scenes about the London blitz and the bombing of Germany were remarkably alive and compelling. My heart was at the same time broken and revived, because of the beauty and terror of Atkinson's writing. Read this book as soon as you can. It's worth it."
3,I would have liked this book so much more if it weren't for some of the totally needless gore that Pullman threw into the book.
5,"This is the 1st book in the Charlie Bone series. 
 Charlie Bone has a special gift- he can hear people in photographs talking! 
 The fabulous powers of the Red King were passed down through his descendants, after turning up quite unexpectedly, in someone who had no idea where they came from. This is what happened to Charlie Bone, and to some of the children he met behind the grim, gray walls of Bloor's Academy. 
 I got this book years ago and reread it maaaany times but i still love it :) 
 It's about Charlie Bone, a normal boy, until he discovers that he can hear the people in pictures. 
 His relatives send him to the Bloor Academy, a school for talented people and for children like Charlie, gifted with talking to animals, mindreading, telekinese, controlling the weather and more. 
 But he weill soon discover that the school has lots of dark secrets... and he and and his new friends try to discover it, one of them: what happened to Charlie's dad, who vanished many years ago...? 
 It has some similarites to the Harry Potter books. 
 I know this series targets teenagers, but i would also recommend it to ""older"" people :) 
 It's easy to read and the storys are good, surprising, full of friendships, difficulties, lots of magic, secrets, great characters(good and evil), evil teachers and a king with magical abilites who died 1000 years ago... or did he? :) 
 What you get: a creepy school with many secrets; talking photographs; a stolen child; a house full of music; red, orange and yellow cats; an invisible hero, who likes jam and and a king, who is a tree :)"
4,"Reading felt rather peculiar. I couldn't put my finger on it at first - I thought it was the writing style that was weird but actually it was the whole system. And I actually get it. The reason why it seemed off was because the point of view's not what I am accustomed to as far as fantasy novels are concerned. It's unique and really interesting, honestly. 
 The story line of the indie kids was a bit confusing though. Aren't the enemies already immortal? (1. they're called the Immortals 2. they're called the Immortals) So I don't get why they need human (mortal) bodies as ""permanent"" vessels. Well, whatever, the indie kids aren't the protagonists anyway. 
 You'd think when comparing both plots, the indie kids would win because they're through more exciting stuff, but that is not the case at all for me. Sometimes ordinary is more extraordinary than the extraordinary. 
 I learned that thinking you're the least wanted is a waste of time, because thinking that makes you downright wrong. The book is worth it, that's for sure."
5,"I love Amy Poehler. I was introduced to her through Parks & Rec, which is one of my all-time favorite shows, so when I saw that Amy had written a memoir, I added it to the ""to read"" list. It was sitting there for quite some time. But I'm so glad I've finally made my way through it, and I'm even more happy that I listened to it on audio. I absolutely recommend the audio version. Amy reads it herself, and you get so much more of her personality and humor when you're listening. The first audiobook I've really loved. 
 I laughed. I cried. I related to Amy in so many ways. It's the little things that really made the book hit home for me. Realizing that Amy, too, sucks at sleeping. Like, I get you, girl! I feel you on that wavelength! And all the talk of Parks & Rec. I just really, truly enjoyed this book. If you're a fan of Amy Poehler, then absolutely read Yes Please. Actually, listen to Yes Please. It's wonderful."
3,"This volume contains two stories - the first being a shorter story with the continuing adventures of Bufkin in Oz, which was an ok story, though I really didn't like the art. 
 The second is the titular story, and happens concurrently with the events of Fables, Vol. 18: Cubs in Toyland. Bigby tags up with Stinky, much against his will, in order to try and track down the cubs. We see a bit of this, and travel through some interesting dimensions, but this is sort of just a side plot. The real focus is on Snow who is bothered by a, shall we say, past wooer - Prince Brandish. 
 Brandish is a giant douche, and I mean of monumental proportions. He's still living in the dark ages, and I think part of the reason I didn't enjoy this story that much is because he just irritated me so much. 
 I mean, he's meant to be annoying, but, damn... 
 I also didn't like that Snow seemed way too much a damsel in distress for the first part of the story. In the end she kicks some ass, risking much in the process, which was nice 'cause, honestly, I was gonna be kinda pissed if Snow became all weak-willed all of a sudden... 
 But the real kicker comes with the ending. I mean - (view spoiler)[Bigby dead? (hide spoiler)] It can't be! And it probably won't be, because, ya know, fairy-tales, and they totally left it open to be fixed. But, yeah... I'm wondering how long they'll drag this out. :-/ 
 Anyway - 
 The denouement of the story ends with the same scene as Vol. 18, so we're all caught up now, and I assume the next volume will move forward, but I guess we'll see."
4,"You know, I thoroughly agree with previous reviewer Khahn. As I read her review, I keep thinking, ""I KNOW!"" But still, I enjoyed the read. I don't know why - I just did."
2,"This review also appears on my blog, Adrift on Vulcan. 
 One of my most anticipated reads of the year, I was increasingly disappointed when the average rating for Tumble & Fall began dropping lower and lower and lower as its release date neared. Now I can admit that though Alexandra Coutts' debut was a lyrical and beautiful novel, it was somewhat meaningless, and even now, I have no idea what the whole point of the book was. 
 SUMMARY: When news reaches the world that a huge asteroid, nicknamed Persephone, is on a collision course set straight for Earth, surprisingly nothing much changes. Nobody goes to work or school, but stays home to spend what's left of their time with their families, silently preparing for the unavoidable disaster. Sienna is a girl struggling to find herself. Zan is trying to get over the loss of her boyfriend. And Caden is pent-up with anger, and wants nothing more than for his family to be whole again. But will they find what they're looking for before the world ends? 
 Tumble & Fall's strongest point lay, without a doubt, in Coutts gorgeous writing. Even though the book may have failed in other areas for me, the writing was definitely one that I enjoyed immensely. Read this: 
 ""It's funny to think about endings now. Now that all there is to do is wait. Now that the real ending is coming, all of the other endings feel like something else completely. All of the goodbyes, and leaving the people she loved. The people she loved leaving her. They felt like endings at the time. But the next day, she had gotten out of bed, and maybe there was a hollow pit where her stomach used to be, maybe she didn't feel like eating or talking or seeing people for a while, but mostly, things stayed the same."" 
 To make the experience even more magical, read that passage out in a soft and dramatic voice. BOOM. Beautiful. However, in terms of narration, I found it a little harder to get used to the writing style. The entire book is written in third person present tense, and while I'm used to third person narrations as well as present tense ones, I'm not used to the both of them combined. But it turned out that this style of narration worked really well for the book. 
 But that, unfortunately, is where all the good things about Tumble & Fall ends. Maybe it had something to do with my expectations, because what I got was not what I was looking for -- and not in a good way. I think I was looking for something more to do with the asteroid, and the fact that Earth is ending in just days, and maybe how these three teenagers the synopsis mentions cope with it, and the things they do about it. What actually went down is the ordinary lives of three somewhat normal teenagers. Don't get me wrong -- I had absolutely nothing against this. I suppose I wanted more. More about Persephone, more about the chaos than of their lives. 
 That in itself didn't make the book a less-than-enjoyable read, though. Coutts switches from three perspectives to tell their stories, and truthfully, I felt that that made it all the harder to connect with any of them. If that wasn't already bad, the fact that Sienna, Zan, and Cadens' voices all sounded too similar to be distinguishable put the final nail in the coffin. And this book is the kind of story that is very much character-driven, in my opinion, so it came as a huge disappointment when none of the characters particularly stood out to me, turning what could have been a hopeful, depressing, emotional story into something bland, and more often than not, boring. 
 THIS PARAGRAPH CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE ENDING 
 (view spoiler)[Another thing that was possibly more dissatisfying than any of the above was the ending. Maybe I had my priorities wrong, but I'm sure a lot of people going into this book had a similar goal in mind: would Earth get hit by that asteroid? At least, that was what I was looking forward to reading about, so when the ending rolled around in all its open-ended glory (I just ruined it for you, I'm sorry), needless to say, I was angry. I mean, the asteroid and the outcome is one of the aspects of the book too. All the stories revolved around Persephone, somewhat, so I really wished that the author had ended with something definite. (hide spoiler)] 
 END OF PARAGRAPH 
 All in all, while not the worst book in existence, Tumble & Fall was definitely far from perfect. Despite the poor characterization and story-telling, and the disappointing ending though, I did not hate Coutts' debut. I think the author has much potential -- especially with such skilled writing like hers -- so I hope to see more improvement from her in the future. Right now, though, if you're thinking of reading this book, I would suggest borrowing it from the library! 
 Who is this book for? 
 Anyone wanting to read this book should go in NOT with science fiction in their minds, but of contemporary. That way I think you'd have much better luck than I did!

4,Challenge: Read a book with a nonhuman character
4,"I was hesitant to start this book because I really didn't like the Twilight books at all. I was pleasantly surprised with this book, however. 
 The world has been taken over by aliens or ""souls"" who are implanted into the brains of humans and gradually take over until the human mind fades out of existence. The aliens take over because they think that the human race is extremely violent and could benefit form their influence. Melanie Stryder has been taken over by a soul called ""Wanderer,"" but refuses to fade away. The story is mostly told from the Wanderer's point of view, with some interludes from Melanie. At first Melanie's relationship with Wanderer is strained. They dislike and resent each other and are trying to force each other out. Eventually, the two begin to understand each other and form a sort of friendship. The Wanderer and Melanie set out in search of Jared, the man Melanie loves, and the Wanderer begins to also develop feelings for him. They hook up with a band of people in hiding, resisting the alien take-over. At first the people are afraid of Wanderer/Melanie, and take her in as a sort of prisoner. Slowly, she begins to win them over, however, and the story line develops from there. I really enjoyed this book!"
4,"I just love this series! It keeps me guessing - which isn't always easy for me since I love mysteries and crime stories so much - but this one is just cute and light and fun! This one just felt so much like a sprint - emily going off, hanna in the hospital and then a party! Just so much sprinting and not a lot of time spent just with the girls hanging out. 
 that's okay, face paced quick fluffy read."
1,"Came in 9th on list at GoodReads for favorite novel of the year 2011. received 1827 votes. 
 Madeleine Hanna, dutiful English major, is writing her senior thesis on Jane Austen and George Eliot, purveyors of the marriage plot that lies at the heart of the greatest English novels. 
 - The Marriage Plot 
 Well, I am 95 pages in, and I am not hearing a lot about Jane Austen and George Eliot. I guess that's because Madeleine has decided that these authors are not ""cool"" enough, especially with the other students. Instead, her interests shift, and I'm reading a lot about Derrida, Lyotard, Foucault, Deleuze, Baudrillard, Handke, Blanchot... 
 I now know way more about Semiotics then I ever wanted to."
4,"While I had originally thought the android was Iko in her early years (c'mon, that would have been great!) I still appreciated reading Star's story. Imagining how trapped she must feel... to feel so human yet know you never will be... it gave me so much more sympathy for Iko and others like her. However, while I do wish this novella had a happier ending for Star, I'm glad for how it did finish - as heart breaking as Star's final moments were :'("
5,"I stayed up all night to finish this and I put the work I had to do at hold because Rush was the only things that was on mind and I couldnt focus on anything else even after I tried.Maya Banks is a great author, I love her books and this wasnt an exception. 
 I finally found a book that it was worth my time and money after reading some less than the average books. 
 The story was good and had everything a girl can ask in a romance novel except a tiny part that made my stomach turn and my heart break a little.Its not an uncommon thing to see in similar situations and the hero needs it but that doesn't mean I liked it. 
 Anyway I loved the book (and I think you will too) ,the characters and the story which might be already told but still unique in its own way."

4,"It's hard to say what's so special about this novel. The characters and the plot are nothing new to young adult fiction. While Lara Jean's ethnicity adds some freshness to the young adult genre (she's of mixed race) she still somehow stumbles back into the insecure yet strikingly beautiful female protagonist trope. There's yet again (view spoiler)[another needless love triangle. (hide spoiler)] Yet, somehow the world Jenny Han manages to build seems quite elevated among the mediocrities of the plot. The difference is that Han makes her characters responsible for every action in the book. The relationships between all of the characters are more complex because all characters are allowed to have and explore their emotions. Peter is allowed to be vulnerable and excited about being in love without the writer trying to overcompensate by adding aggressive characteristics to counterbalance (think Edward's ""love = possession"" over Bella). Lara Jean's naivety propels her into some conflicting decisions but she never acts until she's considered and accepted it's what she really wants. These are actually the actions of young adults and it's refreshing to see their maturity getting the recognition they deserve."
1,"This book disappointed me - the concept sounded fantastic from the blurb, and I was looking forward to reading this when I began. However, as many other readers have found, the storyline seems slow-moving and it is hard to stay engaged. The concept of a moralistic tale which teaches readers not to go through life so quickly that one misses the living of it is worthwhile. But when I read this book, I found myself 150 pages in and feeling as though the true story had yet to begin. This, in a book of only 300-odd pages, was not a good sign. Although the ending was somewhat redeeming conceptually, I found the writing style still bored me and lacked engagement. I would not re-read this book, and had to really push myself to even finish it once."

4,"Another book I somehow missed reading during my adolescence. I think if I had read this when I was 15 it would be a five star favorite. It's completely charming- nostalgic, witty, and timeless. It's got a wonderful cast of eccentric characters in the most beautiful setting. The story is told over the course of several months as the lives of the Mortmain's are changed forever. It's a romantic story and a coming of age story and by the end you have a long-lasting impression of the castle and it's inhabitants. I appreciated that the ending wasn't tidy and all wrapped up. A lovely book to get lost in."
2,"I don't even know where to start. This book does make you feel many emotions. Those emotions being calmness, disgust, anxiety, anger, annoyance. You get my drift. I've never actually wanted to do bodily harm to a character but enter Keira. Really, she's a sweet girl but argh! I was never once happy with her even in the end I was not happy. It was a good book in that it made me feel such strong emotions but the length of the book and how it was drawn out with all her indecisiveness and selfishness did not make me a fan. I couldn't not stop reading though because I had to find out what actually would happen(I was right too) but anyway read it or don't."

4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 First buddy read with my friend Birgit :D 
 4/4.5 stars 
 ""Many things led to this day, for all of us. 
 A forgotten son, a vangeful mother, a brother with a long shadow, a strange mutation. 
 Together, they've written a tragedy."" 
 I can't believe that the first time I DNF this book. Was I sick or what?! It's just AMAZING! The first book in 2017 that I really, really enjoyed aside from a little detail: some scenes are just too similar to the HG. 
 I'm referring to the trip to the capital and Mare's forced speech, that reminded me immediately of Catching fire. Oh yes, and the Queenstrial was awfully similar to ""The Selection"". But since the resting parts were so good and the princesses were a bunch of badass hysterical fighters I can ""forget"" this flaw. 
 Now just give me some time to collect my thoughts in order to give you the motivations for my rating. 
 1) The narration 
 The narrator is a third person one, focused on Mare. Thanks to this, her thoughts are always present and make the story more involving, but at the same time the other characters are not left aside, but they're well analyzed. The style is neat and fluent, a mix of feelings and actions that make reading easy and captivating. 
 Moreover, the action scenes were really strong, intense and realistic that I was super excited everytime there was one beginning. The final scene in the arena? BRILLIANT. 
 2) The characters 
 ""He's strong, he's talented, he's powerful - and I'm his shadow. The shadow of the flame."" 
 After this cursed book I swear I'll never fall in love with any character, never again! I spent like two thirds of the novel drooling over the sweet, cute, shy and caring Maven, to later discover that he's just a cold, bloody, profiteering bastard! I remained literally traumathized, and I still am. And so here ""dies"" one of my two favourite characters of the book. 
 Fortunately the other one is still alive AND mentally healthy. I'm talking about Shade! 
 Unluckily I'm not really enthusiastic about Mare nor Cal. I hated the latter since the beginning and I suppose I will hate him still for a long time, while the former... well, more than a heroine is just a piece of the game moved by the players. She's really powerful and I'm fascinated by that, but she still lacks something, she's still not intuitive enough, perceptive enough to know truth and lie. 
 Kilorn is really cute and all but, poor boy, he's not that intelligent, plus he's this tendence to recklesness and suicide that I don't appreciate so much. But still he obviously cares for Mare more than for a simple friend, so I can partially understand his actions. 
 3) The catches 
 ""Maven, help me up"" 
 He rolls his shoulders, cracking the bones to chase away an ache. ""No, I don't think so."" 
 Sure Stefania, you hope that your sweet prince will remain so throughout all the story? It would be a shame if he revealed to be an amazing jerk. And this caused my first heart attack. 
 Oh well, I forgot the real first one. Do you like Shade? It would be such a shame if he died with you even not knowing his physical aspect! And right at the end... here he is, safe and sound! 
 Really, the second part of the book was too, too full of surprises! And most of them were bad news. Geez, I became ten years older... 
 I wasn't sure of what I should expect from this book since the ratings go from a usless one to at least four or five stars, but at the end I felt really satisfied. I was captured in the story, longing for knowing more and more about the dangerous threads that were tangling together, looking for answers. So far I found just one of them, but it's sure 100% that I'll read also the sequel to find out more!"
4,What an extraordinary accomplishment.
4,"Currently Re-Reading - Just that good. 
 Broken Dove is a great KA book (slightly unedited book with few long sections but exceptional story and characters that transport you to them instead of just reading about them.)"
3,"I expected more of the story. I thought it would go a little differently. I was excited to read an adult novel by Rowling and this book took me a year to finish because I took a long break in the middle. I didn't care about the characters. I couldn't figure out where the book was going, I just had a hard time connecting with it. There were some characters I liked, Gaia for one, Sukvinder (sp) for another. I felt bad for the Weedons, and I didn't really like Pagford as a whole. The problem was the plot never really went anywhere. The main story was trying to figure out if Bellchaple a methodone clinic should remain open or close its door forever. I found myself asking, ""Why do I care?"" By the time I closed in on the ending I knew someone was going to die. I was hoping that a nuke was going to be dropped on Pagford so I didn't have to read anymore. It would be a justified ending to the book. Instead a three year old and a fifteen year old die. The ending? Under my umbrella ella ella eh eh eh really it's just the beginning lyrics to the song, that it. When it was over I had this sense of, ""This is not what I was expecting at all."" I wanted to like the story. I wanted to feel involved with the story, but there just really wasn't one for me. The writing was good, as only J.K. Rowling does and if I was judging quality of writing this book would get five stars. But story wise? I can only give it three. 
 I would recommend this book to people who like knowing town gossip and are involved in local politics because that's the whole bases of this book. Gossip and small town politics."
5,"I call it science fiction though the jumping is probably fantasy, but the book is treated like SF. The original book, not the novelisation for the movie, was heart-wrenching, funny, fast-paced, poignant, and so very real in all the good ways, as the teen protagonist discovers he can teleport from place to place, at first to escape his abusive dad. Then he wants to do good . . . and discovers that there are consequences--from both sides. 
 I'm sorry that the movie appears to have removed all the heart from it, leaving just the violence, without much motivation, judging from the novelization that appeared afterward. No doubt many readers liked it, but that was not my cuppa."
4,"I picked up this book because it is the story of 3 adult sisters (I come from a family of 3 girls) who have all returned home when their mother is diagnosed with breast cancer. Their father is a professor at a liberal arts college whose passion is Shakespeare and rather than giving advice or an opinion, often throws out quotes from one of the plays. All 3 girls have their issues and coming home to help Mom often takes a back seat to resolving the crises in their lives. 
 I thought it would be fun to read a book about a family with 3 girls. Of course this family wouldn't have the same dynamic or problems as my family, but it would be an entertaining ride. Oddly, there were some amazing similarities. No, none of us are nymphomaniac thieves or came home pregnant without knowing who the father was (at least not me!). But the sentiment of loving each other and still feeling that sibling rivalry based on birth order must be universal because it completely resonated with me."

3,"2.5 stars, but since it's Rubio, I'll round it up to 3. 
 As expected, book 2 is not as great as book 1. The story is flat here, no pulse, though Rubio's sour attitude and his broken English help a lot. 
 The other good news is that Liam shows up quite consistently throughout this book. This helps since the banters between him and Rubio are drop dead hillarious."

 Review to come..."
5,"A delightful and memorable adventure, and my favourite Roald Dahl story, hands down. It was an extremely entertaining, poignant little tale that would touch anyone who is still a child at heart. What's not to love about a spunky little girl who has an exciting adventure with a big, friendly giant?"
3,"The S-Word by Chelsea Pitcher is not the best or worst book of all time. It had a great premise and potential; however, the execution was not amazing. First, I would like to take a second to thank the author for putting herself out there and also trying to accomplish a good book. This book is not going to go into the cannon of literature, but it still is a good book. Angie our protagonist is out to figure out who to blame for her best friend's suicide; the problem is that Angie is one of the many students who gave a hand (even if it was through inaction) in the bullying of Lizzie Hart. Lizzie was caught in a compromising situation with Angie's boyfriend on prom night, after that the word ""Slut"" is scribbled on her locker and soon the snow ball effect is initiated until Lizzie takes her own life. 
 So you figure, this is a regular old book about suicide and the effects of bullying, right? NO! This is not true, at least not completely. What Pitcher tried and was pretty successful for the most part was to create a detective story out of this. We follow Angie as she is questioning the cheer captain, the thespians, the weird creepy neighbor boy and finally Drake (the cheating ex). All this time there are pieces of Lizzie's diary being shoved into lockers with specific dates for specific people. There is this picture of what occurred between prom and Lizzie's suicide in the readers mind and every now and then, BAM! something happens to change that picture just a little bit. These changes are so subtle that it's almost unnoticeable; however, the picture at the beginning of the novel is completely different than that at the end. 
 What I liked: Lizzie is never present, present. Whenever Lizzie interacts with characters in the story it is through memories; however, she was a full blown active character. Nothing was meant to be supernatural in this story but the diary entries, the reactions of students and also Angie's behavior make Lizzie an almost tangible presence that can sometimes be stifling for the characters. That part of the book was cool; kudos Pitcher for creating a creepy ""Rebecca"" persona but with a heart (everyone who doesn't know what I am referring to please look up Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier). 
 What needs more work: the writing was not amazing; however, with above mentioned techniques this writer has the potential to eventually write great books. It takes practice people, and I find that if I can read what you wrote and understand the message(s), motifs, themes, language, and everything else that comes with literature then you are close to getting better. Sometimes I wish that some negative reviewers would try and sit in front of a computer and be creative. I don't mean talk about your opinion, I mean disguise your opinion so much that it is completely embedded in a story to the point of being hidden. It is not easy and I will not pretend it is. Again, I stress. For her debut novel I think she did great and if I were 10 years younger I probably wouldn't have cared if her writing was terrible as long as the story wasn't. 
 Thanks NetGalley!"
4,"""Sometimes the greatest memories are made in the most unlikely of places, further proof that spontaneity is more rewarding than a meticulously planned life. A meticulously planned anything."" 
 Andrew and Camryn's journey on the first book really gives me a great kick. Even though I thought that a follow-up story is unnecessary because the first book ended good for me, who am I to reject a follow-up story? 
 I'm one of those eager ones to get my hands on a copy of this book. The Edge of Never is one of the best books I've read for the year 2012 and I couldn't honestly wait to see more and what the future holds for Camryn and Andrew. But, before I star reading this, I have this little wish in me that whatever happened here, I hope that Andrew and Camryn would not stop their adventures together and my wish did come true!! 
 And the journey of Camryn Bennett and Andrew Parrish continues... 
 Where do I even start? Just like on the first book. I'm lost for words on how to describe the story of Camryn and Andrew - their adventures, misgivings, loss and happiness. I do love the sequel but at the very same time, it didn't quite reach my level of satisfaction as to the first book. 
 I have read one review about this book saying that she feels like The Edge of Always feels like a long epilogue to the first book and I could quite agree more. Yes, a lot happened here but not as remarkable as the first one. It feels like each chapter is jumping from one life event to another plus the true issue was resolved along the first 40% of my reading and the rest was just an ending or a better fitting term is an epilogue. 
 I like to see this book in two parts. The first parts are honestly slow. It's dragging and I'm waiting for something that will pumped my adrenaline to happen but sadly its just oh so so slow.It was also filled with sad events - the losses, withdrawals and that little list of promises that Andrew and Camryn made for each other. They are also back on the road but it feels like I'm really not into it anymore - the road trips and the sight seeing and using it as a blockage for what is really happening didn't quite appeal to me but at the same time I'm excited on what would happen next. 
 Fortunately, the second half make it for more. I'm so happy with it!! The last 5 to 6 chapters or so was fortunately good! Though there is not much adventure present as to what the first book has, the life lessons, discoveries and how the life of Andrew Parrish and Camryn Bennett plays out is all so worth it. As a romantic-at-heart I love how the second half was executed. It was full of love and happiness. It's like a fairy tale! 
 Andrew shows here how amazingly strong he is. Not physically, but in other aspects especially in supporting Camryn and his family. Despite the trials that he's been on the first book with his sickness, he comes out stronger and more determined. I admire his dedication to Camryn and how he's always there for her and doing anything to ensure her happiness. Camryn is through a ringer in here. She goes through a lot on this book and she deals with it by withdrawing herself even to Andrew. 
 Honestly, I was afraid that their relationship will be somehow tainted or get complicated but fortunately it was resolved easily. The changes they've been through brought so much growth for both of our characters not only as a couple but also individually. The transition with them from being two carefree people who just wanted to live one moment at a time, getting into different road adventures to a more matured couple who plans for their future was good to see. They we're still quite carefree on the first half of the book but they both grew. 
 Overall, it was a well travelled journey for the one of my favorite couples. If you enjoyed reading The Edge of Never, you would also enjoy this one. It has a different edge than the first book but still good nonetheless."
0,"I'm torn about this one because it has really good reviews, but I got to the bag of dead puppies and decided it wasn't for me. Maybe I'll try again if someone I trust reads it and tells me to get past that part, but for now I just couldn't!! Not going to rate it since I didn't get far enough to decide if it's actually good."
4,"This book wasn't at all what I expected, which I liked. The whole ""sisterhood of assassins"" thing could go so very flat and dystopian, but the strong flavor of the middle ages peps it up, and there's a 'strong girls saving ourselves' theme that isn't too heavy handed. I liked the sisters; I liked the main character; I liked the complexity of the plot. Ok, clearly the theme of sworn assassins is the next hot thing for YA novels discarding traditional or neo-traditional roles, but that's ok. Yes, there are echoes of Graceling and of Jacqueline Carey Kushiel novels (kinda creepy); on the other hand, there's a heavy dose of political naivete in the heroine, and the ending is... well, a reversal of what you might expect."
4,"I really enjoyed this book. It's different from what I normally read - it's not a romance. And while it's probably labeled YA, it's quite violent, dark and just a really good fantasy world. (although it's not heavy fantasy at all). 
 I loved the heroine and her journey in this book. So many unexpected things happen. A really great story - can't wait to see where we go with book two."
4,"You know what? I loved this comic! The story follows a hybrid deer/boy, Gus, who has antlers on his head as he navigates his small world with his god fearing father. Gus has never left his forest, and is told by his father that the world will burn if he does. But one day, his father gets sick and eventually succumbs to the disease that doesn't seem to affect hybrids. 
 When trying to figure out just why I loved it so much, I realized that this is one of the first comics I have read where the story is told by a vulnerable character. Gus is a sheltered boy who is actively hunted by people who want to turn hybrids in. He is a very likeable character - kind, sensitive, and sweet. 
 The gruesome world he lives in is somewhat more bearable since it is seen through his innocent eyes, and I felt a lot better after reading this story than The Walking Dead."

 At first, I didn't think I would like this book as much as the Pride series. But I think I do. In fact, I'm sure I do. I've read the first book in each series and the dragons are winning. So yeah, I do. 
 Shelly Laurenston has a totally different writing style than her alter ego G.A. Aiken. Both are good, both are hot. The main difference is Dragon Kin has a plot. Pride doesn't. At least, not yet. As with The Mane Event, this was a two-for-one deal. The first story was about Annwyl and Fearghus, and though hilariously hot, it was missing something. Whatever it was, I didn't realize it was missing until I read the second story about Fearghus's parents, Rhiannon and Bercelak. I loved their story. It was pure entertainment from beginning to end, and Rhiannon didn't get on my nerves like Annwyl did at times. Maybe that's it. Maybe I just didn't like Annwyl as much as Rhiannon, and that's what kept me from liking the first story as much. I also adored Bercelak more than I did Fearghus. So there you have it. 
 Again with the insta-love. Not my cup of tea but at least I felt the love was earned and not just given in this book. Love scenes were blazing as usual, and the crazy, lovesick banter kept my eyes glued to the pages. As much as I wanted to stop reading, I couldn't. I was just too entertained. 
 So for fans of Shelly Laurenston who haven't tried this series, please do. You'll love it. Definitely excited to read the next in the series, About a Dragon.

4,"Such a great ending to an addicting series. Omens was the first book by Kelley Armstrong that I've ever read and in the 8 short months since I picked that one up, I've read 8 other books by her! I definitely am a fan. 
 I'll agree with some of the other reviewers, there were some issues with the book. This book kind of left out the murder mystery elements in 3 of the other books (the parts that I loved!) and instead focused on wrapping everything up and resolving issues that I didn't even realize were there. She brought back elements from the first 4 books that I never would have realized had lasting impact on the overall story! It was a great way to make this truly this series ""whole"" if that makes any sense. And I loved how she treated the love triangle. While I love the fantasy of a love triangle (come on! 2 attractive guys each loving you for you??? what is more appealing!), I also loved how Kelley Armstrong treated this love triangle. She gave each Ricky and Gabriel an interesting story line and interesting personalities. They had their own things going on. Their lives didn't revolve around Olivia, which I really loved. 
 While I like the way that the author resolved the overarching problem (choosing between the fae), I agree with some of the other reviewers that she didn't reeeeaaaaalllllyyyyyy do what she said she was going to do. But I think it was a great finale! Now I need to pick up my next KA series."
5,"Ace is beginning his senior year at a new school. He thinks his misery is penance for his screwing with his best friend and boinking the coach's daughter. Why? He wants to change. So begins Downed. This is Ace's redemption. He was the ""evil character"" in the last book but everyone deserves a chance for redemption. 
 Bryant has many regrets. She feels like she failed her sister. Why couldn't she recognize her sister's pain? So, she started ""projects."" She turns jerks into human beings. Bryant has had success stories but Ace is a game changer. Bryant uses her projects to hide her pain. Bryant tried too hard to be everything to everyone. She wanted to be a good sorority sister, a good daughter, a good assistant to her father (Ace's new coach) and a good student. Why? She couldn't save her sister.... 
 The story was full of fun times, drama and super sexy hookups! Need More Ace? Read My Full Review!

4,"Dream Thieves was a good continuation from The Raven Boys; and it wasn't any better or worse. 
 I did like that we got to learn a lot more about Ronan in this book because I find him to be the most interesting character. 
 There were some things in this book that I felt needed a little more, or maybe better, explanation but it didn't really ruin the pacing of the book. 
 Yet again, as with The Raven Boys, we have been left on a cliff hangar/ revelation. I'm very tempted just to go right ahead and read Blue Lily, Lily Boy. Like now. Like right now. 
 A good series, I hope it continues to be as good or maybe (fingers crossed) get even better."
4,"Paige is one of the best party planners around and has done many weddings in her line of work. But as much as she loves seeing everything she's planned come together and watch the happy brides walk down the aisle, she has no desire to do that herself. In her mind marriage is nothing more than a business transaction, and no one can dissuade her of that thinking. 
 Enter Richard ""Dirty Dick"" Dawson, her one time best friend and now hated frenemy. He's the man Paige can't seem to shake no matter how hard she tries and the one person that can drive her crazy. A stupid mistake now has them forced together when all Paige wants to do is forget he ever existed. At least, that's the lie she tells herself. 
 Paige and Dick are a couple that will frustrate you in the sweetest way. They constantly fight and bicker but all of their arguments can't hide the bubbling sexual tension that's boiling right under the surface. The two had a pretty long history that you learn most of early on and it makes their story all the more intriguing. What you don't learn until the end just made the ending so much better when you get their whole backstory. 
 Brooke Blaine perfectly entwined this story full of sexy moments, frustrating sexual tension, and a rom-com so sweet and funny you'll be unable to stop grinning from start to finish. I honestly don't know any other way to describe this book but to say that it was the quintessential romantic comedy. It had the adorable characters you can't help but fall for and the quirky moments that have you laughing along with them. 
 I am obsessed with this series and group of friends so I can't wait for more from them. Quinn is definitely a captivating character and has me dying for her story so I can finally learn all of her secrets, so I hope we won't have too much longer to wait! 
 ARC kindly provided in exchange for an honest review."
2,DNF because i felt it was more of a tween novel and things were a bit slow but the whole concept of certain people having superpowers was interesting so i plan to finish it sometime soon.

4,"I really enjoyed this. It was pure royalty fluff and I loved every second of it. This follows a young Queen Victoria from her first few days as Queen to her engagement to Prince Albert. I personally would have liked it if Goodwin went a little more in depth with Victoria and Ablert's relationship. Goodwin just skimmed past it and then ended the book quite abruptly. 
 I still enjoyed this though. I would recommend this book to people who like historical royalty books. I love, love, love those types of books. This was addicting and fun and dramatic. I totally recommend Goodwin's book."
4,"**4 Stars** 
 I really enjoyed the book when I first started reading it. In fact, I couldn't put it down. However, once Essie was kidnapped my enjoyment started to wane. I did not agree with her reactions. Essie seemed too attached to Dane, even though she was still angry, but it was the attachment that came out of no where. There was nothing really leading up to that, and during the build-up to the kidnapping everything made it seem like she would just be in a blind fury, unable to control the rage. 
 Essie is not your normal ""Snow White"" princess. She does live with seven.... well... drones (ones she made herself); but rather than the delicate little princess, Essie enjoys cage fights and stitching together computer and mechanical components. Living on the frozen mining planet Thanda, Essie thought she had escaped her past until Dane appears and kidnaps her in an attempt to ransom her for Exile prisoners. 
 I did like Dane's character. His development was much smoother than Essie's. You do not fully understand Essie's aversion to people touching her until about three-quarters of the way through the book. And even then, it is hinted at but not fully realized until the very end. It turns out she wasn't just running away from being murdered by her step-mother, Olivia. She was running from her father as well. 
 Overall, I think it was a clever adaptation of Snow White, and fairly well written. There were just a few character development flaws and a few situations that did not quite work for the story. 
 Recommended, especially for fans of classic retellings."
5,"An unforgetting read :) 
 It's kind of impossible to explain the sensations you experience while reading this novel, because it's that kind of story that feels so wrong, and yet you can't stop reading it, be obsessed about it, love it, hate it, hunt every word with frenzy so you can find out what happens next.. 
 I had one of the most complicated relations with Frederick.. a hate-love-hate kind of situation. I know, you will say ""What can one possibly like at this character?"". He is a psiho, a crazy man, weard and broken. But I felt sorry for him sometimes, thought his lonelyness made it this person.. I believed he needed so desperate to be loved, admired, and that he will change at some point, make the right choices, repair all the damage he had done unwillingly.. But I was wrong, because he didn't learn nothing, and in the end, he was the same bastard. 
 I loved Miranda so much, her power, her struggle, her personality. I admire her, she is an impressive character, a strong and yet sensitive woman, an atist.. She lost her freedom but not her judgement. Being captivated didn't changed her that much.. 
 It was perfect that the book had two POVs.. That the first half is narrated by the collector, and the other by Miranda.. This novel wasn't as I expected, I am a romantic and I wanted a love story, but that would have been, besides of wrong, predictable. And John Fowles doesn't write nothing predictable, so I find it perfect the way it is, even with the unexpected, heartbreaking end. 
 This book is a hunting psihological thriller, that had an impact on me.."
2,"Beautiful prose, full of positive messages, and a story about finding yourself and your voice. All in all, a lovely story, but just didn't work for me. 
 - The characters are the shining stars of this story. Developed, fleshed out - flaws and all - and constantly challenged stereotypes, all characters felt wonderfully human. 
 - A slowburn romance that begins as a friendship and slowly builds to a meaningful relationship built on trust, mutual support, and respect. 
 - Explores Elyse's new disability and the struggles of losing her voice and also to eventually find it. 
 - Gorgeous writing that is all at once poetic, emotional, and vivid. 
 - Celebrates a variety of positive messages about sexuality, recovery, empowerment, respect, love, and expression of identity. 
 - Unfortunately, the story is really, really slow which hindered my enjoyment of the book."
2,"I have a feeling that I've read books by this writer before. However, I can't recall which or when, that's how unmemorable it must have been. I've started to write reviews mainly because it clears my head, but also because it helps me keep track. So what did I think of this book? To me it felt as if the writer got bored with the whole thing right from the middle of the story, when they get together onwards. I actually found that part sweet. It wasn't entirely believable for a guy like Shane to have that kind of insight and understanding about the psyche of a woman he'd only known for a short while, but it was real. Their interactions felt real and poignant. That's why I gave the book an additional star to tell the truth. The plot, the second half of the book and the ""threat"" were written as if she just wanted to get the who,e thing over with! So this was my review of the quality of the book. And again I reitierate, despite my personal preferences that I'll be listing shortly, the first half was engaging enough to get me invested in the whole thing. 
 So my review as regards my tastes in the matter: the premise of the story. I think the world they live in is to gritty, the work she engages in is too depressing, everything, every scene and even people seem worn, dilapidated, grimy and ugly sad, as in the kind of ugly that makes you sad. So there you go! I hope my review will be helpful for at least one other person. Cheers!"
3,"This was an enjoyable read. Book six in the series so not a good jumping on point. I will be reading the next one, which hopefully comes out soon."
3,"I'm wavering between 3 and 4 stars on this one. 
 It's smart and well-crafted. There are lots of mysteries and intricacies that make you sit down and try to unravel the truth. 
 I actually started to enjoy the book more as I finished it. I was put off by the awful, selfish characters in the first two sections, especially the immaturity of all of the characters in the 1999 section."
3,"** spoiler alert ** 
 Anything JR Ward writes, I will read because she is one of my favorite authors. I was honestly waiting for one of the characters to bump to some Luda or Lil Wayne and hear Butch's Boston accent, but I was eager to start this book because I wanted to see how she writes outside of paranormal and I was both pleased and surprised. Her wiring is always impeccable, great language, building characters, and keeping readers guessing are her forte. I have noticed people mentioning her redundant reference to Lizzie's ""natural beauty"", and I must confess it annoyed me as well. Maybe it is because I am a female but I found it sort of... insincere that was one of the key factors that he is attracted to her. Don't get me wrong, Lizzie seems like a lovely and kind girl but why does her not wearing makeup (even though I doubt her lips are naturally rosy red) and her calloused hands have to be a major factor? It ruined the credibility for me. Also, her and Lane's relationship does not make sense to me. Like okay, I get it he is Channing Tatum's rich Kentucky-bred twin but other than that, what made their love so AMAZING after a three month duration? Or maybe I am being too picky but I found that odd. 
 I loved Gin's character like people love stopping on the highway to check out a car crash. So flawed! I am still reading the book and I hope it progresses well!"
4,"See more book reviews on my blog. 
 The first thing that stands out to me about this book is the scope of it. Red Rising was brutal and heartbreaking, and a lot of that is due to the fact that we were stuck in a confined space with a cast we got to know, and it made everything concentrated. Golden Son opens up the whole solar system, and I haven't quite decided if I like that or not. Yes, we got to have political machinations that span planets and grand, sweeping movements, but we also lost the focus that made the first book so intense. I feel like a lot of the personality and heart that I was expecting got lost in the void of space. 
 Which is not to say that this book isn't drenched in violence and blood, it is, but ""thousands of people die in an instant when the ship explodes"" does not have the same emotional impact as ""this one person that you really, really like got stabbed in the face."" Of course, we have some of those moments, too, but because things aren't as character-focused as the last book, they felt a little muted to me. 
 On the up side, in terms of plot, this book delivers. One of my favorite things in fiction are stories about rebellions and the pure logistical machinations of how to fuck over a ruling party, where to strike, how to undermine them, stuff like that. Not the force, but the figuring out of how to apply that force. This book is all about that, as the focus is Darrow trying to use what influence he has to bring down a great lumbering beast of a system. Some stuff he tries fails, some stuff causes fireworks, and almost nothing goes like it's supposed to. (Unexpected consequences have to be one of my favorite things about this novel.) There's a lot of moving parts in this novel, and I loved all of them. Especially since, for such a busy book, it was surprisingly easy to follow and all of the twists and turns felt very natural and not like they were just in there for shock value. 
 The book tackles a lot of heavy moral issues, as well, and mostly I appreciated that. It brought up some interesting conversations, and while the dialogue was a bit stilted and cheesy, I still liked that these conversations were happening. But I could have done with a bit less. There were points where it felt too forced, like the topic came up just because someone wanted to write about it. I also got confused every time Darrow started talking about what to do after the Society falls, because it sounds like he wants to return to...well, present day. But if this is all set in the future and what we've got now led to the Society being set up...then doesn't that imply that what we've got now doesn't work? Why go back to it? I have this problem in a lot of future dystopians where the backstory doesn't involve some sort of forceful takeover, but it was actually a talking point in this book so it bothered me more than usual. 
 Final note: the last book was pretty bad with the misogyny. And this book...well, isn't much better. We do have more female characters and a greater variety of them and they are all awesome, but there's only parity in the tertiary characters, not the secondary characters. And the constant harping on Darrow's dead wife gets worse - she's pretty much the Women in Refrigerators distilled down to its purest, most concentrated form and then mentioned on ever other page. To make matters worse, there's another dead wife backstory that pops up, because apparently that's the only reason this book can think of for prompting a character into rebellion. (No rape plot, though, always a bonus. I didn't mind it in the last book because it was saying things I agreed with, and now that it's not being used for making a point it's faded out of the plot, except for when the ""literally made for sex"" prostitutes show up and talk about it.)"
4,"This was a fun and entertaining second chance-ish romance. The Mistake is book 2 in the interconnected stand alone Off-Campus series. Book 1 introduced us to our hero, John Logan, and several other characters who appear again in The Mistake, but it's not necessary to read The Deal first - though I HIGHLY recommend it because it's so good! 
 Logan and Grace were sugary sweet! Sometimes it got pretty cheesy, but I'm a sucker for that so I didn't mind! Both were likeable characters and I loved how much they both grew, matured, and really came into their own throughout the story. Yes, they make some mistakes along the way, but their insecurities and fears are relatable and understandable. I loved seeing this side to Logan after meeting him in The Deal and I found his grand gestures and loyalty (for better or for worse) endearing. The banter between Grace and Logan was hilarious and witty and had me laughing out loud throughout the book. It definitely had me rooting for them to get their happily ever after. 
 Although I enjoyed The Deal more, I still felt Logan and Grace's story was wonderfully entertaining. I think I just was a little put off with how their initial interactions began/went. I really questioned Grace's judgement when Logan showed up unexpectedly at her door and honestly, he just came across as plain sleezy. I'm glad that as the story progressed they both proved me wrong. In the end, I fell in love with them just as much as Hannah and Garrett, and the epilogue left me with a HUGE smile on my face. I'm loving this series so far and I'm excited to read Dean's story next!"
5,This book was amazing.
4,"Oh man, this book. I read it in one night, stayed up late to finish it. I really, really enjoyed it and a tear (or 5) slipped down my face as I finished it. I had kind of normal expectations going in and I was surprised at how into it I got, it was so different from anything I'd ever read before, and it was paced so well. Loved all the characters, you'd hate someone and then love them a second later - I think Jay is a great writer to make you feel that. If you like beauty and the beast, YA and fantasy, I think you will like this book. Don't read it if you don't like all of those things. Is it great literature? No but I really enjoyed it, not quite 5 stars but pretty darn close."
5,"I liked this way more than I thought I would. 
 The writing was just.... PERFECT"
4,"**3/25 EDIT: Bumping this up .5 a star after re-reading. It was one of those ""better the second time around"" stories :)** 
 'We're going to be working together, so non-client dinners would be unprofessional.' I brought my mouth closer to hers and our breaths mingled as I said quietly, 'Let's be unprofessional together, Annie.' 
 Last month I mentioned how Collaborative Fiction is one of the trends for 2015 and The Hooker and The Hermit was one example of just one of the ones coming out that I was excited for. I think that is a common reaction when you add one LH Cosway with one Penny Reid. I am a huge fan of both authors and was eagerly anticipating what they could come created together. I have to say that I wasn't disappointed. The Hooker and The Hermit was funny, sexy, and really romantic. 
 'I don't want you, Ronan,' I whispered harshly, 'Not enough to change who I am.' 
 I really don't think you can ever go wrong with a dirty-talking bad boy of rugby with the looks of Collin Farrell and the Irish charm to boot. And with a name like Ronan, you can best expect your panties to be in peril at several points throughout the story. Ronan was a little cocky, very charming, and irresistible to someone like Annie, who lives her life behind a computer screen. Annie is a social disaster. Truly the self-proclaimed hermit, most of Annie's social interaction are the ones found online. Especially considering she is secretly behind one of the biggest celebrity blogs out there. As you can expect, Annie's plans of solitude and seclusion are blown to hell when she and Ronan find themselves in each others' lives. 
 'This is happening. You and I are happening, and this is real.' 
 The moments between Annie and Ronan are full of sexual tension that both Cosway and Reid are pros at writing. But the strength of The Hooker and The Hermit really lies in Annie and her whole story arc. She is such a recluse but you see her battling past her comfort zone and her vulnerability is endearing. I loved her backstory and the reasonings behind why she chooses to live her life the way she does. Overall, I really enjoyed this original story from two of my favorite authors. It wasn't my favorite from either but I would gladly read anything thew two pen together in the future, if it was an option! 
 4.5 stars!"
5,"GUYS. THIS BOOK. *swoons* Is it just me, or do the books get way more angsty and hot with each book? (Yes, the cover is especially swoon-worthy.) Beau and Zane are really just something else. I loved Fast Connection, but this book might top that as my favorite? I love the enemies-to-lovers trope, and this just checks all the boxes. We met Beau and Zane in Hard Wired. Beau Starr - the popular, all-American YouTuber spouting inspiration on his channel to his followers. TrashyZane - a messy YouTuber who shares videos from his daily life and, well, tends to overshare everything. Beau and Zane are polar opposites of each other, judging by their YouTube channels, but that's what makes this story so compelling to read. 
 Where in Hard Wired we had two precious cinnamon role love interests, here we have a push-and-pull relationship with some larger than life characters. Being a YouTuber is all about the persona the person puts on for the world to see, right? Well, Zane is exactly who he is in real life and on his channel, and he doesn't hide his day-to-day from his subscribers. Beau, on the other hand, has built himself into this perfect, unruffled version of himself to his subscribers. For the most part, it's worked out for Beau over the time he's had his channel and it's never been a problem for him to be ""on"" in front of the camera. When real life hits Beau, it's something he finds himself hiding away, using pre-recorded videos to upload to his channel until he can pull himself out of the funk he's gotten himself into. 
 We'd run into each other at various events over the years, but he always sort of looked through me. And was this what I'd resorted to? Subbing the crush I resented to millions of subscribers? So mature. Much adult. 
 Well, for those who have read Hard Wired, Mature Content starts a little bit before the confrontation at the end of HW. These books totally work as standalone novels, but the characters complement each other so well between the books, that I would highly recommend reading all the books in this series. We do get cameos of Jesse and Ian (no cameos from the beloved characters from the first two books though, because honestly, Beau and Zane just run in a different crowd than our Army and gamer guys). 
 Groaning, I slithered down to the edge of my bed and tried to grasp my phone with my toes. Not only did it fail, I kicked it halfway across the room. 
 ""Oh my fucking god,"" I wailed. ""Death to the foul bitch who is causing this tragedy."" 
 The books are told from both the character's perspectives, and I have to say, just by the second page, I was already in love with Zane. There's just something really lovable about him and the way he does whatever he feels like doing, or saying. Beau has a darker side to him, or well, a darker past that he wants to keep hidden from the world. He especially wants to keep his past hidden from his parents, and from the network trying to get him to sign a contract deal to appear on television. 
 Zane's answer was a toss of his hair, which lashed my ear. His hair smelled like grapefruit. I used to eat grapefruit for breakfast with a bit of sugar sprinkled on top, but now grapefruit were dead to me. I planned to spit on the next grapefruit I saw with vigor. 
 When Beau and Zane are around each other, sparks fly. They just have this ridiculous chemistry. And the way to push each other's buttons at first that leads them to having sex together for the first time? SO. HOT. Let's just say the book's title is aptly named. I loved reading Beau and Zane's story and how they slowly turn from arch-nemesis to...something more. 
 Maybe deep down I'd wanted this attention, but now that I had it, it was like nails on a chalkboard. Vanilla? It made me want to show him exactly how I fucked, and just how loudly I could get him to beg for it. Just how rough I could go, as he'd repeatedly referenced in his video. 
 Beau and Zane introduce us to a new cast of characters we've only met in passing in previous books, including Lyrix, Zane's ex-boyfriend who brings a lot of drama to his Twitch stream. I liked a new character, Lush. He's a YouTuber who spills details and investigations into other YouTubers' drama and personal lives. Most of the time, he's annoyingly in the way of Beau and Zane's business, but Lush seems interesting. Also fascinating is a new character named Warren, that has connections to Beau. Possible love interest in a future book? I think it could definitely be really something if he and Lyrix are in a book together. Anyways, there's just something about the Cyberlove series where all the secondary characters, as long as they have a name, are characters I want to see with their own stories in the future. 
 I really loved Mature Content. Beau and Zane are forces to be reckoned with, and Megan and Santino managed to create another story filled with exciting, fun characters. I can't wait to see what else they have in store!!!"
2,"This is definitely my least favorite of the series. Way too many viewpoints, way too convoluted storyline, and way unsatisfying in the romance department."
4,"I have been meaning to read this book for a couple years now, since I saw Sofia's review. It looked really interesting, but I kept putting it off. After finally reading this book, I am kicking myself for having not read it before. Because the author was at a book signing I went to recently... and I had a chance to meet him. But I didn't go because I am lame. 
 Although I really didn't have many expectations about this book. I was completely thrown off by everything that happened. I just expected something different. But I did really enjoy this book. 
 I found it frustrating how Rafe felt the need to completely hide a part of himself so as to fit more into society, and I think maybe this was because I know he was able to make his decisions from a place of privilege. that is not to say that I did not understand why he made his decisions, I just didn't agree with most of his choices. 
 It was really quite interesting to see this person go from a home and Friends where he is open with his sexuality to a whole other place where he feels the need to hide who he is away from people. That's pretty much the opposite of most LGBT stories I've read. 
 One thing that I was really quite fond of was the nerdy type of romance between two of the characters. Nerdy Romance is the best romance. 
 I really did enjoy this book and I recommend it as an alternative point of view from somebody society views as different wanting to try and fit in."
4,"I was anticipating this one, because I really wanted to see the story of these three sisters end on a high note after falling in love with the first book as hard as I did. There's something special about a contemporary romantic comedy that's written with heat, heart and wit. It's SO easy to fall into really obvious maneuvers with paper thin characters. It's easy to do what people who think the worst of romance expect. So to do this genre well necessitates really sharp writing. You have to deliver on the expected while keeping someone involved with not only the romance and the heat, but on the story of these two flawed, interesting, funny, believable characters. 
 So when I find a contemporary romance that can do that I remember why it is I started reading this genre. It was because of the stories by Susan Elizabeth Phillip, Jennifer Crusie, and Lisa Kleypas. Their characters stuck with me in the way that I think of Gabe whenever I see a Drive in, and of Jack when I was building my son's crib. These people became real to me, and it's why I read. 
 Shalvis touched that sort of storytelling in her first Lucky Harbor. In the second she lost me, unfortunately. Maybe I put my expectations into the stratosphere, but I just wanted more from Tara and Ford. I was hoping so much for Sawyer and Chloe. They kept me reading, but when it came to their story it took me a minute to pick it up, because I feared the expected. The easy outs and simplifications. 
 I have to admit starting out, I thought that's what I'd be getting. Chloe's inner monologue of ""he's so sexy but I hate him"" and his hating that he felt attracted to her felt...blah. I wasn't into it. I put it down for a minute, because I hated seeing that happen to Chloe and Sawyer. And then...then we got somewhere. Chloe was bold but vulnerable and it was her fighting it out with her own lungs and her ready to go battle over her friend's cystic fibrosis that had me rooting for her, and wanting so much for her. And then there was Sawyer trying to protect an entire town with just his two hands, and the way in which he fell in love with the both the aggressive side and vulnerable of Chloe. I liked the slow falling between these two. It was sexy, sweet and emotional. I felt for them both as people, which made the falling in love that much more."
4,"I haven't read many books base on Fae, and this was quite an interesting read for me. I think there were times I thought I should be offended (dialogs) but the plot kept me intrigued and in the end I really enjoyed reading this book. 
 There still many mysteries that needed to be answered, and I cannot wait to read book 2!"
4,"To many, I was myth incarnate, the embodiment of a most superb legend, a fairy tale. Some considered me a monster, a mutation. To my great misfortune, I was once mistaken for an angel. To my mother, I was everything. To my father, nothing at all. To my grandmother, I was a daily reminder of loves long lost. But I knew the truth--deep down, I always did. 
 I was just a girl. 
 With an opening like that, I just knew what I was going to read was going to be magnificent, and I was right. Although, I didn't realize just how magnificently sad Ava's life was going to become. 
 THE STRANGE AND BEAUTIFUL SORROWS OF AVA LAVENDER started off slow, for me. I had picked up this book because of the hype, but I just assumed that I would be reading the story of Ava Lavender, and only her. I didn't think that I would be seeing her family's past, the way I did, and how by knowing that past, I was able to understand Ava's life all the better. 
 Love makes us such fools. 
 Love, and the disasters that fall on all of us when we do love, played such a significant part to this story. From Maman (Ava's great grandmother) losing the love of her life and more, to Emilienne (Ava's grandmother) who also lost so much when it came to love, and Viviane (Ava's mother), who went through heartbreak and never really overcame it; I realized that when it came to love, Ava's story would probably have a similar fate. Love has not been kind to her family. 
 It did take a while to meet Ava, but when we did, she came into this world on her birthday, with a very unique attribute attached to her back - wings. She grew up in seclusion, kept in her home, because her mother feared that people wouldn't understand or would fear Ava and her wings. 
 And yet, Ava still made friends. She still found love, and she still discovered that the world does have some messed up people in it, and that when that darkness touches you, sometimes you cannot recover. 
 I pretty much loved most aspects of this book. Writing and story were great. The characters were really interesting to read about, and I could only feel sorry that these women had had such horrific luck when it came to love in their life. This ended up being such a darker tale than I had anticipated, but even so, I loved it to the very end. 
 The secondary characters in this story really made this for me. Mostly, I loved Gabe, the poor love struck fool (he fell hard and in forever love with Viviane) and Rowe, who loved Ava fully and without any reserve. If she didn't have her wings, I think she would have broken this weird ""curse"" on her family when it came to love. Rowe was a gentle soul, and so was Ava. Together, I think they would have been perfectly happy and content falling and staying in love. 
 I absolutely despised Jack Griffith and Nathaniel Sorrows, both of course for very different reasons. However, they were so completely necessary for this story, and so even with all the heartbreak they caused, without them, this story wouldn't have been as brilliant as I think it was. Although it would have been a much happier tale without these two bastards in it. 
 I definitely recommend reading THE STRANGE AND BEAUTIFUL SORROWS OF AVA LAVENDER if you haven't already. I felt like this book deserved the hype it's received."

 I finished this in one long, fascinated pull last night, and it kept weaving into my dreams. Just before I woke up, I was composing an elaborate review looking back at the history of the novel, specifically the narrative frame. Like, early 1700s, novels by Mary Davys and others make almost incoherent, certainly idtastic reading. Then came Pamela with its exchanges of letters and the novel really took off. 
 Tom Jones is a departure--the novel is narrated by the author, who prefaces each part with disquisitions on mid-1700s life and politics, most of them quite funny. Think blog posts. But most novels were epistolary until Jane Austen figured out that there could be a narrator, who may or may not be her. And then we had the omniscient narrator in various guises for another hundred years. 
 Here's the thing about this novel, which I kept sneaking back to when I should have been working: I think the author knows who the narrator is, and that's going to be important. 
 This style is not new: in the past couple of decades we've seen this twist on the old epistolary style, which presents a novel in a series of texts, tweets, diary entries, letters, memos, etc. But a lot of those I've read seem to be merely a device. In Neuvel's novel, we have an unnamed interviewer who furnishes exactly two personal details in the entire book, having numbered interviews in reports. And we don't see them consecutively, which seems to be a hint that these selections are deliberately chosen, with others left out. Who is that interviewer reporting to? And is it the same unknown who provided this selection from those reports? 
 Aside from that, this is a novel about a giant robot. I think it's more fun for potential readers to leave it there. As it happens I guessed the twists near the end, but as they were all twists I really hoped to see, I was even more delighted, and intensely intrigued to read more. Terrific characters and character development (difficult to pull off in interview form!) fast pace, and a wry tone make it a real pleasure to read."
5,"If someone is going to read this book out loud to you, that someone should be Gary Sinise."
3,"As a complete work, Haunted is even harder to follow then Palahniuk's other works -- and that says something. 
 The work is ambitious; it follows a large cast of characters, with none being more central than others, all with bizarre names like Comrade Snarky and Baroness Frostbite. The novel is written in the first-person present tense, from the point of view of the collective cast of characters. That alone took a good while to get used to. 
 Then there is the format of the book -- it is a story about a writer's retreat, interspersed with poems and stories by and about the various writers on the retreat. The 23 short stories are definitely the highlight of the book, while the overarching storyline is weaker and muddled. 
 As with Palahniuk's other works, this should feature a disclaimer that it is both extremely shocking and disgusting. It is not for the faint of heart."
5,"10% zombies, 90% survival story. I avoided this for a long time because I'm so burnt out on the zombie genre but this is a brilliant piece of storytelling. I read this in one sitting. Its a major page-turner and I can't get my hands on the rest of the series fast enough."

I also absolutely loved the whole fanfic side of the story! I'm a huge fanfic reader myself so Fangirl completely clicked with me! It was fantastic and the characters and the story itself were just amazing...such a wonderful story! I NEED to read Rainbow's other books now!!!! :D And Levi...Levi, Levi, Levi! Love him! :D 
 I just reread this one as an audiobook, too, and it was just as amazing! I loved Cath, her stories, her friends, her family, and just everything! :D This one is still a big favourite of mine! :D"
5,"""I have hated the words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right"" 
 This one took me forever to finish. But it was worth it- so worth it and I'll try to tell you why. 
 To be able to love this book, I think, you must love words. 
 I'm not saying if you didn't like this book then you don't love words- so don't get all huffy puffy- maybe you're in it more for the story or the characters or the feeling you get from reading or maybe I'm making no sense what..okay. 
 I loved the details and the way everything was described, I love how one of my longest breaks from this book was taken because I was mourning a character (death's telling this story so obviously there would be death- no spoiler there). I fell for the characters slowly and I love that. I love how achingly sad I felt throughout the last few chapters, I loved the foretelling and foreshadowing and how it all tied up towards the end. I love how this book is beautiful and compelling and haunting. 
 You will love this book if you love words."
4,"From the author of the 2012 best-seller, Me Before You, comes another quirky and pleasant read. British author Jojo Moyes pulls fans back in to her fabulous writing style with One Plus One, a story about a single mother slash housekeeper on the English seaside, and the relationship that progresses with one of her affluent, albeit eccentric, clienteles; oh and lest not forget to mention one big road-trip filled with plenty of mishaps of a dysfunctional family to the Math Olympiad along the way. 
 The novel's main character Jess Thomas works two jobs on top of attempting to care for two children--one of whom is not even her own blood. They barely scrape by even with all the efforts Jess makes. Tanzie, her daughter, is a math whiz, but if she only goes to the local comprehensive next year, she will be scarlet lettered a geek, just as her teen step-brother Nicky is. Nicky is the child of Jess's ex's first marital, but he remained with Jess when the bloke walked out. A thoughtful guy, he is bullied and beaten up all the time by other guys for being as sensitive as he is. 
 The novel's main plot begins with Tanzie being offered to compete at the Math Olympiads, which Jess comes to find out that her daughter could possibly win PS5000. I'd like to win that much cash! Unfortunately for the struggling family, the event is in Aberdeen, much too far from their small seaside home and they can't afford the fare to get there by proper transportation. This results in Jess doing the only thing she can think of, which is to pile all three members of their little dysfunctional family, plus their trusty old dog into the small rundown car left behind by Jess's ex. Such a beaten down vehicle could not make the long drive after all, much to the dismay of the family, but to their luck, one of Jess's clients happened to be driving by, in his own personal dilemma, and offers to drive the lot in his Porsche. 
 You can bet countless pit-stops, carsickness, a drooling canine, and the awkwardness of one's high-paying boss bearing witness to it all results in one chaotic adventure for the lot. 
 The overall plot of the story may cause some to cringe at the thought of it, after all, we all have been on one of those dreadfully long road-trips, packed into a small car with family who we all love but can only stand to be with for so long before going insane. However, Moyes has an incredible way of making the ride quite hilarious and she knows how to expertly take control of the situation to switch the mood to take on a more serious tone when needed. 
 Just like all of the best road trips, One Plus One is far more about the journey than the destination. You'll be rooting for this ragtag group until the very end! A must read for all.

 Brian is just the guy my mama would warn me about. He's the bad boy in town..has tattoos everywhere, talks dirty and disses out on almost everyone but he's gets totally mushy when it comes to Candace. Candace on the other hand who's been in love with Brian for years already, is like the princess in the hidden fortress. Ruled by her parents and practically her whole family. Their relationship is kinda ""against-all-odds"" so yes, it has drama all over it. I love their pairing although it's inevitable that they'd be confronted by people who thinks they're not good for each other especially Candy's family.. they got through all of it of course. I expected that this was going to have a happy ending like the first book, turns out.. it has a better ending and also a much better story. 
 This novel is just sizzling hot it makes me want to get a permanent tattoo. haha.. oh well.. i would someday.. all at the right time honey.. all at the right time. For now i'd have to settle for this henna tattoo i got on my shoulder..=)"
3,"Beautiful Disaster was kind of a guilty pleasure read for me. I enjoyed it quite a bit, but at the same time I recognized the problems in the relationships between the characters and why some of it was unhealthy. Yes, a lot of stuff Travis did annoyed me beyond belief and in real life I would never tolerate that kind of behavior. But this is fiction, and as long as you realize that, I think it's alright to suspend your belief in something if it's entertaining (because that's a big part of why I read, to be entertained). So I was definitely interested in picking up the rest of the books in the series - each of Travis's brothers probably has some kind of story to tell. I ended up enjoying Beautiful Oblivion, but overall it was kind of a mixed bag. 
 Good things: 
 - The pacing was quick and it took me next to no time to finish. It's also not very long. 
 - It has that addictive feeling to it that grabs you and doesn't want to let go. The drama is interesting, and trust me, there's plenty of it. 
 - Cami isn't a bad protagonist. Like the summary says, she's pretty independent and spirited. She was good about making decisions and standing up to Trenton when he did something she didn't like, even when it was a small thing (like when he called her boss and got her time off work). I liked her a lot more than Abby, who was indecisive to the point where I wanted to stab something. 
 - There's a good, strong female friendship in the book between Cami and Reagan, similar to the one between Abby and America. 
 - I actually liked Trenton a lot. He's possessive and controlling, it's true, but to a much lesser degree than Travis. He seemed much more level-headed and able to control himself when he got angry. Trenton's not perfect, and to be honest he's not the most memorable love interest ever, but he was sweet enough. 
 - I really enjoyed that twist at the end about Cami's boyfriend, T.J. I honestly did not expect it at all. 
 Bad Things: 
 - My main problem with this book is that I've read this story before - twice. I've read about this same fire in this same school. It's gotten very old. Because I'd read it in BD and Walking Disaster, I was already aware of how it ended, and for that reason there was absolutely no tension at all in the climax of the book. None. Zero. Zilch. 
 - I was kind of annoyed by how easy Cami's life was all the time. If she needed time off work, bam, it was done. If she needed to leave early or needed a ride or just anything at all, it was there. There were no issues at all, and it felt very unrealistic. 
 - I hated Cami's family. I don't know how the author intends for the reader to feel about them, but whenever Cami's brothers talked about how their family was falling apart, I was like, ""Good. Let it."" Her father is a complete monster and everyone seems to take his side constantly no matter how wrong he is. Her brothers are jerks for going along with it and her mother doesn't help the situation by just sitting idly by and doing nothing productive at any point in time. I just wanted Cami to drop them all until they made some big changes because, family or not, they were nothing but a giant negative impact on her life.

3,"I have continued to read the Sookie Stackhouse series because of my like for the main characters and the premise of the novels - but this was the first book in the series (since the 4th book) that I actually enjoyed reading. The last few books have seemed to be the same in plot, character development, etc. My interest has especially been captured with the novels continual development of Sookie's and Eric's relationship. I would like to see more of this! I honestly don't know how many more books should be in the series though, since as stated above, the plot line seems to fizzing out, and not as exciting as in the first four novels. I will continue to read the series though, since I have read all the others and to hopefully see a resolution to the story."
4,"It took me a little while to get into this book, and I still feel like there was a little bit *too* much love (outside of the love triangle), but Cassie Clare did a good job of wrapping it all up in a neat bow. She also managed to surprise me a few times, as well as make me feel, happiness and sadness, for the characters which was highly appreciated. I'm not sure how I feel about the ending, there were parts where I loved it, the pacing the near-tears emotions it evoked, and times I felt that there's no way things would be that smooth or ""easy."" 
 The writing wasn't perfect, the editing needed work (I know they're brothers, but Gideon and Gabriel's names shouldn't be interchanged, even once), and there were happy endings aplenty (among the sad), but the story itself did not disappoint and I'm happy to have been introduced and emotionally attached to these characters."
2,"I would probably give this book 2 1/2 stars. Maybe it was just the timing, but I did not enjoy this book as much as I expected. It was long and the ever-changing viewpoints got on my nerves. I liked the overall concept of the story and felt that there were some great characters. The songs/poems and speeches that were interspersed throughout the book became tedious as well. 
 Because I did like elements of the story, I would consider this author again."
4,"It's no secret that Tessa Dare is on my auto-read list. She gives me the historical romance that I love, but always with wit and steaminess and a modern sensibility. And the premise behind When a Scot Ties the Knot is one of my favorites: a correspondence to an imaginary fiance who turns out to be not so imaginary. I love this specifically because it does a thing I love in romance novels. It takes the hero and the heroine and it jams them together in a tight space. It takes away a lot of that ""will they, won't they"" stuff, which is good because it's a romance novel. Of course they will. What Tessa Dare manages to do so well is to accelerate that intimacy without sacrificing any of the tension. 
 And sure, maybe it's less than charming that the hero shows up with blackmail in mind, but in the end I got his motivation. Not a deal breaker for me, especially since he was a perfect gentleman in every other respect. 
 Biggest bonus of all: the heroine. Madeline is a science nerd, bluestocking, and feminist of the first order. I love that she unknowingly woos the hero by sending him drawings of bugs. I love that she obsessively monitors the life cycles of her pet lobsters. (Tessa Dare is awesome at finding hysterical pets.) Best of all, I love that she's made a career out of her artistic ability and science nerdiness, and that sacrificing that career isn't even considered by either Madeline or Logan. 
 This is a delicious book, and maybe my favorite Tessa Dare book yet.

2,"This book was just... so-so. And definitely overrated because it's John Green (the Obama of authors) and David Levithan (Obama's wingman), but the combination of the two? Eh. I could have definitely lived without reading this book and the gay musical that took up way too many of its pages. While I appreciate the initial thought - two guys with the same name whose lives intersect - the execution was really just kind of puzzling. And a waste of time."
5,"What an amazing middle grade novel! 
 I read this aloud with my two 10 year olds over the course of two sittings. We loved the story of Nicholas and his stubborn determination to stand up for his beliefs, to not be afraid to make changes and be different. Besides being fascinated with the story, we had so many great conversations about word origins, the history of the dictionary, what is takes to stick up for what you believe in, and so much more. After reading the book, we were able to see the play Frindle which was excellent, even leaving me shedding a few tears at the end, which I rarely ever do. 
 I'd highly recommend reading this story, especially if you read it along with a child in your life."

 I really like books set in virtual reality or games which is why I was looking forward to this book. Lu has always written interesting novels though there is always something missing that stops me from falling in love with her novels. While I enjoyed Legend and Prodigy, I have no urge to read Champion anytime soon. Similarly, While I enjoyed the Young Elites, I am in no rush to pick up the sequels while I do think this series has more potential than Legend. The reason why I am focusing on informing you about Lu's previous work will be revealed.....

5,"What a FABULOUS book - great narrative, beautifully written, utterly captivating, a highly intelligent novel. After reading that abysmal Ken Follett book (Pillars of the Earth), I really felt like I needed something to cleanse me of that dross. Since every review I read about this book pointed towards the positive, I gave it a shot. And what a surprise - I was so completely drawn to it that I finished it in 2 days. I couldn't put it down. In fact, I didn't want it to end. I kept going back to certain passages in the text, trying to prolong the story, all the while reinforcing my understanding of these characters and their experiences. 
 Donoghue is one of those gifted writers - for his first effort as a novelist, this work was just absolutely wondrous. He wrote simply but effectively; he didn't have to resort to outlandish drama or hyperbole. No elaborate plot twists, no florid writing. Just simple storytelling, honest, sometimes raw, drawing on emotions both primitive and complex. He didn't have a need to spell everything out or to tie everything neatly into one square package (he may actually be one of those writers who truly believes that not every particular in a story has to be explained - that mysteries serve a purpose, and that some mysteries are better left undiscovered). Most importantly, he made no assumptions of the reader (I really hate it when writers dumb things down to appeal to all readers, or are so disdainful of ""regular"" readers that they ostracize them with their condescending tones and know-it-all attitudes) - he just wrote. 
 It was highly literary - no more so than when two of the changelings discover the library and the wonders within - but it was also accessible. There was enough explanatory material that you didn't feel like you were hobbled by what you didn't know. The corollary to that is also true: that if you did know a good amount about any of the topics in the story, that there was still something you could learn. The entire narrative was a study in dichotomies: the weaving of the two stories, the two different points of views, mortal vs. immortal, young vs. old, wild vs. civilized. The narrative was the epitome of the yin-yang. After all, these two stolen children made up one person, one complementing the other, each one incomplete until their stories and lives commingled at the end. By that point, each one was ready to move on, having accepted their natures and the roles they played in each other's lives."
3,"2.5 Too much feisty, not enough feminism for my taste: the heroine, Kim, sasses with the best of them, but the text gives her little to no opportunity to make any decisions of her own."
2,"I think maybe I just don't like ""Chick Lit"". I didn't like the two books I read by Curtis Sittenfeld, and I didn't really like this one. 
 It's not that it's bad. It's just not what I'm looking for. I found the action in the story to be limited, and often not very interesting. The main way in which I engaged with the characters was to feel frustrated with Ellen for her continued insistence not to be honest with her husband, her sister, her friend, her ex, herself...anybody. It just got tedious. She just seemed whiny to me, and a whiny main character isn't all that compelling. My kids whine, and I love them, but not because of their whining. There's more to them than their whining. I couldn't really say the same about Ellen. 
 Speaking of which, I never felt convinced that the main character's name was Ellen. She didn't seem like an Ellen to me and Giffin didn't really manage to help her grow into her name. Giffin dropped names throughout the novel, as though deeper meaning could piggyback into her story via the significance of a name. But simply saying, ""Tribeca"" or ""Astoria"" or ""Mellow Mushroom,"" or having the characters discuss Elizabeth Smart in a passing way doesn't give the story more significance. On the contrary, as far as Elizabeth Smart goes, I thought this casual mention of a horrible ordeal endured by a living young woman was distasteful and only served to solidify my impression of the characters---all of the characters---as superficial and shallow and basically not people I would want to know in real life. 
 In addition, the book was written in present tense, something I strongly dislike. I consider it, often, to be a device employed for the purpose of bringing a sense of urgency and tension to a novel. But if that tension couldn't exist in the past tense, then present tense alone isn't going to suffice. 
 All in all, I just found the book to be flat. At one point I thought, Well, it seems like this book is almost done. But then I found that I was only about halfway through, and I felt disappointed that I still had that much more to read. My husband suggested that I just call it quits and move on to another book. I didn't dislike it that strongly. It's not even an active dislike at all, just a lack of ""like."" Like plain Cream of Wheat. Nothing to offend, but nothing to love. 
 I think this could be decent airplane reading, though, and it does address issues of infidelity and the way that sometimes we can confuse a nostalgia for the past for a longing for a change in the present. I just think it could have been done better."
3,"3 stars. It was a nice story of second chance love. But I found it a little tedious. Sometimes I don't need to hear every word of every conversation. More internalization. I know some if this is just the style, but really Emma and Luke were pretty boring."
3,"I almost didn't finish this book. I had high hopes since it was on the best seller list, but I found myself disappointed. I follow a 50-page rule and after 50 pages, I still wasn't hooked on the book. First of all, I didn't care about the characters. At the beginning, the characterization was flat and I thought the author should have developed them better early on. Second, I found the alternating POV very distracting and made the suspense drag. I kept reading because I still wanted to know what happened. it finally got some momentum for a while, but the ending was a disappointment. it was one of those hum-drum endings that made you wonder why you even bothered to read it. i gave it three stars because of the moments it actually kept my interest and I've read worse."

Utilizing his limited experience and unique perspective and skills, he bravely journeys beyond his known and familiar environment. A charmingly told tale, this story reminds the reader that those with differences have serious challenges assimilating, and that their well-meaning families and communities genuinely struggle in trying to help them.

 Actual rating: 2.5 stars 
 I'm a bit torn over this book. There are parts that are really enjoyable and I was indeed drawn into the story, but there were also issues which took me out of the story. 
 Kelsea is wonderfully flawed, but she knows it. Most of the time when she's vain, or concerned with the physical appearance of herself and others, she knows she's being petty. Once she begins to spend time around men, she begins to admire them; however, I don't find her love for the Fetch believable in the least (view spoiler)[(she barely knows him, and when they met he'd threatened to kill her) (hide spoiler)]. I do think Kelsea is well-suited as a Queen because she stands up for others and isn't afraid to tell off those who question her. It was wonderful to see her taking control of things and getting stuff done. But something really irked me: (view spoiler)[her cruel opinions of Lady Andrews. The woman may not be kind and she's very greedy, but she doesn't deserve to be treated with cruelty because Kelsea thinks Lady Andrews ugly while Lady Andrews is confident in her looks. It just grated on me a bit. (hide spoiler)] 
 (view spoiler)[The Fetch is a curious character, mostly because he stole the other sapphire from Kelsea and I don't see the purpose of this. He saves her life then threatens her life until she passes a test (odd, but interesting). He's ambiguous, but seems to be supporting Kelsea (despite the aforementioned theft and death threat). (hide spoiler)] 
 The biggest issue with this novel is the world-building. Johansen tried to make the setting a dystopia, in a sense; there are modern elements which suggest a futuristic setting, but otherwise the setting is quite medieval. There's no explanation for the Crossing or why there's been a huge regression with technology and society. So, whenever something modern was mentioned - like eBooks, J.K. Rowling, watches, etc. - it took me out of the story. It's so frustrating because these modern references don't fit with the setting or the story at all, and it only confused me since nothing is really explained about how the world got to be this way. I'm not convinced Johansen made a good decision in trying to make the story a dystopian one. All it served to do was confuse me and take me out of the story. 
 Another weak aspect is the switching point of views. It was not necessary to randomly have other POVs, and doing so added very little to the progression of the plot. Sure, it did give more dimension to the Regent, Kelsea's Uncle, but that character didn't come off as super important to the story, so I don't think we needed to see that (view spoiler)[his mother hated him so now he treats women with cruelty. (hide spoiler)] I'm also not convinced that Brenna was a necessary character when she appeared in only one scene and literally just sat there and did inappropriate things in public. What was the point of that, Johansen? And, finally, these particular sections also did not have consistent construction of the Red Queen. Not at all. 
 Overall, The Queen of the Tearling is a good book, if you can ignore the weak world-building and other issues."

 CAN I just say that this Series is by far, One of the best series I have ever read ? Let's start with the previous 3 books which was so intense but at the same time sweet. This book, however, is intense and romantic and sweet altogether and it made me swoon. Literally, swoon over the characters. I love Katy Evans and her books. She was one of the first Authors who wrote books that I instantly like and believe me, no bias there. If you've read Real, Mine and Remy you would understand me. 
 I like the way she hunts for her next man;I liked watching because somewhere, deep down, I knew I'd have enough, and her hunt would be over the day I decided to let her know I intended to be that man. FUCK HER PRINCE CHARMING. She's getting me. 
 ""Melanie, I'm Greyson King and I'm your man ."" 
 King, Greyson King, Greyson King. Even his name screams Alpha Hot. In my view, I think Greyson is very determined in everything he does. His Father wasn't really a father to him and to him he was more like a heir than a son but he follows him anyway cause for years his main goal has been to find his mom. His very particular about the people he trusts and he likes to test them. Being back in business means his father needs him and by being back means finally seeing his mother whom he'd been secretly tracking for years. And being back in business means tracking people, tracking Melanie. It took him One taste of Melanie and she instantly became his drug. He's very confused about his feelings given that it was the first time he felt such strong pull towards the opposite sex. Melanie gives him life, she is his everything though they both aren't sure how fast it happened but who cares? They both want each other and just knowing that Melanie is going to be his home, that gives him even more life than ever. 
 ""Just answer me this. Are you my girl?"" ""First tell me you're my guy."" She misses me. 
 ""I feel like my boyfriend just died. I will never, ever, have Greyson anymore."" If I sound sad, he looks wrecked . ""I feel like my alias just killed my girl. And she'll never look at me the way she did before."" 
 Melanie is more like a fairytale believer. She wants her true love and she she's been looking for it for a long time and now Brooke is getting married before her. Her best friend who was shy and has less encounter with me. How was she not married yet? She doesnt know. Or maybe she does. In the way I see it, she sleeps around hoping that the next guy she sleeps with will be the ONE, her forever, the who would give her THE LOOK that Remy gives her best friend and so far the guy who had given her that had been Greyson. The guy he just met in a rainy night on the club. The guy who caught her eye and the guy who doesn't seem like the forever material. Damn. But she could feel it. The want. The confusion. The feeling of being important to someone. She knows Greyson isn't the settling type but oh how the world goes round and she changes it. 
 ""Why do you want my arms?"" he whispers in my ear. ""I just told you they've done more harm than good."" ""Not to me."" ""Because you fell for me, you fell for me and all my bullshit, and even with everything I just said, you're still falling, aren't you,"" he rasps. He kisses the back of my ear. ""I'm right here to catch you."" He kisses the back of my ear, harder. ""Let me catch you."" 
 I love the story. Honestly, it's not just romance but family. Greyson's life is not normal but he can;t change it and he knows he isn't good for Melanie but he wants to be. Then there's his father, the man who brought everything to him. The pain, the missing life piece, the regret was all because of him and Melanie was also because of him. What really interested me the most is how he is going to deal with Melanie on the List, He's been assigned to do something and he chose to put Melanie on the last number because he likes her. Even before they met he's been watching her and I find that really sweet. The romance in this book is never ending, even the Erotic scenes are very promising. 
 ""Is that what I am?"" ""A distraction? You're my fucking obsession ."" 
 Melanie getting scared cause she finally found the one. Her friends being outspoken of what they thought. And Greyson confusing her was a very fun read. She's frustrating sometimes but she is also frustrated most of the time. While Melanie is being open about everything, Greyson is just as close. His battle between himself about being with Melanie or not is so funny that I had to plaster a smile when it comes to his POV. 
 She makes me fucking hot. Hard. Possessive. Protective. What the fuck? 
 I'm giving it a Five stars cause it's worth the 5 stars. I couldn't even express how excited I was when I pre-ordered this book. I am in love with the characters and I know I will be more crazy in love in the next book cause it just gets better and better. And I don't always feel like this, just to those books that really caught me. 
 I'm sick and she's the only cure. I'm sick for her, as sick as my father. 
 I want him to crave me like a feast. And take me like a beast."
3,"I have ruminated on this. I mean, SEP is kind of a phenomenon, right? Not so much this side of the pond (where romance is a somewhat sidelined genre of literature in general and thus no one is really a phenomenon) but in the States she's like a Big Deal? I certainly cannot remember the last time I read a book with Good Reads reviews of 20K+. So I suppose my expectations were high and this ended up on my TBR pile somehow, so some blog or reviewer I respect must have liked it. But I've got to say, it left me cold. The writing is good. Philips can do banter, I'll give her that and she sets a scene well. But I didn't feel a connection with the book at all and the romance just didn't do anything for me. Add into all that I had some serious suspension of belief issues. The multi-zillionaire (American) football player running into the broke zany artist and keeping her around seemingly just because she can pick on him in a witty way and then they fall into an angry sex kind of relationship. Then there's the Rocker Dad and the groupie Mother and the half-sister and the southern dragon lady in the cutesy town at the cutesy farm. And So Much Happening, my God. I was exhausted. The beav and her ex, the mum pretending to be the decorator and the sister running away, the dad showing up, the parental secondary romance, the kid sisters singing, the whole thing with Nita and owning the town and the paintings and prison at the end. Just: enough already. If I wanted this much going on I'd watch a glossy American soap or something. At least part of the reason the romance was lost on me is that the romance got lost amongst all of the other stuff going on. That said, I did read the whole thing. I didn't skim but it all felt like a bit of a slog. I can't say that I'll be hunting out any Philips in the near future off the back of this."

 So jealous! I want my childhood days to be like yours.(: 
 That Boy 
 was a fun read, it was quite entertaining. Though I felt that it lacks the emotion that should be when (view spoiler)[her parents died, (hide spoiler)] I wasn't convinced that the scene was real..and that's what I'm really looking in a book..that the characters are able to convey their emotions in every scenes to the readers (or basically just convince me) as if they were real. I also find her a bit flirt..from one guy to another, as if she was just changing her clothes. A lot of kisses from different guys. 
 But All in all, I still enjoy the story and would recommend this book to people looking for light story (:"

 How many times in your life have you been close to death? What would the world be like if you could cause a bad thing to happen in order to prevent a worse thing? Kate Atkinson prompts the reader with these questions in Life After Life. 
 Ursula, the story's main character, is only vaguely aware that she is living the same life repeatedly, claiming to get a queer feeling of deja vu when approaching situations that she has lived before. With the exception of an exciting opening scene, the novel is told in chronological order, Ursula taking center stage. 
 Until the first repetition happens in the plot, the progression of events feel almost mundane. The matter-of-fact point of view refers to Ursula's mother as Sylvie, her father simply as Hugh, and gives each character their own unique personality. The story starts with Ursula being strangled by her umbilical cord because a doctor was late in arriving. We later get the same turn of events except the doctor arrives on time, cutting the umbilical cord around Ursula's neck. Ursula's childhood is dangerous, complete with a vivid and horrifying depiction of drowning, remedied later by a stranger who rescues her and yet another accidental death where she ventures onto an icy roof in search of a doll that her brother had thrown there. The scenes are at first confusing, the repetition following without explanation, but soon the character becomes self-aware of these multiple realities. 
 While this strange reliving of Ursula's life is interesting, it fades easily into the background of an intense character study. The book's main focus in its characters, examining Ursula the hardest, but also putting the rest of the novel's familiar faces through several possible scenarios to see how they might react. Slyvie seems for the most part to be a caring and supportive mother until one of Ursula's realities puts her in a trying and unfortunate situation. The caring mother is gone and Slyvie's cruelty is revealed until Ursula is able to rewind time once again, choosing a different path. One of Ursula's siblings, a lovable and sweet character, dies first as a child, yet appears later as a dead war hero, remembered fondly by everyone."
4,"After Trace left her to go to rehab, Kylie survived on her own singing, making songs and being the top artist she always dreamed of. But she can't feel any happiness on what's going on around her. She feel numb. Ever since Trace left, the only way she knew how to cope is to feel numb, build walls around her and never to trust anyone again with her heart. The old Kylie was gone, and took her place is the top artist who only knows how to work, and doesn't have fun. 
 Good thing she has found true friendship with Lulu, Lily, and Mia (unexpectedly). Steven and his band. With their help, Kylie made it through almost a year. But she knows the pain is still there, and being numb is the only way not to feel that pain. Until, Trace returned, out from rehab. And now, their label wants them to be on tour together. Will Kylie be able to keep herself from feeling once again? Will Trace be able to take her back? This is the 3rd and Final Instalment of Kylie Ryans Series. 
 I knew it when I said book 2 will kill me from its ending. Good thing I have this book on hand. I immediately grabbed this book right after I finish book 2. I guess my sleeping for tonight will be out of the question. Anyway, I'm sure this book is worth it. 
 I felt sad for Kylie. She's so heartbroken and feels so alone. I guess I would also feel that same if someone like Trace did that to me. I also get her point that it's not just the ""I'm going to rehab you can't wait for me"" line of Trace that made her feel betrayed. It's something more. It's that, when the going gets tough, it's not her that Trace trust to handle him. It's not her that he runs to talk about his fears and problems. For someone like Kylie who loved Trace unconditionally, that stings a lot. 
 I still don't like Trace. Regardless of how many times this story say how hot he is, I just can't feel that attraction. Or maybe I'm not just into that mature guys. I prefer Steven actually. If he's not totally into another woman (which I also grew to like), I would definitely root him for Kylie. Kylie experienced so much during the year without Trace, and I feel like it's so unfair for trace to suddenly pop out and ruin everything. I totally believe that Trace doesn't have the right to treat Kylie like that. Leaving and breaking her heart then when he's okay, take her back. Even if he says it's best for her, I think Kylie deserves better than that. But since these two are the lead, I would have to settle for less and be satisfied with their story. 
 Trace's saving grace would be his patience and determination to take Kylie back. His love for her is undeniable, and I find it cute. I love cold Kylie here, she tried her best to keep away from him, unsuccessfully obviously but I admired her for trying. Besides them, I have enjoyed Lulu and Mia's character. Totally opposite but they have showed their loyalty and friendship to Kylie, and I love them for that. The lyrics for the songs are amazing, I hope I could really hear them in the radio. 
 It's a push-and-pull relationship between Trace and Kylie, but it fits the story too well. And in the end, it's just perfect for these two. The epilogue is great, I love how I had a glimpse of the ""after."""
4,"I didn't expect at all the second half of the book, who knew it was a fantasy book ? Not me. 
 This story was adorable, the beginning made me laugh so much I had tears in my eyes, Matilda is such a lovely little girl and she doesn't deserve to be treated the way she is by her parents. 
 I liked the fantasy aspect, it was really funny to read, and the end - even though it was a bit written in a rush for me - was really enjoyable.

 Full review to come. As soon as I manage to process my thoughts and feelings."
5,"Another brilliant book by the brilliant P. K. Dick! 
 This was a story about death, or rather, half-death and what happens when someone's consciousness gets trapped in their body right after their death, without it being able to get free, at least for a certain amount of time. And what said consciousness experiences as reality as a result and how this reality starts to fade -or rather recess- into a purely archetypal form. And how one may -or may not- manage to cope with this state of existence. 
 This was also one of the best literary descriptions of how the astral plain of archetypes, sentiment and form work and how scary such a place can become if someone gets stuck in it one way or another. 
 An amazing work of art, highly recommendable!"
4,"So after jumping right into Book 2 after finishing the first one, I got to say Liz, the heroine, went from sarcastically funny to downright harpy and annoying for quite some time, folks. Instead of relating to her dismay at being unwillingly tagged as the future mate to the imposing, alien of few words, somewhat disfigured virgin hero, thanks to a parasite worm forced upon her in order to keep her alive, I found myself feeling more sorry for him having to put up with her than vice versa. Fortunately, she did eventually snap out of her contrariness and realize this ""just wants to be loved and have a family"" guy desperately wanted his feelings to be reciprocated. Yeah, this love struck alien would gladly hand her the two moons and sun if he could. 
 Of course, the hero had his ""shouldn't have done that"" moments, as well. Like intimately touching her while she was asleep and recovering from an ordeal. 
 Make no mistake this is an erotic read. In fact, compared to the first book the smexy scenes were hijacking the storyline more often than not once Liz finally gave in. With a ""be careful what you wish for"" twist of fate, Liz finds herself having to manipulate people and circumstances in order to get what she really wants, a certain blue eyed, blue bodied alien alpha male. 
 With a tad towards leaning a little on the overly drawn out side, along with over usage of the term ""cooties"", I'm a little concerned this commonly shared plot theme may start to wear thin through so many sequels. Time will tell as I hope to keep sampling the HEAs in this sci-fi romance series. The premise of resonating and the HEAs with aliens who seem to appreciate having a soul mate will likely keep me coming back for more.

4,"Forman has a gift with words and I was drawn into this story quickly. I couldn't put it down until I finished it! Allyson & Melanie have been best friends since they were small. When their parents send them to Europe for the once in a lifetime vacation after graduation they learn quickly that not everyone is as they appear. Mel has decided to reinvent herself and convinces Allyson to cut off her hair. Allyson is not as brave as Mel and doesn't have as good of a time. She doesn't enjoy going out to the pubs and is a little disappointed in the sights. Until she meets Willem. Willem is in a play that he invites them both to attend. When they just happen to run into one another the next morning he asks her to spend the day in Paris and renames her Lulu because she looks like some actress Louise. Allyson is used to walking the straight and narrow, but even she can't deny the attraction to Willem. She agrees and they have an amazing time together getting lost in the city. When Allyson wakes up the next morning to find Willem gone it breaks her heart. She thought they had more than just a fling and nearly a year later she still isn't over him. 
 ***Spoilers*** 
 Allyson goes on to college but is depressed and failing her classes. She and Mel have drifted apart and she feels more alone now than ever. Her mother is a control freak and feels she has to have her hands in every aspect of Allyson's life. After speaking with a counselor who convinces her to take the classes she wants to take, not her mother, she starts to find herself. She then goes on to tell her mother she isn't going to be working for any doctors over summer break, but instead is going to Paris. Her parents refuse to pay for it and her mom is not happy.

She goes all over following different clues until she finds out he was attacked that morning but did leave her a note. He ended up in the hospital and the Dr remembers him being agitated because he had to get back to someone. He agrees to give her the address he left when he was there. She follows it to Holland and then she sees him after a play in the embrace of another girl. She decides to leave it alone but the next morning she changes her mind. At the end of the book she shows up at his apartment and he invites her in. The next book doesn't have a release date, but it will be in Willem's pov."

 ""This book had me hooked from the beginning. I have never read a book so beautifully written that it just fell together like a movie. The writing in this book is superb and Ms. Taylor sure does bring these alternate worlds alive with the stroke of her pen. The YA genre is littered with paranormal books and then every so often you find a book that makes you say where have you been all my life and this is exactly what Ms. Taylor did. The plot was amazing and I never saw what was coming! It was easy to follow and never waned to a point where I felt the story was becoming boring. The parts where it slowed down were still exciting and enticing all at the same time. 
 The characters in this book were amazing and intriguing with just the right amount of drama that didn't make it seem like it was a YA book at all. I loved reading about the growth of the characters and watching them develop. Karou was amazing and my heart wept for her as things began to unravel and she kept talking about her vast feeling of emptiness and Akiva with his hallowed soul and hatred towards all things unlike him. I loved all of the chimera in the book and by far Brimstone became my favorite; he was amazing in what he tried to do. Issa was great and the perfect balance of comedy to add to the book, Issa delivered such a light heartiness that it had me wishing for a friend like her. 
 The story was beautifully told and I just can't stop saying that. When people ask me about the book I blush and say it was beautiful. The world that Ms. Taylor developed had me looking at shadows differently the sky in a new way and wishing that something so beautiful could really be seen. The world jumped off the page and it hasn't left me yet. I am excited to read the other books in the series as the ending slayed me and left me reeling. I believe everyone should pick up this book because you have no clue what you are missing and when you finish come back so I can hear how much your enjoyed it."

 really enjoyed this book can't wait for ""Devoted"" :D 
 - richard"
4,"I admit that I enjoyed this one more than I thought I would. It's not my first steam punk/zombie mash-up, and it's certainly not my first young adult book. I've come to have low expectations from most young adult books - too much angst, whining, or really stupid decisions that put the protagonist in peril. This book certainly had the teenager, Zeke, making really stupid decisions, but the entire premise is based on his first really stupid decision to go into the walled city full of poisonous gas, ""rotters"" (aka zombies), and unsavory humans on some ill-thought-out quest to redeem the memory of his father. 
 But this book had something else - the mother's POV. I actually think that Briar was the main focus of this book, not her son. That's rare for the young adult genre. Briar was far more interesting to me than Zeke, which is one reason I'm rating this so highly. We learn that she's the daughter of a hero/villain - a lawman who died saving a bunch of prisoners from the spreading blight. We also learn that she's the wife of the guy who's Boneshaker machine destroyed much of downtown Seattle and released the subterranean gas that created the rotters. Briar goes into the walled part of Seattle to try to save Zeke. Along the way she turns into a kick-ass hero, and we also learn the truth behind her years of silence about her husband. All of this makes her compelling. 
 The characters they meet inside the walls, and the airship captains and their crews, were all interesting and really added to the story. 
 The ending was an true ending and not a cliff hanger set up to force readers to get the next book. Yes, we are left with some unanswered questions and I'd really love to know the fate of a few of the side characters. I'd also like to know what happens next for Briar and Zeke. I like that the story ended leaving me wanting more, without being an obvious ploy to get me to buy the next book."
4,"Simply outstanding. I have NO qualms about putting this on my ""highly recommended"" list . I must admit that while the premise sounded intriguing, I was a little skeptical about how she was going to handle this novel, but the author came through and totally exceeded my expectations. Congratulations; what an fne story and good writing as a bonus! 
 I'll try to briefly synopsize the story, but it won't do it justice. You need to go read it to get the full effect. 
 On page 421, a Catholic nun is speaking to a rabbi, who tells her ""no matter how dark the tapestry God weaves for us, there's always a thread of grace."" This story is about that thread of grace held out to almost 50,000 Jews by the Italians after the 1943 Yom Kippur roundup of Jews in Nazi-Occupied Europe. It is the story of a few people whose efforts likely spared lives that otherwise would have been lost in the Nazi death machine -- and these people, I would say, are representative of others who put forth the same effort and humanity. I mean, really, the author couldn't take the time to hunt down each and every story, so she let her few characters tell it. 
 The action is focused around one town, Porto Sant'Andrea, a small town on the Ligurian Coast of Italy. The news at the time at the beginning of the novel is that the fascists have fallen in Italy, and that (wrongly) the war is over there. This news leads to an influx of thousands of Jewish refugees from all over Europe. However, what they fail to realize is that the Nazis are moving into Italy as an occupying power, and that the danger is far from over. Many Jews, for various reasons, who are already living in Porto Sant'Andrea decide to stay and do what they can to help the refugees and the Italian Jews of the town who have chosen to seek shelter. 
 Two of these key players are Renzo Leoni (one of my absolute favorite characters), who served in the Italian Air Corps and led a bombing run in Ethopia, and his mom, Lidia, who has communist leanings and believes in the equality of women. Renzo is a substantial force in creating a network of sympathizers including priests, nuns, partisans, villagers who've had enough of the fascist regime and have no love for the Nazis, and other Jews in hiding to not only protect refugees but to also try to do their part in eliminating the Nazi threat in their area. Another player is Werner Schramm, who was a doctor working for the Nazis and has not reported back to duty, and who has his own personal demons to deal with. 
 Each character is realistic; each has something to offer wholeheartedly to the story, and I have to admit...before the end of the novel, I had to fight my urge to flip to the back to see which of the characters were still there at the end of the story -- that's how real they became to me. I absolutely hoped that my favorites were spared by the time it came to the last part of the novel. 
 I cannot begin to tell you what a wonderful, thought-provoking, well-researched novel A Thread of Grace is. Simply one of the best novels I've read in a very long time."
5,"5+ Stars. Once I started reading I couldn't put it down. I thought a novel dealing with the ins and outs of the financial world would make me skim pages, but my attention was held from the first. This brilliant novel is exactly what I was hoping for when I saw who'd written it. I've become a huge fan of Voinov after the Special Forces and Dark Souls series and can honestly say this novel exceeded all my expectations. Thank you for staying the course with these complex characters and going the self-published route. It would have been a crime to have this manuscript languishing in a drawer because it didn't ""fit"" the norm."
3,"This series just doesn't seem as fun as it did three or four books ago. The fact that Atticus finally caught a clue-by-four about what's been going on was great! But I was also thinking, Did it really have to take 7 books to get to this point???"
3,"Magical realism is one of those genres that I want more of but am also leery of because I tend to either really like it or I don't. When the Moon was Ours falls somewhere in between. 
 Where this book excelled for me was the characters. I'm trying to read more diversely and this book was absolutely beautiful. McLemore has not only included a cast of culturally diverse characters but of different sexualities as well and though I'm not a good judge of the representation, I thought she did a good job in my own opinion. 
 But the book fell a bit flat for me. I like magical realism but usually need a bit more of an explanation for the kind of ""magic"" included in this book. There were too many different things for me to just go along with it. And though it seems like a lot of people loved the writing style, I just... didn't. Wasn't for me. Nor did I find the plot terribly interesting. 
 The characters were wonderfully created and developed, but this just wasn't the book for me in terms of the writing and story, unfortunately."
5,"What a way to get back into reading and start the new year. 
 The story unravels at an intense pace, keeping me on edge as I try to delve deeper into the mystery. It is intriguing and captivating, and I was not ready for it to end. 
 The fact that I read it in one day says a lot and I am very much looking forward to the second book. 
 FULL REVIEW TO COME."
2,"** spoiler alert ** 
 Ki is a high-powered executive, utterly comfortable in social situations, and in bed with both men and women. Aaron is an IT worker in Ki's company who's cripplingly shy and sexually inexperienced. It takes a while, but when Ki finally makes a move, Aaron has spent enough time installing Ki's home electronics to feel comfortable saying yes to both Ki's advances and his own feelings. They have a long honeymoon period, but an unexpected party throws a wrench in their relationship. 
 Aaron's foolishness during and after the impromptu party I can chalk up to inexperience, jealousy, and social anxiety. So while it annoyed me--I dislike such lack of directness--his actions seemed in keeping with his character. Ki's temper and decision to pick up an old sexual partner were off-putting, though this, too, was in keeping with his character. 
 I suppose I expected their misunderstanding to be resolved more quickly, with less not-technically-infidelity, and firmer decisions. In that way the story mimicked real life: realizing and accepting what you really want can take time and serious thought. The beginning of the story made me think the rest of the story would be pretty light, though, with Aaron's awkwardness and Ki's experience blending to make a simple and sweet love story. I didn't expect the heaviness of them being separated for weeks, or of Ki sleeping with a woman to try to forget Aaron. 
 I also didn't entirely understand what attracted Ki and Aaron to each other, and think there were sex scenes (Ki always topping and firmly in control) where more direct character- and relationship-building scenes would have been more appropriate. To be honest, I didn't like Ki terribly much either. He seemed like a dominating, somewhat entitled, angry person. So while it annoyed me that Aaron was so comfortable running away, Ki's anger seemed dangerous to stay around, especially for someone so ridiculously shy and introverted."
2,"Bridget Jones worries about a lot of things, her weight, her job, her lack of a boyfriend and the amount of calories she consumes each day. As a late twenty-something, the pressure is on for Bridget to find a man and settle down, particularly as her family keep thrusting Mark Darcy upon her. Bridget, however, is in love with her boss Daniel Cleaver and it appears that he likes her, too. However, the relationship doesn't run as smoothly as you might expect and there are a lot of ups and downs. Is Daniel the man for Bridget or could it be Mark Darcy? 
 Although I've heard about Bridget Jones's Diary and seen at least one of the films (or maybe both - I can't remember either of them, though) I've never actually gotten around to reading the book. Which, according to some people, appears to be sacrilege. It just never took my fancy, no matter how much people raved about the book. I know, also, that it helped launch the genre I read so much of: chick lit, but again it never appealed. However after hearing how much Rhiana enjoyed it - and trusting her opinion, I finally picked myself up a copy and decided to give it a read. 
 I have to admit, that hours later, I'm failing to see what all of the fuss was about. I have got absolutely no idea why anyone thinks this is an example of good chick lit because, to be blunt, it's not. It might have been back when it was first released - in the 90's - but it doesn't seem to have aged well and there are tons of chick lit books I would place ahead of Bridget Jones's Diary. On the front of my copy, Nick Hornby says Helen Fielding is 'one of the funniest writers in Britain' but I didn't laugh once. Not at all. I have a very simple sense of humour but I didn't find Bridget Jones's Diary amusing in any way at all. 
 I thought the book was just plain annoying. For the first few diary entries, Bridget's weight and calories consumed and cigarettes/alcohol units was interesting but it soon became very dull and I just skipped those points completely. Mainly due to the fact that Bridget keeps saying it's 'bad' that she's - gasp - 9 stone. The fact of the matter is 9 stone isn't fat. At all. Unless you're really really short and Bridget just comes across as another thin woman thinking she's fat and it gets really irritating after a while to hear her moan and whinge about putting on a pound. I understand weight insecurities, don't get me wrong, but neurotic doesn't even cover Bridget. Any person over 9 stone reading this book will want to bash Bridget's head against a wall while simultaneously chucking away everything in their fridge because it's as if anything over 9 stone is horrifically obese. 
 I know a lot of women really love Bridget, but I really couldn't see her appeal. From her neuroses about her weight to her shallowness and vapidity, I just couldn't warm to her. All I did whilst reading the book was tolerated her because I had to; because she was the narrator. I didn't even really much like Bridget's parents either, in particular her mother. She wasn't particularly nice and her mid-life crisis (or whatever it was) was rather strange and she didn't really come across at all well. As for Bridget's dad I just thought he was a bit wet. As for the men in Bridget's life, I thought Daniel Cleaver was a rather nasty piece of work and was totally undeserving of Bridget. I may not have liked her, but I certainly didn't want her to end up with that idiot. I quite liked Mark Darcy, in fact he was probably my favourite character of the entire book, although I would have liked him to appear a bit more. 
 Bridget Jones's Diary isn't really that well written either - sure, I managed to read it in a fairly quick amount of time but that was only because I wanted it to end. I suppose the main problem with the writing is that Bridget just spends the entire book whinging and moaning. It's rather relentless not to mention the idiots her girl friends go out with. They all seemed rather doomed from the start to be honest. In fact, thinking back, the book is just plain boring. All about men, her weight, her job... and in the end, it's as if everything's just going around in circles. 
 I think the main reason a lot of people liked Bridget Jones is because it was the only book of its kind back when it was first released, hence the huge hype. I think it's definitely an over-hyped book and I think it's place as a classic chick lit book is more because it was the first than because it's a genuine chick lit classic. There are many better books in the chick lit genre and it's clear to see that the writing now compared to the 90s is just so much better and, for me, Bridget Jones's Diary lags far far behind."
4,"I know. I try not to read series that aren't complete, let alone just beginning. But come on, it's Kim Dare. Did anyone really suspect I could resist? 
 It was fantastic. It was filled with detail and depth. The story took me a few days to read, but it was well worth it. Kim did a wonderful job at focusing on the difference between the wolf culture and human culture. 
 We have Axel(in my head was Alex). He owns his bar, leader of a motorcycle club, The Black Dragons, which consist of all male gay members. He is also a single, and a Dom. A Dom that others want, but he doesn't want them. I loved him just as much as Bayden. He is honest, caring, loyal and when he loves, he loves fully and deeply. He isn't like other humans, who treat shifters differently. It isn't the the species that makes the person, it's their morals and personalities. Axel knows there are good men and bad men, just like there are good wolves and bad ones. 
 All Bayden wants is to find an Alpha he can devote himself. But in his family, he is the most dominate wolf. He loves fully and is a very devoted son and grandson. His grandfather is ill, and he isn't going to live for much longer and his mother lives and takes care of him. Sadly, the moment Bayden turned twenty-one, he had to move out. There are these ridiculous laws out there, anti-wolf laws. One of them is that three wolves cannot live together, because it will be viewed as a pack. Though, there is a place where female wolves can live together(because humans don't view them as dominants). 
 Bayden feels responsible to take care of himself and his family though. It's the only pack he's ever known and he was raised not to trust or believe in humans. They are all evil. He makes money through fights and bets. There is nothing he won't do. When he does them, he just goes on autopilot. Wolves heal fast. 
 Then one day he walks into Axel's bar and his (and Axel's) life is changed forever. He is drawn to Axel like a bee is to honey. Axel is everything Bayden dared to dream of. Strong, Loyal, Caring, Dominant. Despite him being human, Axel is every bit Alpha. Even that very first day, they are drawn to one another... craving something. 
 Bayden knows not to return, but he does. Time and time again. He doesn't want to disappoint Axel. He wants to always please him. He is a born submissive. It's more than just because of his wolfy instincts, it is who he is. He wants Axel to be his world and vice versa. But they have so many obstacles to overcome. 
 Wolves and Humans have many differences. Axel is willing... no a strong desire... to learn everything about Bayden. He isn't ashamed of Bayden's wolf. It is part of who Bayden is, someone that Axel can see by his side, someone he could see collaring. Which is in the same as a wolf claiming a mate. There is only one. 
 I can completely see why this story was so long. But it didn't feel long at all. It was needed. Axel and Bayden were very well written. Realistic. Neither were perfect, but they were made for each other. They had so many things against them, but Axel's club/friends were behind them. Though, some of Axel's friends were suspicious of Bayden at first, they soon learned that not all wolves are bad. 
 It was a fun journey, watching them go from skirting around the edges, to a relationship, to finally finding a peaceful balance for them. 
 This story ends very well. But I still am looking forward to see what happens next. Just becasue Axel and Bayden are doing well, their world still has anti-wolf laws and not everyone is as lucky as the two of them."

4,"I love this series and it never lets me down. And it didn't this time, either, though I did sense a change in tone. Johnson has a particular sense of humor that seems casual and learned at the same time. It is the result of thoughtful living, with the kind of distance that only long life can bestow. The same jokes or asides on the lips of a younger person would seem impertinent or studied, but somehow Johnson's observations bring to mind that old cowboy hat Longmire uses--capacious enough to keep off a cold rain, but bruised and ratty with time and has seen better days. 
 Our old man sheriff has changed a bit--more hardbitten, furious, and full of vengeance. He is less composed and sure of himself and knows perhaps too much of the range of human cruelty. As a result, he is jumpy when it comes to criminal acts, and doesn't always display that generous and reassuring control that I so appreciate in a law enforcement officer. He needs to be reminded to consider before exacting revenge for a loathsome act of arson. 
 Longmire references his mountain trip a few stories back in the series--the one where he very nearly met his maker--as a reason for his declining robustness and lack of patience when it comes to chasing suspects. He still takes extraordinary risks in his professional life: witness the fire rescue and facing the man who can throw a stiletto switchblade with uncanny accuracy. It is a little curious then, that Longmire doesn't display that same risk-taking behavior in his personal life and grab hold of the opportunity that his beautiful and beloved deputy presents. He should jump her bones, marry her immediately, lock in that elusive chance for romantic happiness. At his age he should know how rare and fleeting a thing it is to find love, and how easily it slips away."
3,"Too much Essos, but otherwise okay. I don't mind the new characters so much, and there were some nice kickers in the end."
4,"Re-reading this after over thirty years I was surprised how short it was but I still enjoyed the tale. 
 Telepathic powers mixed in with a post apocalyptic tale serving as an allegory for equality in a Fascist/religious oppressive dystopia"
3,"Shapeshifters and a romance? Hell yeahhhhhhh. 
 The story held a lot of potential to be great-- there are clans, there are packs, there are tensions rising and threats on the horizon. But ultimately, Leopard Moon was very limited in scope and played out more as a thriller romance than a kick-ass urban fantasy like I wanted and expected. 
 Don't get me wrong. I loved Cormac, totally book boyfriend material and the sweetest cinnamon roll. The romance developed slightly fast although I genuinely enjoyed the dance between Kess and him. 
 There were mentions of the other shifters -- were bears, were jaguars, were leopards... the glimpses into the world of paranormal were exciting because I thought that there would be so much more exploration of the supernatural, much to my disappointment. 
 I wanted to like this more. It wasn't a bad story, but mind blowing, it was not."
2,"i didn't really like it. I was so bored and i only finished it so i can get to the end which was obvious!! the romance was kind of mediocre, but i must be honest and admit that i enjoyed a little bit the last 30 pages but that was all!!"
4,"Reviewed by: Rabid Reads 
 I was excited to get a peek inside the mind of Owen Grayson and even though Kiss of Venom was short it most definitely was also sweet. Unlike many of Jennifer Estep's loyal fans, I didn't banish him from my herd of book boyfriend after his actions in Widow's Web. What can I say? People (and characters) do stupid things for love! 
 I like how in the opening chapter we first meet-up with Owen at Northern Aggression with Philip and he's drinking... you guessed it! Gin and tonic. I knew right then and there that this novella was going to be Grayson's chance to clear the air with readers before Heart of Venom officially hits the shelves. Anyway, while he's busy feeling sorry for himself, Estep decides to kick him when he's already down and in walks... the Spider. And oh, what an entrance! I loved seeing her through Owen's eyes. I already worship Gin as an Urban Fantasy heroine but the author's description from Grayson's POV was beyond memorable. 
 Between Owen's thoughts in this short and his actions in the upcoming installment, I think he and Gin will be on the mend very soon. I did find that his wallowing got on my nerves after a while though. I'm so used to seeing his strong side that it came as a bit of a shock to see him so down on himself. But, of course, no Elemental Assassin story would be complete without at least one murder and Grayson seems to have picked up yet another of Blanco's habits. He goes out clubbing with Philip and ends up killing 3 people! I'm sure he'd argue that he was ""protecting"" Gin. Yeah, like she needs any help in that department! Admit it Owen, you like being a bad boy. 
 Kiss of Venom ties in nicely with this series and provides answers to a few nagging questions. It's a quick read that no Elemental Assassin fan should miss."
3,"Entertaining and easy to read, but too superficial and obvious to be relatable or memorable"
5,"I'd been wanting to read this book forever now, and when I finally got my chance, it most certainly did not disappoint. God, I'm still reeling. The only complain I might have is the length. Besides that, perfection. Absolute perfection. (I NEED TO BUY THIS.) 
 We have our jock (Josh), our queen bee (Elaine), our sort-of popular chick (Kelsi), and our resident nerd (Kurt). Then, we have Alice, the believed slut, who supposedly slept with two boys in the same night, then one died, leaving Alice at the center of this school drama. The story is told through everyone's POVs, except Alice's, whose fantastic POV we get as a treat later on. 
 So I'm not usually a fan of rotating POVs, but this had me completely invested. And generally, I wasn't a fan of Kurt's side, so his chapters bored me a little, and he was kinda creepy with how he was constantly ogling Alice, but he grew on me, too. 
 Kids are cruel, that's the message, probably. Or homeschool your children. Kidding. But seriously read this book, you're definitely in for one hell of a trip with this one, especially if you were a lamebrain like me and kept out of the real-life school drama."
5,"Loved it, loved it, loved it! 
 Although I was born in the eighties, I'm really more a child of the nineties so most of the references were lost on me but still it was an amazing book. The passion with which he describes movies, videogames, authors and TV series is contagious and I've already watched Ghostbusters and played Space Invaders."
5,I loved Augustus. Finally an adorable fictional guy who's one of the main characters and who's not a jerk. :)
0,"A TIME TO DANCE is written in free-verse poetry and is a quick, easy read perfect for reluctant readers. 
 The words are beautiful and elegant and seem to capture the feel of the traditional Bharatanatyam dances described in this novel. It will enlighten readers to a topic that very few of us know anything about and offers a window into the Veda's Indian culture and faith. 
 Veda has the heart and soul of a dancer. When a car accident takes her foot, she has a fierce determination to dance again. With the aid of a prosthetic, she finds a new grace and beauty to her movements. 
 There is a budding romance that readers will enjoy. In addition, a deep appreciation for the spiritual side of dance and life. 
 Family plays an important role in this novel. Concepts such as karma, reincarnation are also touched on. 
 A valuable book that adds wonderful cultural diversity and experiences for readers."
4,"I have been seeing this book mentioned every where and I think almost every review has given it 4 or 5 stars out of 5 stars. So of course I had to pick it up but did so with some reservations. It seems like it never fails that books that other people love fall flat for me, perhaps due to all the hype raising my expectations. Fortunately this did not happen with this book. I gobbled up the story and could not wait to finish it to see just how the happy ending we all know is coming will pan out. Anna is pretty self-involved and has a habit of thinking the world revolves around her but I still enjoyed watching her experiences in France and the budding relationship with Etienne. Etienne on the other hand is the most lovable character you could meet. He's charming, handsome, sweet and has that one flaw of being short for a guy that keeps him from being irritatingly perfect. The only thing I have to say was strange was I had to keep reminding myself that these were all high school kids. They all come across as older and I would sometimes slip into the mind set that they were college seniors instead of high school seniors. Still a wonderful romance story that you should definitely pick up."
2,"Ugh....this book. I did not like this book. And in saying this, I'm not trying to anger all the people who think this book is amazing. I'm not trying to desecrate a childhood memory or a reading epiphany or a landmark in other people's lives. I'm just saying that, if The Fault in Our Stars is made of such revelatory moments, then they all went like 5 feet over my head. It may have been that I read this book as an experiment to see if I disliked it as much in theory as in practise. It may have been a classic case of the book versus it's hyped up alter-ego, but I just did not get why this book is such a big deal. 
 One thing I will say is that it was in places incredibly accurate. Having had a close relative die of cancer, I found that a lot of the book mimicked my experience - for instance, the episodes in which Hazel has fluid in her lungs are almost a mirror-image of what happened to the aforementioned relative, and so I appreciated that John Green did these experiences justice. 
 But, dear God, this book was pretentious. Any book that quotes T.S. Eliot, off-by-heart, in length, is going to be pretentious. I found the difference between Augustus' and Hazel's intended ages and what they said jarring. Not that I'm saying teenagers can't be this well-read and eloquent - I, and many people younger than me, understood what they were both saying - but I know some clever people and they tend to be the ones that speak in 'lols' all the time. Not many people speak in 'soliloquies'. I couldn't help but think that, had this book been written by a women, it was have been labelled purple prose. While TFIOS is much better written than, say, Stephenie Meyer's Twilight, the portrayal of teenagers, which has been slated in Meyer, was pretty much on parr - the only difference is that a) it's about something 'serious' like cancer rather than vampires, so the teenagers are allowed to be all deep and eloquent, and b) it's being 'literary'. The distinction irked me a bit, particularly as I found myself glazing over some of Van Houten and Augustus' longer speeches, whereas I remember being quite taken by Edward Cullen's archaisms. 
 I also felt that I didn't really 'get' the characters. Augustus and Hazel felt very one-dimensional to me - I couldn't really say much about them other than they like to read and they like to read fancy things. It was really strange to be in a story that focused so much on their intimate lives, to be in a story that is LITERALLY in Hazel's perspective, and not really feel like I know the people that they are talking about. And if I'm meant to feel like Green is making a point with the whole 'characters are scratches on paper' thing then that just backs up my pretentious point: I am not reading a YA romance for its metafictional superfluities. You are placing me in these characters' tragedies. You want me to cry when Augustus dies and when Hazel goes to his funeral. Make me care about the people that are dying or it will just feel (as this book did) that I am reading words on a page, and that just isn't that interesting. It's a detached process that doesn't mirror the messiness of grief and pain that Hazel was trying to articulate. 
 I guess what I'm trying to say is that I felt that John Green took an experience that I could relate to, and then made it unrelatable."
5,"Holy cannoli was this a good book! 
 It's a bit dated (obviously set in the 90's as the fashions will attest lol), but other than that, wow. 
 I don't normally intentionally read books involving infidelity, but I'm so glad I picked this one up. 
 It's very realistic -- all the bitterness and anger and hurt and resentment are illustrated beautifully -- from Rachel being angry with herself for letting them grow apart to her inability to climax during sex because whenever she gets close, she remembers/thinks about The Other Woman. 
 I won't give any real spoilers, because that would, well, spoil things *snerk* so I'll just say that it was a tough book, with tons of angst, a lot of self-realization, and an absolutely lovely ending. 
 5 Stars."
3,"I admit I was a bit disappointed. This book's reputation proceeds itself. I was expecting a masterpiece that would shake my soul, change my life kind of thing. Though the message, as well as the potrayal, is very powerful, I somehow got bored reading this."
0,"ETA: When I shelved this it was listed as #ReadWithoutPrejudice by Anonymous. 
 An interesting marketing gimmick: advance copies of the book were offered to bloggers and reviewers sans title or author, the point being to discern whether people would be able to, well, read without prejudice. I skimmed through the opening chapters of the book but couldn't summon up much interest, although I have to admit I didn't read enough to get a proper impression of what the story would be about; nevertheless, the writing didn't capture my attention. It's now been revealed that the book is the new one by Jodi Picoult - which makes me feel my immediate instincts were right. I guess this makes me one of those prejudiced readers, but I can't see myself giving it another go now. 
 (NB the reveal also makes the concept less interesting than I thought. I assumed the 'without prejudice' thing was to do with the reader not knowing anything about the race, gender, class etc of the author. It never occurred to me that the author would be someone who was already very well known.)"
3,"This short story focuses on the gap in Mark's story and what happened to him between the Arizona base incident and The Revenge of Seven. I enjoyed the story, but not as much as the first short story about Mark. With the first short story, you really just learned so much about Mark and he changed so much related to what was happening; however, in this story, Mark didn't really grow, it was just a continuation. The best part of this story was finally getting to me Guard. I am super excited to see how Guard is going to be integrated into the new book and how he/she will help up the Loriens. If you love the I am Number 4 series, I would say this is a must read."
3,"Mysterious letter, mysterious castle, paranormal trackers...good times at the Butterfly Castle. Liked the eerie, odd atmosphere and MC Anouk but odd flip in direction halfway through skewed the rating."
0,"Since I know the author's daughter, I'm probably a bit biased, but it still looks pretty good."
4,"4,5 stars because this is a beautiful book. But this book also has a suicide trigger warning. For me it was a little hard to read too especially in the second half because of that. But it also reminded me that it would not have been my fault and that is something that helped me too. 
 However, I really liked this book and Violet and Finch."
4,"I got this through a free-reads giveaway here at Goodreads, and am glad I did, for I might not have heard about it otherwise. I love well-written historical fiction--that is, historical that actually feels like it's happening in the here and now, with passions and senses and complex characters, and this is certainly such a novel. As someone soothed by the practice of gardening, I found it interesting and unique that an act of plant-obsession sets off such a violent chain of events in this novel, but I could certainly relate to the characters' love for flowers. And best of all was Swift's hand for writing characters: she did an excellent job looking through the eyes of each one, and making them all well-rounded humans, so that even the villainous scoundrels produced moments of sympathy or approval from me, and even the heroes had their shameful flaws. Just like, you know, real people! I'll be keeping an eye on Swift's work, and would love to follow her around while she examines gardens and old houses in England too. Who's going to spring for my plane ticket?"
4,"This was one of those really cute fluffy reads with so much cliches that we should hate but we just can't help but read. It was just adorable. It really was. If there is one thing that Sophie Kinsella knows how to do, it is fluffy books and fun dialogue. Honestly I spent most of the book snickering and giggling. I even laughed out loud at times which is rare for me. 
 Emma is a typical young adult. She is trying to find her place in this world. She also has a bunch of secrets she has kept from her friends, family and co workers. On a super scary plane ride, in a fit of panic, she tells a complete stranger every single little secret. Then that stranger turns out to be her boss. 
 Emma was fun. I love her dialogue and her thought process. She was completely irrational at times but she meant well. I enjoyed learning about all her secrets. In all honesty, her secrets weren't that bad but they did hurt the feelings of several people she knew. I was really rooting for her and Jack. They had such a fun chemistry even though it was kind of insta love. Sometimes, insta love isn't always a bad thing. 
 If you are looking for an in between book or a light read after reading some heavy stuff, I suggest this book. I finished it in about 3 hours (but I am an incredibly fast reader) so it honestly won't take long. Don't expect any deepness or anything like that. Just enjoy the ride of a fun, sometimes irrational young adult."
5,"I've had this on my kindle for a while. I have no idea why it took me so long to finally read but I'm so glad I did. It wasn't your normal Amy Lane book, most of her books are either Angst and Pain, or Sweet. This was a mix of the two with a fair bit of action thrown in. I absolutely adore the characters in this book and I just hope she plans to tell us more of their story in the future."
3,"You sit down on a big, comfy couch with your best friend, grab a cup of coffee and start to talk about your day. Your friend shares advice about life, love and work. It's friendly and fun, because it's familiar and you trust your friend's advice but don't take it too seriously. This is exactly what it was like to read ""How to be a Bawse"" by Lilly Singh. The anecdotal examples and beyond ordinary situations that lend themselves to the advice contained within are simultaneously the book's biggest assets and greatest weaknesses. 
 We'll start with the bad news: Lilly doesn't know her audience, or maybe she knows too well, but either way, the book comes across as being written for a much much younger reader. Filled with advice that someone in their late 20s (like myself) would hopefully have figured out by now, I can see how it might be helpful to someone just starting their career or entering high school. Also, at times Lilly speaks directly to the reader and sometimes addresses them as a parent, while other times addressing an elderly person (see pages 114 and 120). To say the least, it appeared as though the author did not have a good grasp on who her audience is, and while I can see she's trying to appeal to the wide range of people who might pick up her book, I personally found these asides to be very distracting and sometimes disrespectful (ageism much?). 
 The second thing I found to detract from the overall experience is how much anecdotal evidence Lilly includes when trying to prove her points. I really can't say enough about how far a little research goes and speak very highly of the well investigated Modern Romance by Aziz Ansari. Many times throughout Bawse I felt like I was listening to a self important girl, talk about how lucky they got that one time, and that's why you, the reader, should follow this advice. I would have liked to have seen her back up some of her points with statistics or journal articles. One example can be found in the first chapter called ""Play Nitendo"" in which Lilly talks about how viewing life as a video game can actually help you be a better strategist and let go of the things you can't control. I'm certain that this could have easily been supported by some study about the benefits of video games, yet there's no mention. I mean, I know it's a lot of work to include research, but that's what this entire book is supposed to be about; working hard! 
 Thirdly, I began to notice that most of the real gems of good advice that were included in the book often came from other people. About 90% of the ""Ah-ha"" moments I had when reading this came from the words of someone other than Miss Singh. One example is what Kate Winslet said in chapter 18; Trent Shelton in chapter 19; and even words from Snoop Dogg were more revelatory than anything written by the original author of this book. 
 I never really followed Lilly Singh's YouTube career and now I know why. At least in this book, she comes across as being a bit self-important. Putting pictures of herself on every page, proclaiming herself to be a ""bawse"" (I mean what even is that? Why not just say boss? She thinks she can make up new spellings to words and change the meaning?); and including examples of times she had to overcome a problem from when her assistant forgot to do something. I can't even get my mom to switch my laundry over and Lilly has an assistant? It was all just a little to much for me to believe or want to take advice from her. 
 The good news is that I think this book would be pretty good for her fans and the younger audience that might benefit from some of this advice without having to go through the lived experience of getting it, like I did. It was a bit repetitive near the end, what with 50 chapters being filled (I think there were three chapters including climbing some type of stair or ladder), but all in all I didn't hate this book. I just wouldn't recommend it to anyone over the age of 20. I hope you found this review helpful. If you did (or didn't) please let me know and tell me what book you want me to review next."
3,"I'm torn. My rating would be about a 2-1/2. I didn't have an issue with the writing style or quality, but something about this book just didn't ""fit"" for me. I'm no stranger to difficult or disturbing content, so that wasn't it. 
 The story covers an inordinately large amount of time. That was one issue for me. Perhaps, utilizing flashbacks or incorporating history via dialogue would have made the flow smoother? Not sure. 
 Next, the characters are...well, characters. Almost caricatures of what one would think of as typical MC hangers-on. There were interesting, frightening, and painful moments that resonated true to what life can be at times (namely, a bitch). However, those were but moments in this drawn out story. Some elements (anti-hero, consequences of choices) were beautifully portrayed, others fell flat. To sum it up, it felt like it was trying too hard (how many years in how many pages?). Some of the angst and heartbreak felt forced and disingenuous, but didn't wholly detract from those riveting scenes (you know, the train wreck that you can't look away from?). 
 Overall, I would look forward to reading more from this author."
5,"I just read the prologue here http://issuu.com/atriabooks/docs/walk... I cried, it was beautiful and sad. I cannot wait for this book, I want it now!!!"
4,"Actual rating: 4 
 I definitely enjoyed this one! The writing was great and addictive, the characters were flawed, but that's what made them realistic & human. 
 I feel like this could have been better if it was focused more on Chris and Donovan and their complicated past. I feel like a lot of the plot hinged on the relationship between Hosea and Theo, and since Hosea already had a girlfriend & was actually cheating, I couldn't sympathise or feel anything but anger and annoyance towards the relationship. 
 I liked the trial part of this, but I think it could have gone for more chapters than it did. The ending was satisfying, though I feel it was a little rushed. 
 Overall, I liked this! If you're interested in reading it, just be mindful that there are potential triggers. TW: eating disorders, rape, child sexual abuse."
4,Review to come.
4,"I first came upon this book through a Goodreads recommendation. I read the synopsis and instantly knew this would be my next read. After reading the synopsis, I knew the plot was something a bit similar to that of Delirium's by Lauren Oliver. While in Delirium, a procedure is done to remove the disease/feeling of love, The Program is done to remove memories of a person's past that may lead them to commit suicide. Even while reading the book, the similarities between the two novels were quite obvious, but I didn't really end up minding. The storyline was similar so obviously a few things had to be the same too, but I think otherwise Young was able to pull of a creative book in its own right. 
 The book was long. Or at least it felt long while I was reading it. The book is split into three parts, and while I really enjoyed each part, sometimes it felt like the parts were being dragged on for longer than necessary. Many emotions and statements were repeated over and over again, and made me wish that the author would just move on with the plot. 
 That being said, the book was actually pretty good. It was interesting to read, the characters were developed, and the book overall was well-written. The ending (view spoiler)[(again very similar to Delirium's ending, with the two main characters running off together in a sign of protest against the treatment), (hide spoiler)]left me wanting to read what would happen next. And of course, it just so happens that there is a sequel to The Program, called The Treatment, and it's releasing next month! 
 If you're interested in reading this book, I highly recommend it."
4,"An enjoyable story about a cowboy in the closet and an adorable young ranch hand. 
 Less crying in this story. It's a little more serious than the other works by the author but no less enjoyable for me. 
 I adore age-gap stories and this romance suited me just fine. Baxter is an asshole who keeps Matty dangling with his hot/cold actions. Despite being treated poorly, Matty just can't resist going back for more. I love that!"
4,Excellent audiobook. Another good book in the series.
4,"A very different story, indeed. I learned a lot about Islam and the art was so very beautiful. There was more nuditity and strange sexual(hmh, situations?)for my taste, but it compensated with a lot of wisdom in the end."
4,"I remember I found the plot fast, and not slow in the beginning. I hated how the protagonist said she was like completely invisible [it made sense later on but very frustrating at first],and yeah.Oh I forgot. SOME SCENES WERE SOOOOOOO HOT!"
4,"I liked this second book less than the first. Not because if was bad, but because I was expecting much more! 
 Yeah, I know, I know... 
 Anythow, the book is interesting, sometimes fun and not at all TSTL moments in it! 
 I liked the characters too, most of all Lady Wellingtonia! WOW, what a dragon-lady! 
 There're a ton of hints of a case of lust/attraction between Stoker and Veronica, but nothing really comes out of it (view spoiler)[apart from a kiss when Veronica is opium stoned... *fan, fan, fan* (hide spoiler)]. 
 The mistery is interesing and convoluted. It starts slowly, with little clues, but, as the story progresses, it becomes more and more intriguing! The culprit is a realy surprise! 
 Also in this book, both Veronica and Stoker keep their secrets, but we find out more about Stoker's than Veronica's, even if her biggest one came out in the last book! And she still resents her natual father's whole family for not acknowledging her in any way, but at the same time she knows that that's a really impossibility! 
 I'm still looking forward to the next book in the series!"
5,"Swear on This Life was so beautifully written. Right from the start, you are drawn into Emiline's life. It took no time at all to get into this story. 
 There were a lot of moving parts and there was a story within a story during most of the book. That might seem confusing, but it wasn't as all. Following Emiline's journey was both enjoyable and gut wrenching. I know, it's an odd combination, but if you read the book, you will understand. But I really, truly loved how complex Emiline was but how easy it was to connect with her. 
 This book was wonderful. I would have loved to have more of an epilogue, but then, I'm an epilogue lover. That's the only ""bad"" thing I have to say about this book. 
 I was given a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. To read more reviews like this one, check out Obsessive Book Nerd!"
5,I love the book more than the movie
5,"I don't know why I put off reading CoHo's books for so long. I just couldn't put it down!! 
 This book mixes all of the great things about YA and music. Hoover surprised me with her writing! It was so quirky and fluid, I can feel the characters vibrate on my mind. 
 And the music part.. just heaven. It's a talent for an author to write a book with music, it's another talent to actually make the music. Kudos to Collen + Peter. 
 I adore it so much. Hands down to another one of my fave authors!! 
 999999 STARS FOR OUR MAYBE SOMEDAY"
4,"I might be the only person in the world that liked the first half of this book more than the second. 
 I'm gonna let this sit for a while. Maybe I'll review, maybe I won't"
4,"(view spoiler)[ I was so excited to finally get this story. I was kinda bummed that we didn't get more about ozzie though. Most of the book he was his happy-go-lucky self throughout the book. I was kinda looking forward to seeing his struggle to get back to his optimistic self. 
 Either way, I loved the book and was glad that Ozzie finally got his happy ending. (hide spoiler)]"
5,"After being awed and wowed by TBP, I went into The Dark Forest expecting pretty much the same. Suffice to say I was not expecting an experience even better than TBP. The Dark Forest is an impressive book in every way possible. Luo Ji is a character so well fleshed out that at times I could really feel is despair in the face of societal pressure. I felt sad for Luo Ji and what he went through in the book and the pressure placed on his shoulders. 
 There are parts of the book that gave me the chills similar to what I felt when reading about sophons and their objective in TBP. The sociological development of humans portrayed by the author is frightening at times in how realistic it feels. The book moves at a slow pace early on but picks up near the halfway mark. It's damn near unputdownable. 
 (view spoiler)[ The Battle of Darkness left me exhausted. Reading those pages was like watching a dream shatter to pieces. Like watching the hope of billions being flushed down the drain. Even the role played by Zhang Beihai and what he did at the end on the Natural Selection was just so sad and desperate. I wonder what he would have done if he knew about The Dark Forest; would he still have plotted a course outside the solar system? (hide spoiler)] 
 Finally, I can't wait anymore for book 3!"
2,"** spoiler alert ** 
 I read this because I was excited to see a Teenage Vampire Book in which the female half of the romantic pair has fangs. Block certainly goes in a different direction than most of the books in this genre--Pretty Dead is darker, and a whole lot sexier. But it's still not particularly good. There's nothing empowering or even all that interesting about Vampire Charlotte; she became a vampire at the teeth of a controlling douche who still rules a great deal of her thoughts, and she became rich by seducing an older guy and then waiting for him to die. (I'd make a cheap Anna Nicole Smith joke, but I guess that'd be tacky now. Rats.) And while Block can certainly spin some sensual prose, it feels meaningless to me. Careless. Just as this book's characters are careless: it's like reading Daisy Buchanan, Vampyre. (Stop with the Vamp Darcy idiocies, publishers, and have a go at that!) For example: toward the end of the book, a bunch of people die in an explosion that Charlotte has a chance to stop, but she--and the reader?--apparently isn't required to care because the main characters get their happy ending. Yeah. Guess what? I no longer care about you, dead girl."
5,"Oh my days I love this book so very much!! I had it ages ago and I'v re read this like at least 3 times but just not given a review! It's one of my all time favourites and always will be I imagine! Jamie you are a genius! :) travis is awesome!!

4,"I probably shouldn't be writing a review just after i've finished it. I'm an emotional wreck. 
 Feed is a zombie book about politics. If that makes any sort of sense. The zombies were always in the back of your mind, and they were very threatening; but the main plot was focused on the politics, and the new president. Of course there are many scary, zombie scenes, but even then the story is focusing on politics. 
 I loved how the world now revolves around bloggers. The news has lied to them, so the world has turned to bloggers, because that's where the truth will come from. After The End, sounded like an amazing blog. The team had great chemistry, and the dialogue was brilliant. 
 My favourite part of the novel had to be the relationship between Shaun and Georgia Mason. Adopted brother and sister, but joined at the hip. They cared for each other, and just loved each other so much. (view spoiler)[ I feel like the only reason Georgia's death hit me so hard was because Shaun was left alone. (hide spoiler)] They couldn't sleep without being near the other. They couldn't leave the house alone. They grew up together, and even a second apart seemed to mess with them. 
 This book features a large mystery element, despite the fact that it was very easy to guess 'who did it'. 
 Overall, this book was brilliant and unique, and i cannot wait to get my hand on the rest of the trilogy. I don't really know where it could go, but i can't wait for it to take me there. 
 Rise up. 
 (view spoiler)[ Georgia's death destroyed me. I did not expect that to happen at all. I guess i should've seen it coming as they always talk about how 'shaun will be the first to go'. Her letter at the end as incredibly difficult to read, once she started losing her mind, i wanted to turn away, but i had to keep reading. Her death will literally stay with me for such a long time. Buffy's will also, my heart broke for poor Buffy when she passed. (hide spoiler)]"
5,"This book was phenomenal. It certainly is not a memoir; Kim does take a personal narrative approach but her life and her experiences are not at the forefront. She took a huge risk going undercover, and her reporting on the next generation of North Korean leaders is fascinating."
5,"""Unwind"" is one of the best books I have ever read. Hands down. The concept is so brilliant yet utterly terrifying. Why? because this book portrays issues in society that are so close to home, such as abortion, organ donations, and religion. Shusterman's futuristic world in ""Unwind"" is so realistic because in many senses it is the world we live in today. 
 The book itself was amazing. At the start I extremely skeptical. Usually, I'm not a fan of stories where the narration changes from person to person as it slows the pace of the book. However, this story was done in such a way that the story benefited from the narration and I understood Shusterman's world and characters more profoundly. 
 The characters are so believable and real it feels like I have known them for years. I loved the way Shusterman created three distinct characters: Conner, Risa and Lev, yet they all had a different story to be told in their own unique way. 
 This book made me cry alot, and not many books make me cry.(view spoiler)[ When Cy-fi was driven to his unwinds home and begged not to be unwound to his parents. When we discover that the Colonels son is Humphrey Dunfee and he has dedicated his life to put him back together again and right his wrongdoings. However, I think the most horrific scene is when we witness Roland being ""unwound"". Cleverly, Shusterman uses a character who is unlikable and has even been the ""enemy"" throughout the book. However, as the unwinding unfolds the injustice of it touches out hearts and makes us think that we wouldn't want this done to our worst enemy. (hide spoiler)] 
 The ending to this book was also brilliant and very suitable. It wasn't exactly a happy ending, however, it gave the audience hope, which is the main theme throughout this book. 
 Overall I would recommend everyone to read this book. And it is definitely worthy of 5 stars."
4,"This is the third installment in this series and I love that it was just as great as the others in the series. Sabina is trying to save her sister (Maisie) in this book from her grandmother. One of the greatest parts of this book was where it was set. The plot moved away from Cali and NY and moved on to New Orleans, which of course means there's going to be some hoodoo involved. Adam and Giguhl were back in this book to help Sabina, but each had their own idea of what the true mission is which causes some conflict between the characters. 
 I have to say I was a little surprised with the ending of this book and I am really curious where the author is going to go with the story from this point. But if it's as good as this book was, than I won't have any problems with the new plot."
5,"A book this long probably deserves an equally proportionally long review. Unfortunately, I can only emphasize how much I loved it so many times in one review. 
 Of all of Sanderson's books, Way of Kings has go to be the ultimate showcase for his world-building skills. The world of Roshar is incredibly expansive and I'm sure the first book barely acknowledged all that is going on in it. Just looking at the maps included in the book, it is obvious how much effort has been put into creating it. 
 The culture of Roshar, Alethkar in particular, is very well defined. From women keeping their ""safehands"" (their left hand) covered to clear cut gender roles to cities constructed around the existence of the dangerous highstorms that rage every few days. Glimpses are shown into the lives and cultures in other areas of Roshar but they were not major to this book, although it is beyond a doubt that they will come into play in the future. 
 The gender roles in this book went way beyond what one thinks of when you think of traditional gender roles. It did not go into ""women have to be mothers/homemakers while men rule the world."" Women are homemakers and mothers but they are also scholars and engineers. Men are not allowed to learn to read or write unless they are part of the Ardentia (the church, essentially) so fields of logic, mathematics, philosophy, sciences, etc are largely women's world. It didn't really go into what all men can do apart from waging war and being physicians. 
 A lot of attention is actually given to the covering of women's left hand. It is really tempting to think it is simply something included to add to the culture of the country but it is mentioned so often that I have 
 to wonder if it is part of something bigger although I have no clue in what way. 
 Being a nearly 1000 page book, it does move slowly at times, but that's because the scope of the story is huge and needs time to progress naturally. As mentioned, the this is a expansive, unique world unlike any I've seen so far in other fantasy novels so it takes time to set it up and to set up the characters. Despite this, not a scene feels wasted, nothing is filler. The interludes are a little jarring because they move away from the main three characters into other very minor ones. They still have in important function in the story though in showing the reader other parts of Roshar that Dalinar/Kaladin/Shallan's stories do not explore. 
 Sanderson also has an in depth discussion via his characters regarding gods and religion. A main character, Jasnah, is an atheist. Because of this, many more religious characters question her a lot about her beliefs so there are several conversations in the book about the role that religion plays in morality. Discussions like these are always fascinating to me and Sanderson manages to have them without it being propaganda one way or the other. 
 I think that I kind of have a thing for watching a character inspire other not only to follow them into dangerous situations but to simply be better people. It was one thing that I really liked about Tavi in the Codex Alera series and it's something that I love about Kaladin in this series. That said, Kaladin is a much more complex character. He goes through numerous episodes of self-doubt and having to force himself to do the ""right"" thing even though experience has taught him that it will just bite him in the end. 
 I read this book for the first time a few years ago so this was my second time through it. I have to say that I actually enjoyed it more and got into the story a lot more this time around. I think this is because there is just simply so much going on and I did not take the time to understand it all the first time around. Now that I have, a lot more make sense. Listening to it on audiobook helped a lot with that. 
 There is a lot that I have questions and theories about and wish that I could help Mr. Sanderson in his writing of the third book so that once we are done reading through Words of Radiance, book 3 will be waiting for me. It is absolutely one of those books that you can really get invested in and there is a bit of a shock in coming back to the real world. 
 Definitely a favorite."
4,"***** 4 Stars ***** 
 Cannot be read as a standalone. 
 I really enjoyed this story. As Dino is finishing up his sentence, Karen is living a normal life as a single parent. Her life is stable and good. She has a job that makes her happy and a son that brings her joy. But when Dino finally gets out, the problems from before come back harder. 
 I loved the touching moments about Dino and his son. They truly warmed my heart. But Dino needs to think of a solution if he wants to be with his family. 
 Dino and Karen try to make it work, but things are always going against them. Throughout the story, you'll see bits and pieces from The Chicago War series. Reading that series isn't required for this duet, but you might enjoy it more because a lot of the other characters are mentioned. You'll also probably have an idea on how Dino solves his problems."
1,"Nope. 
 I mentally debated giving this book two stars because there was some pretty good writing, but in the end, I just can't do it. Every time I remember reading this book, all I feel is some sort of unpleasant, annoyed sensation inside. 
 First and foremost, Girl Through Glass turns out wildly different from what the description indicates. This can be totally fine - great, even! - as long as the actual narrative is an improvement upon what you expected. This one was not. 
 In the 1970s is Mira, a young girl who's set on a track to become an amazing ballerina. In the present, there's Kate, a professor who has an affair with a student. 
 Both of their lives spiral out of control. Both of them lack pretty much any interest whatsoever. 
 I think it's pretty obvious from the beginning (view spoiler)[Mira and Kate are the same character, even if we don't know why she changed her name. I'm just putting this under a spoiler in case someone doesn't pick up on it and doesn't want the rest of this dull read spoiled for them. (hide spoiler)] 
 The thing that really gets me with this book is that it could have been interesting. It could've had an engrossing plot that made you want to learn how the story unfolded. Instead, the whole thing just felt dated, musty, and disjointed. 
 When I say disjointed, it's easy to see from the writing what I mean. Scenes frequently remain unfinished, and while that raises a million questions, the way the answers are handled isn't satisfying. 
 Mira takes forever to get into her dance school, and once she does, you see little of her there, so this really isn't a ballet book, either. It's just a book that uses aspects of ballet for plot points. 
 Really, this is a book about a creepy relationship between a girl and an old man, as well as an inappropriate teacher-student affair. There's a lot of emotional distress, but never anything concrete or any enticing character traits that give you reason to truly care about what's happening. 
 I finished this book, hoping with each new page things would improve stylistically and I would actually start to feel invested in some part of this story. Alas, it wasn't meant to be; in place of piqued curiosity, I just got irritation, boredom, and disgust. 
 This is not the worst book I've ever read - not even close (I can name what the worst one was, and I hope it's rotting away, mysteriously falling off library shelves into trash cans, never to appear again). Even so, it felt like it was trying too hard to make clever narrative choices but always falling short. Where there should've been development, there was none. Where there should've been the possibility of emotional ties to the reader, there pretty much was none. 
 Girl Through Glass is a demotivating read that I cannot recommend, simply because I feel I wasted precious hours of my life trying to like its uneven and uninspiring style and plot."
4,Another hit for this series! Gimme more!
4,"I have been sick lately and I often find myself re-reading old favourites when I feel like this. This week has been like that. 
 It is always true that you must read the books as they offer so much more incite, it is like watching the super-extended edition of the movie. 
 I enjoy this series, I even bought this book in French so I could practice the language."
2,"I was addicted to this book, but the rest of the books quickly stemmed that addiction. What a perfect world Ms Marr has created! So imaginative! So facsinating! So wickedly lovely! But unfortunately I found the main characters- Aislinn and her love interest Seth- boring. For although Keenan is a bit of a prick, I found myself rooting for him, because at least he was interesting. Add a ridiculously predictable love triangle, which you guess the result of from day one, but which doesn't get resolved till the end of the series, and you have yourself a large slice of bitter disappointment."
2,"Formulaic. Dude has some sex and fights some monsters. Girl tells everyone that she's very frightened, but nonetheless doesn't approve of hurting people. Dude fights some more monsters and eventually gets the girl. 
 I had a lot of trouble finishing this."
4,"Cassandra Clare's books are really hit or miss with a lot of people, but I really enjoy them. Clockwork Angel is no exception. 
 From the very first page, Clare throws you into the action and gets readers to bond with the characters. There's a distinct personality for each of them. Besides Tessa, they all start off somewhat one-dimensional and slowly build into someone quite interesting as more of their story is revealed. It was really great to see the early days of Shadowhunter families seen in The Mortal Instruments. I found the Victorian version of the Lightwood family to be the most amusing! 
 As for Will and Jem, I wasn't as attached to either of them as some fans seem to be. Will's snark is fantastic and I love the mystery built up around his origin, but I take a somewhat Sophie-esque approach to him where I find him somewhat frustrating. Jem is tragic and kind, but I can't wait to see him become more than that. I really hope there isn't too much of a full-blown love triangle in future books, though I'm sure there will be at least hints of it."
3,"This was a solid book. It was a necessary transitional book that made me want to scream and tear out my hair at the end because NOTHING WAS RESOLVED. 
 We follow book two Unwholly relatively closely in this book. As usual, Shusterman does a great job juggling the different perspectives of all the characters. It transitions the story well without any unnaturalness. 
 This books was basically trying to converge all the storylines. Connor and Cam meet. We reunite with Risa and Sonia. New characters relevant to the story are introduced. Starkley is emerging as a potentially big bad underling. Eh, and I guess Lev kinda gets his own storyline again. 
 But at the end, NOTHING HAPPENED. It's like I was waiting for action or a climax and all I got was the revelation that this world has 3D printers. Yay. 
 Okay, yeah, stuff happened. But it was a character development, really. (Which I am a fan of, yes, but balanced with action! C'mon!) Bah. 
 The ending made me narrow my eyes a little. Okayyyy. Interesting way to take the book to introduce a real life and current technology: 3D printers. I'm not sure if it's a plus or minus yet because it seems a little too easy. It just irks me a little bit because this is supposed to be a ""what-if"", dystopian world that has traveled in a different direction. It's clearly sci-fi because even though it boasts ""science"" with the unwinding, the retaining of memories from different body parts is scientifically debunked already. So I'm just a little startled to see a fictional world collide with our current and real world. I will withhold judgement about this strange collide until the next book though. 
 I am unwholly displeased that I have to wait for the next book for some lovely action. 
 A solid 3 stars. Definitely better than the second book, but not as great as the first. Looking forward to the next one in this series. 
 Recommended for those reading the series. Don't start here."
5,Yep I'm reading a zombie book and it is fantastic so far.
1,"Originally Posted on Confessions of an Opinionated Book Geek 
 I don't read a lot of mystery thrillers, but there was a lot of hype surrounding this book. People said it was a faster-paced Gone Girl. One of my biggest complaints about Gone Girl was that it was too slow in the beginning, and the characters were both unlikable and boring. Since this was said to be faster-paced I thought I would enjoy this more and gave it a shot. I was wrong. 
 Right off the bat I didn't like the main character, Rachel. She's an alcoholic who's obsessed with her ex-husband and his new wife and baby. She takes the train every day to pretend she still goes to work to save face from her roommate. One day, she sees something while on the train involving a couple she always observes during her ride. The next day, the woman of the couple goes missing, and things devolve from there. Rachel is an extremely unreliable narrator, and I suppose not knowing if you can really trust Rachel's observations is supposed to add to the suspense of the novel, but I was just annoyed by how pathetic she was. 
 Megan, the woman who's missing, also has a POV in the story. Her narrative is told in the days before she goes missing. As you can guess, I also didn't like her. She seems to be genuinely happy in her marriage, but also has problems with insomnia and anxiety. Her husband, Scott, recommends she goes to a therapist, and she develops an attraction for him that she acts on. Megan was whiny, a cheater, and kinda childish. She has no job, and no real skills. Her last job was managing an art gallery before it closed. Then she briefly babysat for Anna and Tom, Rachel's ex and his former mistress-now-wife. She hints at some dark secret she has, and when the secret was revealed I liked her even less. 
 And finally, Anna also has her own narrative. Anna was probably the one I disliked the most. She hates Rachel for always coming around the house and harassing her family, and she hates that she still lives in Rachel's old house. Yeah, Rachel really should stay away, but Anna isn't a saint. She was the homewrecker, and she didn't even feel bad about it. She liked being the mistress. She's shallow, vain, and boring. The only good quality about her was her love and devotion to her baby. 
 This book is not fast-paced. Far from it, actually. It was only in the last 100 pages where things really got going. The first two thirds basically consists of the three women complaining about their lives. Considering I didn't like any of them, I found it tedious and boring. There are a few red herrings thrown in here and there, but a few of them didn't make much sense and a little while in I guessed who the criminal was. I kept reading just to see what would happen to the criminal, and I was disappointed by the ending. It's definitely not as bad as Gone Girl's ending, but it's still pretty lackluster. 
 Like I said, I don't read a lot of mystery thrillers. However, one of my favorite trilogies is The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. The reason why I like that trilogy so much is because I love Lisbeth Salander. It goes to show that I should just stay away from this trend of books filled with only unlikable characters. I just can't enjoy a book if I don't like at least one character. Many of you guys would probably enjoy this, but this wasn't my cup of tea. 
 I recommend this for fans of Gone Girl, Gillian Flynn's other novels, mystery thrillers, psychological thrillers, and for people who love to hate characters."
3,"4.5 stars rounded down. 
 I liked this book and it had some really good points to it. For fan's of the series it is a must. I just didn't love this book. There were a few things that annoyed me and it stopped me from giving it five stars. But that doesn't mean everyone will dislike the book, it just means that, for me, it was not the greatest book ever. 
 Owen and Nick started out well and you could easily tell they wanted each other. Owen, a virgin was very shy. He hated his stutter and his missing arm. Nick had no issues with that because of his sister, who also was missing an arm. I loved the way they started and it warmed my heart to see Owen finally realise his bitch of a mother was not right about him. (view spoiler)[She was emotionally abusive to him. (hide spoiler)] 
 It all went downhill for me after their first encounter.(view spoiler)[Nick's positive and didn't tell Owen until after. (hide spoiler)] The term he used to describe how he ended up that way annoys me 70% of the time. Unless in a joking manner I hate that phrase. Added to that Owen being a virgin and that bombshell, it annoyed me and I don't really know why. 
 The way Owen's father dealt with his mother was good and the revelation (view spoiler)[that he might be gay too and had a relationship with a man (hide spoiler)] made me laugh, I will admit that. Although, I would have liked a bigger ending for Owen's mother. She was a right bitch and I wanted to see her embarrassed and for Owen and his dad to get their own back. 
 Overall I can say I liked the book. I just wish it hadn't gotten to me with some of the plot holes. I did enjoy it, but the theme for me was not fitting to the characters. 
 A must read for fans of the series."

5,"5+ stars 
 Wow, okay I have so many feels I don't even know where to start! Because well, ""There ain't nobody in the world like book people."" And What could be more beautiful than a novel about characters who loves books, bookstores and has a book review at beginning of each chapter? This is diffidently one of my all time favorites. A.J Firky pretty much wrote this review for me when he said : 
 "" Every word the right one and exactly where it should be. That's basically the highest compliment I can give.."" 
 Rereading thoughts : 
 Still as good as I remembered."
5,"Personal rating: 4.5 
 Absolutely loved it!"
5,"Wow! 
 What a story! 
 William Kamkwamba is amazing! Here's a boy who was a dropout form school, who at the age of 14 with little education and no money, saw a picture in a textbook of a windmill and set out to build one. And did just that. This young man, at such a young age has completely changed life in his African village in Malawi and is a total inspiration to me. 
 This book had a good story behind it, but was also written in such a way that I couldn't stop reading. Engaging, heartwarming, even heartBREAKING at times, I had to stay through until I finished. I'm glad I did. 
 Read this if you're looking for a totally inspiring story. I highly recommend it. :)"
5,2012: I listened to the audiobook of this. Enjoyed the story just as much listening to it. The narrator did an excellent job with the story and the accents.
4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 Sentence: I sentence Jeyn Roberts to a long, unhollow life, feeling the ocean (but still creating chilling scenarios like in this novel). 
 Review: There was something about this book, from start to finish, that filled in my void for a good read. It was short, sweet, dark and horrifying. I absolutely loved Roberts' style. As always, with changing perspectives, I found I had favourites. I was always itching to read about Mason, Aries and ""Nothing"", which strongly hints at being Daniel's perspective. 
 The worldwide chaos, but not really knowing what is happening is also appealing. I mean, hello, earthquake and then people freak out and start psychotically killing other people; there really isn't time to consider China, or India or Australia. It stays local and close to heart (local being North America), because this isn't exactly post-apocalyptic. It's more like whatever is going to destroy civilization (such as evil filling in the hollow parts of people's souls/brains) is ongoing. It's not a fast one-day process. And it's a game. 
 I appreciate that the author avoided explaining (to death) what is happening to the majority of people. Mason is at risk of the dark inside him and Daniel is more than on the edge of it all (and we do get a brief look into it), but it is terrifying because for some people this glimpse of darkness is familiar. It's not evil, really, as Daniel is aware. Some people have become blind with rage, hate and the violence; almost zombie-like in nature, but not dead. Others retain full-functioning and are as clever as they were before the change, but have let animalistic instincts and the dark take over their actions. 
 It's almost a cautionary tale of human nature and that with all that lightness we bring to the world, there's always the potential to do awful things. There are examples of it in our society today, with murderers, the war-hungry, and even in our ability to turn a blind eye to those that need help. But it should be clear that the potential is in all of us. 
 From her witty language (""My name is Aries, but I'm a Gemini."") to her dark prose (""We forget how truly fragile we are. Skin. We do so much to it. Burn it. Tattoo it. Rub chemicals into its surface. Sometimes we scrape it, pierce it, poke holes through its softness. Skin holds us together. It keeps the blood inside. Without it, we die. When the knife slashed through her skin, she gave a look to suggest she couldn't believe I'd hurt her. ...She thought she'd live forever.""); Jeyn Roberts has got this riveting horror-thing down. 
 Afterall, there is nothing worse than being scared of yourself."
4,"You can read a spoiler-free review on my blog! :) 
 Actual rating: 3.5 stars 
 This book was one of my most anticipated releases for April. I was very excited to start reading this and truthfully, I wasn't wholly disappointed. The magic and fantasy elements in this novel were amazing. The writing was splendid, poetic even, weaving magic through my mind. Yet I still think... I don't know. That maybe it is missing something. Maybe it's just because I know this is a debut novel from a debut author... Regardless, this is a lush, fantastical story, tying together mythology and fantasy to create a gorgeous setting and decent cast of characters. 
 Possible spoilers below. Read at your own risk. 
 I cannot brag enough about the magic and the setting of this novel. It's gorgeous and Chokshi did an amazing job tying in mythology with real world (historical world?) settings. It reminded of Alice in Wonderland and the Chronicles of Narnia with like Harry Potter too. I was enthralled and loved every minute of it. 
 The few things I did have problems with were the characters. I felt like there was a deep lack of character development and familial relationships between Maya and her family, Maya and Amar, and even Maya and Nritti. I didn't think there was enough to make me feel anything for the characters. The moment I did was the moment Maya was whisked away to another place. This time with Amar. 
 I appreciated Maya's quick thinking but her naivety irked me. How could she so easily believe Nritti? I understand that she struggled to love Amar and I even appreciated her pull to Amar since he was a means for her to escape her fate with her father. I was also able to better understand their connection once the story progressed and the readers learn they are connected on deeper level. 
 I loved Kamala though! Talking animals are always fun. I wished there was more time with Maya and Gauri, I think then I would connect more with the meeting they had years later. 
 I also liked that Maya had what I would call a journey of self-discovery. She was stripped of almost everything so she had to find herself, disassociate herself with Nritti and Amar and revisit her old life though no one knew who she was. It helped shaped her as a stronger character, giving her a better belief in herself and I think, overall, the power to conquer Nritti and regain Amar. 
 It'll be interesting to see what else Chokshi writes."
4,"This is book #4 and once again contains a thrilling mystery and further development of the main characters, Russ and Clare. We, and Clare, also meet Russ's wife, Linda, who is described as a Marilyn Monroe-like curvy blonde. 
 Woven among the mysteries of the books in the series (at least so far) are current social issues. In the first, it was teen pregnancy; then gay issues were a feature of book 2; book 3 hit upon the immunization/autism controversy; this book includes both issues pertaining to the environment and globalization of business and how it may impact normal working people and our economy. 
 The book recounts the events of a single day. It opens with Clare being called out to search for a missing young woman (Clare has officially signed up for the search and rescue team after ""unofficially"" helping search for the missing doctor in book 3). 
 Clare has learned to be a bit less impulsive but she is still inclined to rush in to help regardless of the danger involved. 
 Clare and Russ openly acknowledge their feelings to each other. There is one scene reminiscent of one of my Most Romantic Movie Scenes - in Witness, where Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis stare at each other over a car in the barn. At the end of the book, Russ says he is going to be honest with Linda about his and Clare's relationship. 
 Can't wait to see what happens next in Millers Kill! 
 4 stars."

 My biggest issue is Lexi herself I don't like her nor I care for her. Lexi sounds like a 12 year old not the 17 year old that she is, her character has no depth. Lexy doesn't listen and in the midst off just losing her father she is only thinking about Jack, her feelings for him and kissing him. Everyone lies to her and instead telling these people to f#ck off, she lets them lie and lie in her face every f#cking time. Jack being nr#1 lair here. Jack was an A-hole lying and keeping secrets. 
 There was no real love building, it was instant attraction and love at first sight. 
 The plot is not so hard to figure out and I was bored. The ending was stupid."
5,This book is astounding. So far my favorite one of the series. Mason <3 ADRIAN <3 EDDIE <3 DIMITRI <3 ROSE <3
4,"Good second installment book. The middle of it becomes a bit slow paced at times but well worth it because there is a lot going on that needs to be touched on or explained. Mind blowing ending that leaves you hoping you have book number 3 on hand...That's all I'll say. 
 Def a favorite across the genres, YA, adult and otherwise."
5,"4.5 Stars 
 I have recently discovered the sweet, melt-in-your-mouth, goodness that is Tiffany King's writing, and I could kick myself for not reading her sooner. It's no secret that one of my absolute FAVORITE tropes to read is the second chance romance. I love every single aspect of it and am in absolute heaven when I get to read it. Misunderstandings offered me a huge serving of that trope, and I devoured every delectable word of it! 
 Brittni is stuck...literally. And worst of all, it's with the one person who she can't seem to forget, the person who despises her, the person who betrayed and turned his back on her, and the person who she loved more than anyone else. Brittni is stuck in an elevator with her ex, Justin, and it's the last place she wants to be. 
 Misunderstandings is the story of Brittni and Justin's journey, told in both the past and present, and reveals how they met, how they fell in love, what ultimately tore them apart, their heartbreak, their pain and their grief over losing the person they loved the most. In the beginning, their road to each other was not easy, especially since they are both young, strong-willed and lack relationship experience. However, their connection was extremely passionate, intense and refused to be denied, immersing them head first into love. Their passion for each other burned bright, but not enough to quell their fears of giving, and receiving, absolute trust in a relationship. In the end, their road still isn't easy. Only forgiveness, acceptance and understanding can pave it the rest of the way. 
 Brittni and Justin are an incredible couple who I fell hard for. Their emotions were honest, authentic, heartfelt and palpable. I hurt for them, I cheered for them, I forgave them and I loved them. Their growth, maturity and awareness, as characters, as individuals, and as a couple, were beautiful to read. 
 Even though I loved this book, there were a few negatives for me. I felt that the catalyst that led to the misunderstanding was not true to Justin's character. Even with his inexperience and immaturity, I still don't understand the choices that he made. I also wanted more time in the present for these characters. What Justin & Brittni went through had a profound effect on them as a couple, and as individuals. Even though the air has been cleared, I wanted more. Their characters needed and deserved more present page time to fully come to terms with everything they had been through. 
 Overall, Misunderstandings, and the Woodfall Girls series, is a fabulous addition to the New Adult genre, and one that any fan would fall in love with and enjoy!

0,Based on the terrible reviews I doubt I'll ever read this but.....look at that cover!!!!!
3,"It was enjoyable enough.. 
 I wouldnt classify it as a great book but nice to read when you are bored (or like me just read everything you get your hands on). 
 The main character annoyed me. She was very irrational. In a few scenes she freaks out about the threat of kidnapping that she almost faints then a few scenes later she is demanding to be a stray and live on her own. No wonder the men are so protective since she seems intent on trying to get herself killed/kidnapped. 
 She could have been tough without being reckless, but the character was just plain reckless. 
 Romance was interesting.. Her decision at the end came out of nowhere. What was the point to the entire book? *sigh*"
5,"One of the cutest stories I have ever read! After the last few books I've read, this book was a balm to my eyes and imagination. A well crafted fairy tale with sliver-twists that ties up all the loose ends into a fancy knot. 
 Sophie is the oldest daughter of three and she grew up thinking that she would have the most boring life of sensibility because that's what the oldest are meant to do. She loves her family with quiet pride and she does everything she can to make them happy. Never thinking of herself as being more than ordinary, she fails to see the magic she creates in everyday activities. After a series of events, Sophie becomes cursed by the Witch of the Waste, wanders into a Wizard's castle and becomes embroiled in an adventure of love, daring, challenges and facing fears to discover inner strength & beauty. 
 I'm so glad I read this book! Definitely one that should be read to children and reread for fun as an adult."
4,This historical fiction is based on real women who were spies during World War I. The dual narratives in World War I and II were equally interesting. It made me want to learn more about the real people who inspired the book. This was recommended on Modern Mrs. Darcy's summer reading list. I've enjoyed all of her picks so far!
2,I have to think about my review for this one since right nowI'm a bit perplexed- and irritated!
5,"So before I begin this legitimate review, I have to show this review from baby me that didn't know how to separate feelings from writing reviews: ""OH MY GOSH!!!!!!!!!!! AHHH!!!!!!! If I was someone who cursed, I would be in soooo much trouble right now, this book is so incredible. MUST READ."" I still don't entirely know how to separate those feelings, but I like to think that I'm better at it now. I also apparently didn't curse back then... hmmmmm.... anyway, here we go. >:) 
 Since first reading this book back in 2013, I have always been in love with this entire series and every book in it with no exceptions. I have to say though, that this is the first time I've reread the entire first book, and I HIGHLY recommend rereading this series, because this second time around was so much better than the first. The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer is a beautifully creepy story that will wrap itself around your mind and take root there. There is simply no getting it off your mind, so if you get freaked out easily, be warned. But really, there are so many different well-constructed elements of this book that there is probably something for near every reader. The writing is magical, the plot is definitely intriguing, and the characters are perfectly flawed and real. What makes this all the more interesting, is that it is told in first person point of view from an unreliable narrator (Mara). There are some pretty strange happenings in this book, but the catch is that the reader can never really know what is real or not because while there are paranormal aspects in the book, Mara also has PTSD which makes her question everything. This is part of the reason why I would recommend reading it at least twice, because this second time through it read as all the more ingenious after knowing what happens in books 2 and 3, while also just being thoroughly enjoyable on its own again. 
 (view spoiler)[Here comes the big review. Please note, that while I have read the other books in this series at this point in writing, I will not take their events and details into consideration when reviewing this book. There will be absolutely no spoilers for the other two books and this review will be solely on the first book alone. 
 PLOT: 
 Looking back on it, there was not too much of an actual plot in this book. There is one, but it builds on the peripheral of the book's focus, which is developing the characters and mostly just trying to figure out if Mara is completely insane or if there's more to the story. This first book is almost all character development, but there are also some miniature plots that get explored, like how Mara's friendship with Jamie grows and develops, traveling to the weird priest with the chicken blood, and then of course the murder case and finding out Jude is alive. I think I would say that those two are the main ones, because there is groundwork for them throughout the majority of the book and they both have grand resolutions (in a literary sense) at the end of the story. Overall, I think the plot of this book really only serves as a setup so that the reader is prepared for whatever lies ahead. 
 CHARACTERS: 
 Mara- Oh, Mara. I think that reading this book from Mara's point of view makes it the most unreliably narrated story that I have ever read. This does make the book all the more interesting though because then the reader's mind is always trying to figure out what is really happening too and is looking for clues in the words and always is wanting to turn the page to see what happens and if it is real or a figment of one of Mara's hallucinations. As a character, I really love how Mara is in no way ""perfect"". She is not a straight A student, she doesn't have extracurricular activities, and she talks about homework and tests. It all just made this book so much more realistic, because a lot of the time in YA books, the reader doesn't really get to see that mundane stuff. But here, it is front and center and I think that it is done brilliantly. 
 Noah- I don't even know where to begin with Noah Shaw. He is a bit arrogant, a bit sassy, and a bit entitled, but he is also entirely genuine in himself and cares astronomically about so many things. He is slightly stereotypical as the YA love interest, but he wears it so well that I don't think anyone can really count it as a fault for him. There are just so many parts of his personality and character that break my heart, like how he got angry on behalf of Mabel when Mara first found her, and then he proceeded to spend the night in the vet's office to make sure Mabel recovered. Credit also has to be given to him for sticking by Mara's side even though she is very dark and twisty. Even despite her telling him that she wants to see the criminal killed after they have the revelation about what they can do, he still believes that she is good and won't do it. Jury's still out in my opinion as to whether or not she did cause the killer's death. 
 Jamie- I love this kid. He also has his own issues, but I think for the most part it is commendable how good of a friend he is to Mara and everything that he does for her, even though they've only known each other for a few months. He does disappear from the book randomly. That is I think one of the few faults of this book. I don't know why exactly he had to leave the book like he did, but it seemed very abrupt. It did however solidify my hatred for the Evil Twins (Anna and Adrien). 
 Jude- This little bleeeeeeeeep. Feel free to fill that bleep in with any curse word of your choosing. I hate this character. Not in a way that I think that character was poorly written, but in a way that I hate the personality of this character and who they are. It is so awful, that I don't even want to dwell on it, and I don't think I need to either. I will add though that on top of everything else that he did, I hate Jude even more because at the end of the book with the reveal that he is still alive, there is also the revelation that he has been stalking and messing with Mara. 
 The Dyer Family- I really enjoyed how there was a family portrayal in this book. There's the mom, the dad, and the two brothers. There is literally a WHOLE family in this book, and they each get a fairly decent chunk of page time too. It really was done so well, that when Joseph was taken, the reader can't help but feel anxious along with Mara in more of a sense than just, ""Oh, this is her little brother."" No, it is in the sense of, ""What! This adorable child that watches the news and is networking has been taken?!!?"" The family dynamic and development in this book I think really adds to this story and makes it seem so much more rounded than if it didn't. 
 WRITING: 
 The biggest thing I can say about the writing, is that Mara is the most unreliable narrator ever. And I am very aware that I have pointed this out already. But looking at the actual writing, it is executed in such a good way where the reader cannot pick up on what is real or not based on the phrasing that Hodkin uses. It all flows together seamlessly, so no one, reader or Mara, can have a leg up as to if what is happening is real. Stepping away from this creepy factor, I also think that there are some really great funny lines in this book. The sass is original and well matched by the characters and put perfectly in their contexts. 
 (hide spoiler)] 
 One of the things that I love about this series is that it is framed by this cryptic opening letter that sets up not just this book, but the whole series, as a sort of confession. This letter, when I first read it, made everything all the more creepy. And then I found the backstory to the book, which made it all the more creepier, but also all the more amazing. The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer is one of my absolute favorite books that I have ever read and I cannot express fully the enjoyment that can be gotten from reading this book and this series. If you still have reservations about reading this book, I'll just finish with two words: Noah. Shaw. 
 Thanks for reading!"
3,What? I liked my boarding schools when i was 13 lmao
5,"5 stars! Yup there is no doubt that I AM ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE with this series!!! I stayed up late reading until I couldn't and woke up early just to finish Destined for Doon. 
 Those last few chapters definitely made me happy dance, fist pump, cry, swoon, laugh... then that ending. I'm so glad the series is complete and I have all of them because after that last scene, I would be so wrecked and in so much pain if I had to wait for the 3rd book. If I the first book left me wanting more, this one left me needing more... More of Vee and Kenna's friendship, more of Jamie and Duncan, more romance, more magic, more mystery, more adventure... more of Doon."
4,"This book is like Sorcery & Cecelia: or The Enchanted Chocolate Pot in all the best ways. It derived humor from the mismatch of high society and the supernatural, corsets and calling cards versus shapeshifting and spells. I LOVED IT. I generally love that stuff. I loved Dacia and Lou. This book is a prime example of a fantastic concept being executed even better by great characters. Of course we can always trust Jessica Day George to do this, it's basically her M.O. her World building is amazing to begin with, then she places these fantastic heroines into it and magic ensues. I love that we can always trust her to put lots of rich historical detail into her fantastic worlds, first with the Norwegian details in Sun and Moon, Ice and Snow, and now with the Romanian details. 
 So I realized that while I was reading this I was sort of assuming that it was going to be the beginning of the series. This helped me to excuse it was a little slow on the pick up. I knew the shape-shifting was coming and I didn't understand why it took the first half of the books to lead up to it, but excused this because I assumed that this much exposition was necessary because of leading into a longer series of multiple books. Although by the end I saw it was necessary because of the change that came across India and Lou we needed to see that before in order to properly understand their development, especially concerning a bit of a role switch that happened. Having finished it I really am not sure if she is intending to write a sequel. It wrapped up rather nicely. It doesn't seem like a sequel is completely necessary, but I really want one. Or 4. I have hope because Dragon Slippers easily could have stood alone but we have three books. Books can end with nice round endings and still have more to come, it happens every day. Dear Jessica Day George, I am Lauren. I am a loyal fan. I vote for a sequel. Please please. I want more of these characters, I want more antics, and I want it all over Europe. It could stretch, there is more there. I really believe this. And I really do think this book will work even better as the beginning of a series than it does as a stand - alone."
4,"This book revolves around Gabry, the daughter of Mary, who was the protagonist in The Forest of Hands and Teeth. Unlike Mary, Gabry has always known safety inside the lighthouse shes grown up in. That's why one night outside the barriers - the only protection from the terrifying Mudo - comes with startling consequences that will forever alter Gabry's life. 
 One thing that really stood out to me about this book was the difference between Gabry and Mary. I liked how the author made it easy to tell the two apart, instead of using a consistent tone in both novels (which would have been misleading). Although Gabry was ultimately easier to sympathize with, she often reflected on the past to the point where there were paragraphs devoted to the ""what if I did this instead"" and the ""what I should have done"". The writing in this one was stronger than The Forest of Hands and Teeth but not perfect. 
 Once again, the Mudo, aka Unconsecrated, were horrifying and revolting. In The Dead-Tossed Waves the characters seemed to think more about the actual transformation - they pondered whether or not an individual should still be considered living, or dead, or somewhere in between. That provided the plot with a little something extra on top of the fear fest and love triangle. 
 While hope was not the most prevalent theme in Carrie Ryan's second novel, I am still looking forward to seeing where she takes the story from here."
5,HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO ME (again). That was so unexpected.
4,"When I received an invitation to review this book, I wasn't sure how I was going to like it. I don't read many mob-related stories, but I do like action with my romance, and the blurb was intriguing, so I thought I'd give it a try. 
 So glad I did. I finished this book late last night and it's still stuck in my head. The book worked very well for me as a standalone, and it just made me want to go read the first book in this series, RAZE. 
 221 was kidnapped as a child, imprisoned, and tortured, medically and otherwise. He's a human killing machine, obedient to his master and dangerous to anyone he comes in contact with. 
 Talia is the daughter of a crime boss and having grown up in this environment, she doesn't see the brutality of it. Much of the violence is matter-of-fact to the men and women in this story because it's so ingrained in their lives. When Talia decides she needs a break from it, she retreats to an isolated family home. 
 Talia's brother Luka still struggles with the after-effects of his incarceration and burning need to avenge those who cared for him. I really liked this character and I'm itching to go and read Raze now to learn more about his story. 
 These three lives collide and what follows is an intense and emotional romance between Talia and 221. Yes, there is some insta-love here, and there are some major reasons why Talia shouldn't fall for this guy, but I do believe in that spark that ignites when you meet ""the one"" so this worked for me. 
 The interactions between these two kept me turning the pages. 221 has quite a bit to learn after he detoxes from the drugs, and Talia slips into the role of helping him like she was meant for it. I loved these two together. The language between them was just lovely, and the line ""You are..for me."" had me choking up more than once. 
 Most of the action comes in the last part of this book, as everything crashes down on them, and 221 will have you crying and swooning when everything comes to a head. 
 And the ending... oh my, there's a great setup for more of this story that had me smiling, even though I sort of saw that coming. 
 Overall, great story, good writing, with a few slow spots for me. A little glossary at the end for the Russian words would have been much appreciated. REAP left me wanting more, and that's a great reading experience. I will absolutely be keeping an eye on this author and will be reading RAZE before the next book in this series."
5,Sigh...I had forgotten how fantastic this book is. Time spent with Diana Gabaldon is time well spent :)
2,"So it's been weird when they keep talking about English like they're not speaking it. Apparently they're not, as you find out halfway through the book. They're speaking JAPANESE and I didn't even know. What?! ""Aya trailed off in frustration with her English."" ""Frizz whispered in Japanese."" I thought the ""English"" they were talking about was proper English, without words like ""bubblehead"" and ""brain-missing"" and ""panic-making."" Huh. Anyways, this book wasn't necessary to the Uglies series and I didn't really like it. It didn't make a whole lot of sense and was just fluff."
5,"Started it this morning, finished it two minutes shy from midnight. This is the most beautiful, messy, painful book I read in a while. It really portrays such a tragic, complicated situation, where it was impossible to pick sides. I cried constantly, as early as page 30, because IT HURT so much. It hurt almost, if not more, than I'LL GIVE YOU THE SUN. It's just so...raw...so real...and I can't really put everything down in words right now, but know I adored this book and it's definitely going up on my favorites shelf. 5 stars."
3,"This might be worthy of a 3.5 stars. A standard Hunter experience for me, generally well written with some good sex scenes but just lacking sufficient heat, or story, or character interaction to take it to the next level of rating. It's frustrating because, as I've said before, I think she has the basic chops to write something special but it just doesn't get there and in some ways she's a victim of that when it comes to my grading . Probably how teachers feel when gifted kids just phone in their work to get a B grade when they're capable of more. 
 This is the only one of the Blooms series I've read so the whole 'house for women in hiding where they also grow flowers' was a bit lost on me, if I'm honest, as were the relationships between the previous heroines. 
 Daphne, the heroine was good. She needed a bit more characterisation, a bit more motivation exposition. Hunter wants the mystery about her background and particularly the bombshell dropped at the very end. Sometimes though, the desire to prolong the mystery undersells the character to the reader, a reality many romance writers would do well to remember in a genre that (for me) works best when trying to develop the relationship between two people with whom the reader develops an affinity. But by and large, I liked her and I wanted her to get her HEA. 
 Castleford was better for me. Again, in some ways underdeveloped but much more is revealed about him and so he felt more rounded. I like that he's a typical duke - arrogant, rude and rakish. 
 Their romance develops in fits and starts. It's too based on desire for my liking. When the declarations of love came at the end, I was asking myself - but why? Which is never good in a romance novel. There's not sufficient banter between the two of them and the moments which could have been seminal and utilised to power the romance were rushed. 
 The story generally is a bit all over the shop, and the pacing is off. Peterloo was shoehorned in and the Duke as a government man seemed to come out of nowhere (perhaps it's dealt with in the earlier books). And the villain was so utterly villainous, moustache twirling - the whole nine yards. 
 I sound very down on this. I did read it all the way through. I didn't skim and it passed the time more than adequately. It won't be my last Hunter because I'm hoping, one day soon, she writes the book I'm sure she can write."
5,"Alright folks, it's confession time: I have never watched Buffy. 
 *Waits for jeers to die down.* 
 *Deftly catches rotten stone fruit and returns it with an accompanying curse.* 
 *Snatches geek credentials back from the mob and loops lanyard around neck, thankful for the breakaway safety clasp.* 
 Ahem. 
 So, turns out that James Marsters's natural voice is not the one he uses for Harry Dresden. Who knew? To say that hearing him lose his groove after a break is a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT would be an understatement. 
 What's that? Oh, the book itself? 
 Fucking kickass, what did you expect. 
 You don't get to reading the 14th book in a series and decide it's not your cup of whiskey anymore. 
 Nothing else can make me smile so hard at epicly awesome scenes (or send serious shivers down my spine). You thought you know Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden, but now he's back and he's a motherfucking badass. 
 (Never fear though, he doesn't stray into the uninteresting spectrum of hyper-competent protagonists. Most chapters still end with ""oh, crap"" and Harry gets his ass handed to him more often than not.) 
 In many ways, this is a set up novel for the new story arc. Seeing everyone again, getting used to his new position, exploring his new domain, etc, etc. Harry's got a few trust issues this time around, but he's finding his way and settling in. 
 One last thing: if you didn't get it from the title, Cold Days is heavy on the Winter Court and the realm of Faerie, and as a result it features...wait for it...Santa Claus in a sword fight. 
 I kid you not. Kris Kringle himself, in the most entertaining display of Father Christmas I've ever seen. 
 If that didn't sell the book for you right there, well, I'm not sure we can be friends any longer. Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out. 
 This is an impressively fun book--go forth, read it, and be merry."
4,I'm honestly just going to buy this instead of having to go to the library and borrow it every time I want to read it.
0,Definitely not my favourite of him. Read just once.
3,"Meh 
 I feel a little underwhelmed with this story. It wasn't that it was bad or anything but generally the whole fallen angel thing isn't really my typical subgenre of choice. 
 That being said the story is good enough that I probably will continue to read it. 
 This book was picked for me in a group challenge this month because I think this book was suggested to me in the past and I wasn't all that interested just because I am not a huge fan of the cover. 
 Not bad just a very niche genre I think."
4,"This review can also be found at Carole's Random Life. 
 This has been an amazing trilogy. This is a set of books that I am certain I will read again at some point which is pretty high praise from me. I always try to write spoiler free reviews but this review may have some spoilers for the earlier books in the series because I simply don't know how to avoid that. Honestly, if you haven't read the prior books in this series you will want to stop read my review at this point and start reading Steelheart instead because it is really that good. This was my least favorite book in the trilogy but it was still an incredibly solid ending to the story. 
 At the start of this book, things aren't looking to great for David and the rest of the Reckoners. The events that ended the previous book have left them at a bit of a disadvantage. Prof is gone as is Tia which leaves David in charge of the group. David is trying and he has a plan that he hopes can save Prof and change everything. The need a few gadgets and during the groups quest to get their hands on a few they meet Knighthawk who ends up being a wonderful addition to the group. 
 The group that I have grown to know and love are all featured in this book. David and Megan's romance was adorable. David's use of metaphors is still something to behold and Megan has learned a lot about controlling her power. Abraham may have been my favorite in this book. He has always been a bit mysterious but I felt like we really got to know him a little bit in this book. Cody didn't have the same charm for me in this book that he had in the first book in the series. His stories that were fun at the beginning of the series have started to grow a bit stale for me at this point. Mizzy added humor at the right moments in the book but I actually think that Knighthawk's sense of humor was the most enjoyable. 
 This book has a lot of action and the setting was very interesting. I am still trying to envision a city made of salt in constant change. It sounds odd but it actually worked for me. There was a lot of planning and coming up with ideas in this book for the Reckoners. There was action but most of it seemed to be crammed into the last part of the book. I would have liked to see a little more action spread out in the story. The story took a few twists that I predicted and a few that I didn't. All in all, I found it to be a nice ending to the series but not quite as good as I had hoped it would be. 
 I would highly recommend this series to anyone looking for something a little different. If the idea of a world where individuals with powers are not the heroes but the villains sounds even remotely interesting, I would suggest that you give Steelheart a try. I have enjoyed everything that I have read by Brandon Sanderson up to this point but I still have some catching up to do. I plan to read a lot more Sanderson in the future. 
 Initial Thoughts 
 I enjoyed this one. I thought that this was a nice ending to the trilogy. I am feeling pretty satisfied by how everything actually ended. I loved David, Megan, Mizzy, Abraham, and Cody just as much in this book as in the previous installments. The city of salt was incredibly interesting. Highly entertaining! 
 Before reading 
 How awesome is it that I woke up to this ebook checked out to me and ready to read from my local library?!?! I love my library!!!"
1,"The ending seemed contrived, like Roth just wanted to end it the way she did to be 'edgy.' The love story and bickering became unbearable and the story lost its focus. Definitely the worst of the series."
3,"The twist at the end of this book reminded me too much of the ending of The Polar Express, and I was a little bit disappointed that Van Allsburg expected the same idea to have the same impact twice. It makes me even sadder to realize this book came first, so the gimmick he uses wasn't even new in The Polar Express! I also wasn't as impressed by the illustrations as I expected. I wonder if I have grown too familiar with Van Allsburg's style over the years to feel awed anymore."
3,"The plot and adventure is interesting, albeit implausible. However, the romance is so cheesy and really really annoys me to hell. I am glad the film is much better in the romance aspect (as in non-existent) than the book."
3,"Eh... Stepbrother= I don't effing know. It was okay, but I just didn't fall deeply madly in love with it. First of all, it was so hard to relate to the characters and parts were sweet while others were just odd... I don't know not my favorite."
4,"Sarah really knows how to make endings! 
 The ending = 4 stars 
 The rest of the book, I don't know... 
 (view spoiler)[ so far every book has been the same. Training. Weird creature. Creature defeated. Oh look cute guy. (hide spoiler)] these books are enjoyable."
2,"At best this book was fine, at worst it was not terrible. 
 I love 'Scarlet,' but it's sequels just do not live up to the original premise for me. And though I love romance, this book is more mushy than sexy. blergh."
3,"I'd give this an exact 3.5 stars. I'd give it a 4 but it wouldn't be fair. 
 First of all, I was intrigued by the concept of this novel and wanted to see how this concept got executed. In which I did, of course. I almost gave up on this one, let me tell you. I almost did. But I didn't... And I'm glad. 
 The first half of this novel was unbearable. I'm not kidding. The first half basically annoyed me out of my guts. This part I'm telling you about is the part where I wanted to give up on this book. The concept of having banned love and then associating it with God is an idea that really doesn't agree with what I've been taught all throughout my upbringing and current adolescence. That is why the first half of this novel got on my nerves. It started demonstrating a world that 'hated' on love and it was unfathomable to me. My opinions on love being the very adhesive that holds humanity together is as unshakable as my faith in the belief that God is love and love is real. You get the idea. I just can't describe how much I detested the first half of this novel. 
 I'd have to admit that Lena Haloway had her Bella Swan moments as well. 
 The second half of this book impressed me. It made up for what the the first half lacked. I can't pinpoint what the first half didn't have but I guess I could try. Lena was kind of ignorant and fearful at the first half but here at the second half of this novel, we see someone bursting of courage. We see someone who'd break barriers for her loved ones. We see a butterfly encased in a jar who is now eager to break free from its restraints. I guess I gave Lena a chance since she was brought up in naivety... And that made it all worthwhile. I loved the part nearing the end and the climax. Kind of a cliffhanger but it's alright. I can't wait to read Pandemonium. 
 Needless to say, I wasn't completely gutted as I was impressed. But I guess, I've got a fair share of both."

 OMG - I don't know how to start this review. That's a lie, I know what I want to say first. First of all, THANK YOU SO MUCH JESSI @ NOVEL HEARTBEAT! Jessi had this ARC, loved it, and wanted to share it with others. She set up this unofficial ARC tour with a handful of other book bloggers - and I had a blast participating! This was my first ARC EVER (hey - I just started blogging in December!) and I loved it so much. I honestly hadn't heard much about this book before signing up for the tour - I hadn't heard of Kristen Simmons or her Article 5 series. After hearing Jessi's love for this book, I was definitely intrigued! I also read The Handmaiden's Tale in high school and I remember enjoying it. 
 I Loved It! 
 Ok - now about the actual book. It's going to be hard for me to talk about this book without spoilers, so lots of spoiler tags here! And I'm going to gush a lot a little bit. I loved the story AND the characters (OMG - love Aya and her spunkiness so much!). Aya, the MC, was such a fighter and never let anything keep her down. She was constantly making me laugh (literally LOLing in real life!). (view spoiler)[ I also loved Brax, Aya's adopted wolf puppy, so much! I have my own gray puppy, Meeko - although she's only 7 lbs - but Brax reminded me of her! Especially when Kristen describes Brax's coloring as a ""flash of silver"". (hide spoiler)]I also loved the male MC - let me marry him please! (shh - don't tell my fiance!). [spoiler] When Kiran spurns Aya, I was so heartbroken! But I knew deep down there had to be a reason for him to treat her that way! . On top of being strong spirited and spunky, Aya has a strong love for her family - she would do anything for them - and I really connected with that and admired her for it. I love a good book with a strong female character that I can admire. 
 So Many Surprises! 
 I have to say - this book was just one unexpected turn of events after another! AND I LOVED IT. Nothing went the way I expected, and it was very well done (and I feel I'm fairly good at picking up on plot twists). Even when something unexpected happened, it wasn't so crazy that it seemed to come out of left field - it was believable (I hate crazy-don't-make-sense book twists - book pet peeve!). I even felt like I should have seen the dramatic ending coming because its something that has happened in at least a few other YA books (it seems to be a thing now!) but I DIDN'T see it coming and I still loved it, even if it wasn't completely new. See this spoiler for the less vague version - but only if you really want to know! :) (view spoiler)[Aya and Kiran are on the run and give up on getting away. Instead, they stage Aya's death so that the people that are after them will give up and go home. (hide spoiler)] 
 In Summary 
 OMG I LOVED THIS BOOK. And it makes me sad it's a standalone. I haven't talked about Kristen's writing in this review yet, but I loved her writing style so much! This book never got on my nerves (that's always a plus, right??) and I loved the characters - they each had unique personalities and voices! Kristen's writing drew me in (and hooked me!) from the very beginning and didn't let me go until I finished the book. I honestly can't recommend this book enough! Especially if you like dystopian YA books. Keep and eye out for this one - it comes out February 10th! 
 Favorite Quotes 
 As part of this special ARC tour, each of us bloggers picked out our favorite quotes! Click this spoiler tag to read mine. Emphasis is my own. :) (view spoiler)[ 
 pg. 233 - ""And I feel it happen - silent and soft as a feather, a piece of my soul becomes his."" - What a beautiful way to describe falling in love! 
 pg. 275 - "" 'It's not the first time someone's called me names.' I do my best to hold my chin up. 'I'm not crying about it. I just though you were different.' "" - I love this quote because it is the epitome of Aya. She is so spunky and a fighter! 
 pg. 316 - ""And it's right then that I figure out the truth: Part of my soul might belong to Kiran, but part of his belongs to me, too."" - This goes with the first one. :) Again, a beautiful way to describe falling in love. 
 pg. 316 - ""With Kiran, I am the barest version of myself, not protected by my walls, not hidden behind the Garden's makeup and dresses. I am fierce and pretty and my value is not recorded by some body book or measure by stars on an auction block."" - This is such a great feminist-plus-love quote. I love that Aya sees through the constructs of her world and knows her value as a person. She can really be herself with Kiran because he sees her true self too. (hide spoiler)]"
3,"This is a very nice little novel about a group of friends who meet at a creative arts summer camp, and their lives over the next forty-plus years. Over the course of the novel, we see their reactions to historical events such as Watergate, the AIDs virus, 9/11, and the economic crash. It's all very New Yorkerly, if I may coin a phrase, but while I liked the book just fine, it failed to wow me."
3,"Breakin' it down: 
 - Plot: 3 
 - Emotional wreckage: 4 
 - Last few reveals' ramifications for overarching series story: 2 
 ...thus, 3 stars for this one. 
 ONWARD TO BOOK FIVE. (Binge-reading is not the best for my health, but I've yet to find a support group that suits my needs.)"
2,"it was a struggle to read this book. 
 first, because of the format and quality of the ARC (not comfortable to read in any of my devices); 
 second, because there were a lot of new terms threw at you as you were familiar with the food the mermaids eat or the ways they live under the water; 
 third, because of the many ways the life of the mermaids didn't make sense for me (knowing too much about humans and animals, for example, or drinking tea or sweating under the water, huh?); 
 and fourth, because even if the author made a great effort to build this world, she got lost sometimes in descriptions and it took more than half of the book to get to the point. the main character spends a lot of time undecided and hesitating about everything (and she's supposed to be the leader of the clique), her cousin whines all the time and the only one that seems like the beginning of an interesting character is ling. toward the end we are introduced to the other three mermaids of the prophecy, but everything is rushed as if the author had a limit for the page count and was using it up without getting to the point. 
 i didn't have great expectations about this book, but the story develops in a too juvenile way for my taste... 
 since this arc was in a very early stage i hope the book got a good makeover. it has potential, but right now i'm not interested in reading this saga. 
 thank you to netgalley and disney for providing me with a copy of this book."
5,"I love the story of Beauty and the Beast. It was my long-standing favorite Disney film for forever. I think I like it mostly because I can relate to Beauty. Her love of books, hope of true romantic love, and down to earth-ness on many aspects of life. Anyhow, someone recommended Robin McKinley's rendition of Beauty and the Beast to me after I read her book, Sunshine. It took me a while to get a hold of the book (I was waiting on a trade from swaptree.com), and then I just had many things on my to be read list that I just wanted to get to first...so it took me a while to get it. Reading Beauty on the skirt-tails of reading The Thirteenth Tale was perfect, because the authors have a very similar style. There are a lot of details in the writing style. It was a good combination for me. 
 I was captivated with this story from the start. Again, I think it was mostly because I knew the story, I knew what happened and was really excited to see it unfold. But then again, thinking about to reading Sunshine, I was captivated by that story too. It took me a long time to get into it, but once I was I cared about the characters and was excited for what happened. I think Robin McKinley must have a very unique writing style that does that. I cannot pinpoint exactly what it is that is so great. Maybe in some small way it IS all the details in her books that eventually slam into each other to make this wonderful story. Her books don't have a lot of action. Well, Sunshine did closer to the end, but still yet, I found the book moved very slow. Her books are also not overly romantic. In fact, in both books I've read of hers, Robin McKinley has left me wanting - wanting MUCH MUCH more. More so with Sunshine than Beauty. 
 As a reader, I do like details, I like full stories with a wonderful happily ever after, I really like romance. I love perfect couples. Beauty did offer most of that to me. It wasn't until after the book was done and read that I thought, ""but what about...?"" There were so many things that just didn't get explained in my opinion. Things like, what DID Beast eat anyway, that probably really aren't important details in the story, but ended up being important to me. I also wanted more love, more of a connection between the two. I'm afraid that Beast proposing every night to Beauty felt more like desperation than love. It felt like he just wanted to break the curse and move on rather than he was truly in love with her. But, on the other than, there was the scene where Beauty faints and Beast carries her. His tenderness at this, and her shock when she wakes up in his arms, was beautiful - and the most expressed love that I saw from Beast, outside of granting her a week with her family. 
 So I loved the book, and at the same time it was ""eh, just okay"" too. It's weird to have two different opinions, and makes it even more difficult to write about it. It did get me thinking that I'd like to read a book from the Beast's perspective, since most every rendition is from Beauty's. A quick search on booksamillion.com brought me to Beastly by Alex Flinn. I've never read anything by Alex, and am not sure how this will measure up to the usual story, but I'm sticking this on my TBR list and hoping for the best!"
4,"This was really fun! I loved going into the past and of course the future for some of my favourite characters. The short story format was really fun, there were some I enjoyed more than others but as an average they were 4/5 stars!"
3,"This is a cute summer read. It's a little bit long, in the way of overwrought teen books with angsty heroines (this one, Samantha, is relatively tame in cimparison). The story is a classic before and after story, with the before dragging on a bit too long, and the after rendered without a thoughtful enough examination of the events' effect on the characters, but overall I liked the plot, the characters, and the simplicity of the story."
3,"Faerie caught my attention when I first read Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell and continued to dazzle when I read Stardust. Since then, any book with fey folk has intrigued me. So even though this Wicked Lovely looked a little too teen romance for me, I kept picking it up to reconsider. 
 Aislinn has always been able to see faeries, but they've usually paid her no attention. Her grandmother has taught her to be terrified and avoid them at all costs. So when two faeries begin following her after school, she is more than a little worried. Turns out, her concern is not unfounded. The faeries have plans for Aislinn and her life will never be the same again. 
 As it turns out, parts of the book were a little too teen romance for me, but other parts kept me interested enough. I really liked the character Donia, and she turns out to be more important in the end than it seems like she will be, so that made me happy. I'm also genuinely curious to find out what happens in the world after the end of this book. I didn't care a lick for what would happen with the romance, but what will happen next to the power structure in faerie is pretty interesting, and it seems to be the topic of the next book Ink Exchange, so I might pick it up in the future after all."
4,"Eve Dallas and her team are at it again. Murder in New York and Eve is on the scene, quite literally in this case, as the murder takes place at a dinner party at which she and Roarke are guests. This all happens in the context of a feature film (or vid, as they call it in the Eve Dallas future) about the Icove case Eve recently solved (from the Origins in Death book.) Much is made of how very, very much the actors and actresses all look like their real-life counterparts, from Eve to Roark to Peabody, McNab, you name it. This isn't quite believable unless those people had plastic surgery, because as we all know actors may resemble their characters on screen, courtesy of makeup and costume, but in real life ... not so much. So that part of it, and the multiple reactions based thereon, is a bit overdone. It's refreshing, however, that Roarke doesn't own the building the murder takes place in (although he does own a restaurant at the end, never fear.) This is a pretty standard Eve Dallas book, written with J.D.Robb's (aka Nora Roberts) fine writing and attention to detail. These are usually not great nail-biters, but they're always fun and it's always nice to visit Eve and the gang."
3,"2.5 stars. It was fine. Reading about the lives of the three (plus three half) main characters held my interest for the most part, though recurring themes of jealousy, discontent, and the changes brought about by progressive stages of life got to feel a little forced and repetitive. If you had asked me after Chapter 2 to guess what was going to become of all the characters, I wouldn't have made too many wrong guesses. The lives that all these people lead are so different from any life I ever had or ever will have that I had a little trouble really relating to them, even though I think one of the (the primary?) messages of the whole book was supposed to be ""all people are interesting if you just think about it from the right perspective."" 
 Eh. By now anyone who reads my reviews probably knows that I simply prefer my fiction a little more out there. A little more... fictional. If you enjoy a tale of complex people living complex lives in a very real world, this would be an excellent pick for you. I'm going to go find a book with wizards, now."
5,"It is odd to be reading this one amid the later Amelia Peabodys (Peabodies?) but gosh is this one good! The cast is perfect, the mystery is sharp, and outside of The Falcon at the Portal there's not another Peters book with as believable strong emotion. 
 I'm feeling the need to read them all again, maybe in chronological-to-the-Emersons order, or maybe in published order so I can be startled at how a genre author developed her style...or just at random as I have been since I really ought to know the story arc anyway by now."
4,"I liked the first half a bit more than the second half. The story took a different turn than I thought it would, and it kind of threw me off. I didn't dislike where it went, but I was taken aback by it. I couldn't connect well with the characters that were introduced in the second half, but I hope I will be able to in the sequel. Even though the second half wasn't as strong in my opinion, the last couple chapters were really strong. I would recommend this to fantasy lovers and newbies alike. The plot was intriguing, and the characters were complex. There was just something missing for me to give this book five stars. Overall, a really solid read that I wished I could have finished sooner if it weren't for my busy schedule!"
2,"This book was so terrible that I almost had a hard time believing it was written by Christie herself. I might change my rating to one star later, but usually I only do that for books that were both downright infuriating and a gross waste of my reading time; and only the latter applies to this book. 
 In the Big Four, Poirot is spread out too thin, and there's an awful lot of telling and not showing. We are told that the Big Four are an international group of baddies who want to take over the world, or something. Ok, but how? Why are they so threatening? What have they accomplished globally, so far? Why are we never shown or even told about what fresh hell have they wreaked upon the world, or which global superpower has fallen under their influence? 
 This book wants to be way thicker than this, a super cool and elaborate tale of international intrigue and power struggles a la Game of Thrones, with a dash of James Bond thrown in. But it's just a disjointed little whatever with Poirot casually solving some mysteries that we don't spend enough time with to even care about. And as if it wasn't enough, Poirot's solution was all too easy to see through in the end. I wasn't fooled for a second. 
 There's also some casual racism thrown in, with the frequent use of the word ""Chinaman"". 
 So yeah, I've been reading the Poirot books in order of publication, completely blind to blurbs and reviews, because I just want to read them all in order until I reach the Orient Express. But maybe I'll keep an eye out now, for the ones I should avoid wasting my time on, LIKE THIS ONE."
3,"I feel like I've read this book already,, more than once"
4,"The only thing I didn't like about this book was the ending, too open ended I felt for this genre of writing. Easy read, characters to like and hate, a bit predictable in some parts, but over all a good summer read."
4,"The mysteries are back! So glad to see Anita back with the police. This was a thrilling story, loved the plot, and it's always great to see Edward and see him work with Anita to help the cops."
5,"Me at the beginning: I'm not going to cry. I already know what's going to happen. I'm good! 
 Me at the end: *UGLY CRYING* WHYYYYY? WHYYYYYYYYY??????? 
 I don't know how I will be able to read book seven <.<"
4,"Considering the well known story of Anne's fall, Mantel does an excellent job of presenting it to the reader in such a way that it is gripping. The sheer joy of reading this book comes from Mantel's use of language. There is a brillant passage early on about England and battle. Additionally, Mantal presents characters in such a way that they are both unknown and known to the read at the same time."
4,"Let me preface this review with the fact that I really like Alissa Johnson. I like her writing stye and she has a way of fleshing out characters so that they become very real. Sometimes I find she tends to have the heroes all tortured or conflicted and has the heroine""saving"" him, which is a bit annoying- the other way around is good, too! 
 In this story, the first in a trilogy, our hero Gideon is traumatised by what happened on the ship under his command during the war. Meanwhile, our heroine Winifred (Freddie) struggles to make ends meet on an isolated, run-down farm in Scotland. She lives with her former governess and has learned to farm, grow her own food and generally make do. So when Gideon arrives, ready to hand over some money that had been owed by his family to Freddie but stolen by his wild and irresponsible mother, she is in heaven. Gideon worries about the two women and ends up staying longer than he intended, (he wanted to pay up and get out) and love takes its natural course. 
 Except it is not that simple, and Johnson ably describes the struggles and fears that both protagonists face when contemplating their relationship. I guess in the end I got a bit annoyed that Freddie had to do so much of the running while Gideon wrestled with his (misplaced) guilt. I like my heroes to work a bit harder to win the girl, but maybe I am just the mean, unforgiving type!! 
 Despite this, I thoroughly enjoyed the story and the MCs were truly lovely people who deserved their HEA."
4,"This is a clever story about an assistant in love with his boss, who treats him poorly. The only thing I did not like was the numerous juvenile, scatological references."
4,The story and the illustrations are stunning!
5,"This review was originally posted on Cocktails and Books. 
 This book was reviewed by a member of the review staff at Cocktails and Books. The name of the reviewer can be found under the post categories."
4,"This was a very good story. I was kind of sick of dystopian, so when this one came around, I didn't know what to expect. And I'm so glad I read it!! 
 Kitty is one badass character, right from the get-go. She doesn't need t be *told* to do something (such as hide when Shields come to the door) and she refuses to be left behind. 
 However, I didn't like Benjy as much. By the end of the story, I got a bit tired of reading Benjy's name, because it happened so often. This was probably so we would remember him, as we only got a glimpse of him in the very beginning, but still. Also, I feel like he could have been more fleshed out. And he needed saving so often. I like that Kitty didn't need saving very much, but by the end of the story I was waiting for Benjy to get a spine. Knox, on the other hand, I really did like. 
 I'll admit, a few of the twists I saw coming but there were more than one, so plenty of times I was surprised. And the ending... I was left with just enough closure to feel satisfied, and just enough loose ends where I want to continue the series."
3,"2.5 stars 
 The story was interesting and fast paced but the language took a little while for me to get used to. This definitely is a book targeted at the younger end of YA and it just didn't draw me in as much as it could have. Enjoyable, but I don't think I'll want to read the rest of the series."
4,"I discussed in an earlier blog post the sudden proliferation of amnesiac protagonists currently littering the landscape of YA novels. Another Little Piece features such a protagonist. When Annaliese Rose Gordon is found, she is miles from home with no memory of who she is, how she got there and where she has been in the year she has been missing. 
 What follows is a journey: a real time construction of an identity, a tense realization of the incongruity between the physical self and the entity that resides in the physical shell. Anna, as the person inside Annaliese calls herself, is an other, not in the postcolonial sense but in a ""not-human"" context. There is a deal that bound Annaliese and Anna together and the completion of that deal is what leads Anna to be inside Annaliese in a very Stephen King-esque way. 
 The book is dark, dealing with themes of love (in all of its manifestations), the desire for immortality and the matter of choice. There are poems scattered throughout the novel, poems that were written by the real Annaliese, the one who is gone and will never be again. They are poignant and heartbreaking - they offer glimpses of a girl who could have been much more if she had just given herself a chance. But she didn't and now she is gone, leaving snippets of herself in various unexpected places. 
 The romance is interesting. Though it is not the most compelling one I have read, it does offer more than just binary expressions - he loves me, he loves me not. I still think the relationship could have deepened slower but I seem to have this problem with every YA novel I read. I liked how the love interest in this novel is more than a love interest. He is a person with his own thoughts, dreams and ambitions. He has his own problems and his own ""abilities"" to deal with. 
 And that's the thing. This novel does not belong to, as Alison Waller would term it, ""fantastical realism"" (where the world is normal and the paranormal aspects affect only one person, my definition) but neither is it magical realism. It's not outright fantasy where special abilities are the norm. The paranormalcy is not explained and scattered, the powers manifesting in different people without any reason given for their origin. The twin whose sister's dead, the love interest - why do these people have these abilities? The novel does not even attempt to explain and while I have no problem accepting that they do, I would have liked some engagement with the mythology to give the narrative more substance. 
 This directly affected the denouement of the novel. I have no idea what happened and how or even why. Things worked out rather too neatly and I didn't like that. I wanted more explanation, a slower pace to give the resolution more credibility. 
 The pacing has problems but the writing doesn't. The writing has the right hooks and I had no problem immersing myself into the story. It's only when the book is done and you are thinking about it that you realize that you still have some questions that remain unanswered. 
 However, when all is said and done, this novel entertained me. A lot. It is a strong debut and makes me look forward to what Ms. Quinn comes up with next. Recommended."
4,"For anyone who lives in The Jewel, it means a life of wealth, luxury, royalty. For girls like Violet, it means a life of servitude away from her family. She was born in The Marsh, the poorest district, and taken from her family to be trained and one day sold to a family in The Jewel to be their surrogate. It doesn't take her long to see the truth behind the wealthy facade, polite and proper in public and planning downfalls in private. Now the surrogate for the Duchess of the Lake, Violet finds herself falling for the boy hired to be the companion for the Duchess's niece. If their relationship is discovered, the consequences would be devastating. 
 This was a book I've had on my anticipated reads list for a while and I was happy that it didn't disappoint. The plot and world-building was really interesting and disturbing, the pacing moved well so I never felt like it was dragging, and I really enjoyed the main character. 
 Violet was my favourite part of the book. She could have easily decided to throw herself a pity party at what has become her life and I would have completely understood. Instead she found ways to deal and survive. She was smart and caring but could also be impulsive and rebellious, which showed in her actions. The secondary characters were good as well, and some of them I wish we'd gotten to see more of. Violet's friend Raven who was sold to another house, The Duchess's son Garnet, Violet's maid Annabelle, a stylist Lucien, the companion Ash, all characters who added something to the story. Even the 'evil' characters like The Duchess showed that they weren't one dimensional and that they had their own stories that could be revealed. 
 The concept was easy to understand and the world-building was vivid enough to get a clear picture with the different areas(The Marsh, The Smoke, The Farm, The Bank, The Jewel). The descriptions of life for these girls were appropriately horrifying and the more that was revealed, the more disturbing it got. 
 The romance was sweet but it did feel a bit fast. In some ways it was understandable that Violet and Ash would latch on to each other given their situations but he was introduced late in the book and soon after, they were in love. I could believe them as a couple but maybe if the romance had gotten a little more development, I would have felt stronger about them. 
 It was easy to fly through this book. It seemed like I'd just started it and then I was done(and wanting the next one). There were some things that were predictable but others that did surprise me. There did feel like there was a lot of set-up done in this book, which hopefully means more action in the next ones. 
 Lastly, the cover is absolutely gorgeous and I can't wait until a physical copy of the book is released so I can see it in all its hardcover glory. 
 *I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."
3,"This book followed the formula for the other books. Nothing groundbreaking and no surprises. It was a good way to pass time and to catch up with the New Species guys. 
 story 3 
 narrator 3"
3,"I find many of Lovecraft's other stories to be far more scary than this one. I think ""Mountains"" lost me because of the scientific jargon within it, and the intense descriptions of architecture (which I always find to be boring in fiction). The idea in this short story was scary enough - I found that once the narrator got to the mythos of the old city, the plot picked up and went faster. The descent into the city was great also. But Lovecraft's genius works better in SHORT short stories - this one was simply too long. 
 I read Loveraft's essay on ""Supernatural Horror in Literature"" as well. I think Lovecraft is far too picky a critic for horror literature, but I suppose all good critics have to be that way. His descriptions of certain stories have definitely inspired me to look them up. Yet I think he gives far too much credit to Blackwood, Hawthorne, and Bierce (whom I can't STAND). 
 All in all, not Lovecraft's best, but decent."
5,"** spoiler alert ** 
 Oh my God! This book was awesome! The minute I read the last page I jumped up and ran to my laptop to look up when the next book comes out. Not until 2011, nooooooo! I'm already dying to read it! 
 Well, this book was recommended to me by my GR friend, Shannon. She was hesitant, because our tastes don't always align, but I'm glad she bit the bullet and rec'ed it anyway. I read Storm Born first, so I wouldn't be lost reading this one, and while I did enjoy it, I also didn't think it was that great. I was nervous about reading this one, but it surpassed all of my expectations! 
 The beginning was a little slow for me. A lot of time was devoted to Kiyo and their relationship. I've disliked him since the first book, so I was less than thrilled to have to read so much about him. Also, all their relationship consists of is them having sex. With so much page time devoted to their relationship it translates into a lot of page time devoted to them having sex. Their sex wasn't particularly interesting either. 
 I'm not against aggressive, animalistic sex, but Kiyo took it pretty far. When your partner implies they find your orgasm-giving skills lacking and wants more foreplay you should probably pay attention. I couldn't believe that Eugenie had to stop him and cuff him to make sure she got off first! Poor girl. No wonder she almost jumped out of her skin when Dorian grabbed her arm in the beginning. She's probably dying for someone to dominate her and work her over. 
 I loved getting more information about Eugenie's kingdom. As someone who lives near Tucson I was shocked when she morphed her land into it. I thought she must have been high, but whatever works for her... I'm glad she got confronted with the real issues of how her choice affected her people. They have to relearn how to grow crops and find water and they need to figure out how to get some A/C in there. I'm glad the stuff like that wasn't skimmed over. 
 Dorian impressed me a lot in this book. I found him interesting in the first one, but also kind of flat. This one really helped add depth for me. He seems more like a ruler who actually cares than a bored royal. I loved the speech he gave Eugenie about being protecting her people or admitting to them that she couldn't. He showed real passion and intensity there. As much as he likes to don his bored royal mask, he is dead serious about what it means to be a king or queen. 
 I was really glad that Dorian moved on after Eugenie dumped him in the last book. I know him sleeping with other people will piss some readers off, but I loved it. I don't want to see him pine from his kingdom, waiting for her to finally decide she's going to dump Kiyo and come to him. She dumped him and was sleeping with someone else, it would have been dumb for him to wait around. Although we did get a nice hint of his pining for her in his own unique way. 
 Dorian endeared himself to me forever with one sword stroke at the end. I was so glad that someone did that, damn the consequences. I couldn't believe Kiyo laid that pile of crap on Eugenie to get her to back down. Way to make the victim feel like shit about herself! Thank goodness Dorian was there. 
 Kiyo bothered me throughout this whole book. His booty call tendency toward Eugenie was really distasteful. I also can't believe he knew all the problems her kingdom was having and didn't mention it to her. Why is he so down on her magic and queenship anyway? He had no problem sleeping with his baby's mama. Why is it only bad when Eugenie does it? I also can't believe that Kiyo didn't have the decency to send Eugenie a message during (or even after) the birth happened. He seems to have no consideration for anyone other than himself. 
 I outright hated him when he talked Eugenie down from having her revenge. That's not the thing you think about when you find out about that situation. He should have been cheering her on or asking if he could do it for her. Then, he had the balls to try to get her to apologize??? What the hell is wrong with him? I'm so glad things turned out that way. I really hope he won't be a major part of the series anymore. 
 I love Dorian to death now, but his world domination excitement at the end made me nervous for their future. I can't wait to get the next book! 
 Thanks for the rec Shannon!"

4,"Awesome illustrations and a great story; I really enjoyed this one! Both funny and though provocing, Bryan Lee O'Malley does a good job of asking big questions within a relatable world and with characters I enjoyed meeting. I have only read a few of his Scott Pilgrim comics and this made me want to go and read them all."
4,This book was a lot of fun to read. It was completely different to what I was expecting and it was very enjoyable. Can't wait to see how the rest of the series goes.
4,"Aside from most of the moody, petty high school and what I consider to be typical small town drama, I ended up enjoying Beautiful Creatures much more than I anticipated. Some of it is rather cheesy (geared towards a younger audience) while the rest of it is funny and intriguing. I look forward to the rest of the series and am intrigued with the possibilities the movie might bring. 
 For anyone who has read any of my other reviews - this book falls squarely into that annoying category of ""first books that are not complete stories."" I'm finding it more and more rare that a book is as good standalone as it is as the larger part of a story arc."
2,This was great!
5,"There was no doubt in my mind that I would enjoy reading this after the highly intimate love affair I shared with Daughter of Smoke and Bone. Laini Taylor has been blessed with an otherworldly mind. It's her breathtaking ability to make writing an art - she's not just telling a story, she's creating a masterpiece. She can turn the most mundane of words into something rare and precious. It's not just her prose that I have come to adore, but also her imagination. I don't think I've quite read anything like the mythology she weaves into her stories. From Smoke and Bone to the awe-inspiring Hatchling, I am blown away by the depth and sheer creativity 
 Three stories. Three different meanings behind three kinds of kisses. Three times your heart will fall in love, despair and conflict. 
 Goblin Fruit: Kizzy has spent her entire life watching from the sidelines, yearning for something more to fill her. It's the power of wanting so bad that the consequences don't matter anymore. Would you give into the temptation of something you have ached for your entire life, just for that one moment of utter joy and happiness, even if meant your death? This was the shortest of all, but perhaps the one with the most humour, as each story grows progressively more darker. Oh, don't despair. There is plenty of dark here among the soul-snatching goblins and the lure of forbidden fruit, but the interactions between Kizzy and her friends had me laughing many times! 
 Spicy Little Curses Such as These: Oh, how I would have loved to see this turned into a novel-length story. Laini executed it perfectly, but I wanted more. I was so taken by Estella's story and the weighted decisions she must make on a daily basis - all while sipping tea with a sadistic demon in the pits of Hell. She was forced to place a curse on Anamique when she was just a baby. If the girl murmurs a sound, it will kill anyone in the near vicinity. But while her voice may curse those around her, the silence has cursed her own life as she's grown into womanhood. Forcing her to withdraw into herself, hide in the shadows while those around her mock and jeer the 'dumb mute'. Until. A young soldier finds her diary and discovers the beautiful, intelligent girl hiding within and so begins a romance that will capture your heart in it's honesty, it's sweetness. And it's tragedy. This is a story of first loves and the lengths you'll go to save those loves. And it's a story of consequence. For every action, there is a reaction, a give and a take. 
 Hatchling: This one stole my breath away. This is the longest and by far, the most richly explored and darkest of all three stories. The mythology is nothing short of amazing. The world of the Druj and what poor, helplessly human Mab endured as a small child at the hands of the Queen were shocking and brutal. Your heart has no choice but to reach out to the victims of this cruel and downright creepy world. We witness Mab's heartbreaking story and how she escaped their clutches with a baby in tow. We journey along with her daughter, Esme, who's changing in terrifying ways and may be snatched back to the horrific world her mother has so longed for her to never witness. And we delve into the fascinating and scary history of the Druj, where Laini decides to twist everything you thought you felt and craft such an emotionally complicated story. She makes you feel an understanding for the 'villains' and - perhaps - a twinge of sympathy for their own plight. Just... WOW. Nothing is ever as it seems when it comes to this author, she keeps adding layer upon layer and then digs 20ft underground to find more hidden layers to shock you with. 
 Running through each story is a fragile thread of hope. Hope of being someone else, having something more. Hope of emerging from the shadows and showing your true potential to the world. Hope of protecting those you love from the horrors you faced yourself. Hope of finding your humanity. 
 Laini Taylor and Jim Bartolo. Author and Illustrator. Wife and husband. The ultimate dream team. The accompanying art by Jim for each story is absolutely beautiful. The art doesn't spoil the story, rather tempts and captivates your mind and doesn't fully make sense until you've finished reading. Her words, his art - they make for a truly magical use of ink and paper that demands a special place in your bookshelf. 
 Lips Touch transports you to a magical world where live goblins and temptation, love and curses, demons and stolen children and the scary power of longing for something you're not fully aware of."

5,"I won an ARC of this book from the author! (THANK YOU!) 
 The first book made me want to tear my hair out in frustration and punch certain characters in the face. (All punching would've been done lovingly) 
 The second book did indeed rip my heart to shreds and scream a bit more. (THE ENDING THOUGH) 
 The third book made me shout HALLELUJAH! 
 It was EVERYTHING I NEEDED AND WANTED. 
 This is the book where we get into the nitty-gritty political details and learn what Ryaih's and Darren's world looks like. And, as a bonus to us readers, Ry and Darren are actually together. Yes they fight and have to separate for a chapter or two, but finally FINALLY, they're a thing and Darren is too darn cute. 
 And it's time for the Candidacy!!! The big tournament to choose the next top mages and naturally Ry and Darren both want to be the Black Mage. That's as far as I'll go into that, but know it was.....yeah, stuff happened. Boy did stuff happen. Cause and effect, people. Cause. And. Effect. 
 Now, I don't want to give anything away, so just know it was amazing. 
 A little quote for you before I go......how about meeting the parents? 
 ""Mom, Dad, this is Darren."" I couldn't help but notice how stiff and quiet our audience had suddenly become. 
 My father was first to break the silence. Unfortunately for me it was in the most embarrassing way possible. ""Well, well, 'tall, dark, and handsome.' I can see why my daughter picked you. She certainly has a type."" 
 Alex guffawed, and even Derrick had to hide a grin as the prince's face shot up in flames. Not even Darren was prepared for my father. 
 Happy Reading!!!"
3,"It was okay. The story was interesting but I had issues with character development, and the romance bits. Just seemed a little off to me. But the plot was interesting. The book also leaves a lot of loose ends dangling at the end. Not sure I will read the next one."
3,Review removed because in 2011 I was terrible at reviewing and there were spoilers. Better review hopefully coming soon.
3,"If I need to explain the basic plot of Twilight to you, then you're seriously behind in pop-culture--which is a lot coming from me--and you should go find a copy right now and read it. I was in middle school when The Twilight Saga became so popular, and all I knew was that everyone had this book. At this time in my life, I read occasionally, but not because it was my favorite thing ever (a lot has changed, yeah?). Anyway, this is the fourth time I've read this book, and it brought on a bought of nostalgia. I watched the movie a few weeks ago for the billionth time, and had the sudden need to reread the book (I had forgotten how much they had butchered the movie in comparison, but that's just my opinion). Needless to say, I remember why twelve-year-old me loved this book so much. 
 So I'm sure by now you're wondering: if she loved it so much, why did she only give it three stars? Excellent question! First off, this book had a lot of grammatical mistakes (I'm cringing as I write that sentence) that I hadn't paid close attention to before. Secondly, Edward can be overbearing and manipulative. I read in an article that Fifty Shades of Grey was originally fan fiction of Twilight. Now, I've never read Fifty Shades--nor will I ever (not my thing)--but I have discussed the book with some people who have. Apparently, Edward, just like Christian Grey, fits most categories of abuse. As I write this, I know there are some people who won't agree, but I was blatantly reminded why I chose Team Jacob. 
 I won't go any further into that, and instead will talk about the surface of Twilight. Always and forever, my favorite couple will be Alice and Jasper. No matter what anyone thinks about this book, they will not change the fact that I adore both of them. Rosalie and Emmett, two more of the Cullen clan, were also great supporting characters. This time reading through the novel, I understand Rosalie more than I ever had before. Basically, Rosalie hates Bella because she was jealous of the human life Bella had. I completely understood where she was coming from! Bella might have been one of the most dependent female heroines I've ever read. She couldn't focus on the life she had, the friends she could've made, and the boy she should have fallen in love with (Team Jacob forever), because she had an obsession with Edward. However, Bella taught women everywhere something important: you don't have to be strong all the time; it's okay to be weak. Forever, that lesson will resonate with me. 
 Twilight will always hold a special place on my shelf--it kind of has to, since I have multiple copies of almost every book. Preteen me will always be grateful of Meyer for giving me the story that made me curious about the worlds beyond the one I was living in. No matter how many bad things people have said about The Twilight Saga, I honestly believe that every reader should read it at least once--it's like a rite of passage. Isn't it normal to categorize our selves based on Team Jacob or Team Edward? 
 Stephenie Meyer, I will hope for your name to hit shelves again one day, until my dying breath. Twilight might be forever, you guys."
5,"The second book was soooo much better than the first! OMG. 
 Basically, I'm now team Warner forever and that's all you need to know. 
 No but seriously, this book was AWESOME! There were so many cool stuff happening everywhere and people with their superpowers and just GAAH! (And Warner, Warner, Warner - yes, I've read the novella) 
 I get what everyone has been raving about! 
 I had a small problem with some characters Juliette being WAY to indecisive and sometimes too emo but they're teenagers, I get it, we're annoying as hell sometimes."
0,DNF. A week and 20% in to this book and I have no idea what's going on. It isn't holding my interest and I feel like I've already wasted a week on it when I could have been reading something else. Such a shame because I loved the previous book in the series.
5,"With this book, I finally understand what the big deal with Sherry Thomas is. His at Night is an unusual romance and one that I had a horrible time putting down to function in the real world. It features a truly evil villian and a hero and heroine that are intricately created so that they become absolutely real to the reader. The hero was especially unusual and intriguing. I haven't laughed quite so much in a long time as he plays the part of a complete imbecil. However, the longer I spent with him, the sadder I became as I slowly started to identify the variety of ways that he had shortchanged himself and his family in order to play this part. I was rather proud of the heroine when she finally started to realize his duplicity. Also, I was vastly impressed by the psychological depths that we explore with the abused heroine as she comes to recognize the negative affects caused by her own life of pretending. This was an amazing read all around and I am excited to read more by this author (despite my negative experience with her other novel Delicious). Also, it is nice to come across stand-alone novels in the romance genre."
4,"Well, I just finished this in the dark at 3 in the morning. I am a bit scared and weirded out and still thinking about the book that will probably stay with me for a long time. This was such a rollercoaster ride of reading. Every time you think you know how the story is unfolding, who the 'bad guy' is, and then it flips over. This is one creepy scary ride and I really will not spoil anything. I just urge you to read it if you are in for a breathless eerily creepy story. You will not want to put this one down so prepare to read if you have time to finish it."
4,"HIM was one of my favorites of 2015, so of course I loved this one."
3,"""Don't Bury the Headline"" is what I remember the motto of this book to be. 
 This book is about how to make ideas ""stick"", or how to recognize ""sticky"" ideas. It gives some useful tips on how to make your ideas stand out and how to make sure people remember them, however some five months after reading it I hardly recall any pieces of advice from the book, so it didn't really stick with me."
3,Mixed thoughts on this one.
4,"The book was a great read. I liked how she dresses and didn't care what others said. However, her relationship with her boyfriend in the middle seemed not the right guy for her (of course they broke up). ,I wish the story could have been like her not having a boyfriend, but still holding a grudge against him. Maybe that's my imagination. I really liked the book, and how it turned out to be. It was a good read for me."
3,"This review appears on Happy Indulgence! Check it out for more reviews. 
 Upon opening Falling Kingdoms, you'll be greeted by a map of the Mytica and a list of the cast of characters, split up into four kingdoms. This implies that you'll find a deeply constructed and rich fantasy world that is so complex, you need to refer back to these beginning pages. 
 But in actuality, Falling Kingdoms is as simplistic as a fantasy could be. While it has all the elements of a fantasy world - armies, corruption, Kings, elemental magic and even war - none of it was explored too deeply, with the world hazily described at best. While the book attempts to set out the opulent world of Auranos, contrasted against the poor starving nation of Paelsia, and the frozen kingdom of Limeros, you'll struggle to truly picture the tensions between the Kingdoms in the story - other than the simplistic view of power and war. 
 The same treatment is given to the many characters, who were bland and one-dimensional. From Magnus, the dark Prince who's in love with his sister, to Cleo, the spoiled and privileged princess with a sharp tongue, and Jonas, the boring rebel who wants to kill for vengeance, these characters played their parts perfectly and predictably. There's also a host of other point of views, some which are seemingly pointless. 
 Although there are similarities to Game of Thrones, everything is watered down for the YA audience - with hardly any spice, pizazz or satisfactory bloodshed in the book - which I'm conditioned to, being an avid fantasy reader. There are deaths, but I felt absolutely nothing when these occurred, due to the lack of emotional connection to the characters. 
 That's not to say Falling Kingdoms wasn't entertaining - it's a quick addictive read despite it's length. Because there isn't much depth with the world or the characters, it feels like a fluffy soap opera, which is actually kind of refreshing in the fantasy setting. Will Magnus act on his feelings for his sister? Will Cleo end up with her guard? Will Jonas get more interesting? The story delivers on the drama and I couldn't stop reading. 
 Magnus's romantic feelings for his sister were pretty disgusting, and I struggled through his story for the most part. While his deep seated feelings got worse before they got better, thankfully they were one-sided. Not sure how I would have dealt otherwise... 
 While Falling Kingdoms isn't the deepest fantasy out there, with one-dimensional characters, a lack of emotional depth and a weakly constructed world, it was an addictive, fast paced read filled with soap opera-like drama. It's suitable for readers who are just getting into fantasy, or who are looking for a light read. I can definitely see the potential, and I'll probably be continuing with the series."
1,"I can't even with this book. It was so overwritten and overwrought. I stayed up until 2 a.m. just to be done. 
 I can appreciate that the author researched the insane asylum where the novel is set, but she threw in every possible cliche when it comes to mean high schoolers and evil authority figures. 
 I'm sure I'll have a lot to say at my book club meeting (this was already on my to-read list & I voted for it, so I have no one to blame but myself), but I'll leave it at that here. Not recommended."
2,"My least favorite of the series. Way too many ""life lessons"" with preachy dialogue from almost every character. Literally nothing happened in this book until the last 50 pages."
4,I quite liked this! Definitely going check out the rest of the series.
5,"Such a surprise! 
 The first time I read the first three books, I thought the author was just winging it. Since now reading the books twice, I see that was NOT the case. There were just so many twists and turns, it made no sense to me the first time. Now, I see that I was SO wrong, happily wrong. I really think I am enjoying these books much more the second time around!"
4,"I love this series. I really do. It had a love triangle that left me unsure who to root for. And I normally can't stand love triangles. I read each one of these books in a day. 
 This book was great. I loved how the relationships evolved and changed. I love that they did so plausibly- which is hard to pull off. I loved the resolution of the love triangle. The Bachelor/Selection process was well done. At first glance you would think it would come off ridiculous, but it worked in all three books. 
 This was an easy read and just enjoyable. Great resolution to the series. I highly recommend it!"
1,"Real rating: ZERO stars 
 This book was awful. It's 511 pages could have easily been cut down to 250 tops. The 'love connection' had no explanation or evolution and Haven spent probably only 25 pages total with Lucian. Lame. Overall, Haven was extremely unlikeable; she is a sell out in order to get herself through life. She is weak, selfish, and a flat character. I had high hopes going into this book and am regretting that I ever picked it up."
4,"Danica and Zane are bonded and living their lives between the Avian Keep, and the Serpiente palace.

4,"4.5. The Texas setting was nice, and Ty and Zane are so sweet together. I can't wait to see Zane propose..."
4,"The book starts with Sunny on the run from her father. She crashed her car into a lake and is in the process of drowning until she is rescued by a handsome stranger but when she hears sirens she knows she must flee. Hoping that they meet one again if fate has a hopeful hand. 
 Now three years later she is in college, working hard to put herself through it, moved into an off-campus apartment. Things are looking up after her break up with her baseball star ex-boyfriend, who she caught with another girl. That is until she watches a drunk girl leave her neighbor's house to get in her car and crash into her car, sideswiping her door. Angered she goes over to confront him and find out info for his conquest. 
 Opening door, star QB, Max, is thrown. He has never met this girl but there is a pull that he knows her. When she threatens police action he offers a solution. They drive to school, learning the have a class together. When they learn they both have an ex in the class he comes up with the idea to act as bf/gf to ward them off, make them jealous to get even. See his ex, she did the whole ""baby trapping"" attempt. 
 What ensues is the growing closer, as line blur, we learn more about each of our heroes. For each step forward though we seem to take one back. When Max makes a huge decision without her input things are at risk for crumbling....badly. Throw in someone doing things to Sunny, a flower, a card, a text warning, a library prank went wrong and you have an interesting story. 
 Where this book lost points for me...the characters backstory was weak, I'd have liked a deeper connection to the two. Also, the secondary characters had no depth for me. Finally, the ending and the openness of the antagonist and lack of loose ends tied took a point away from a really good read. 
 Still highly recommend this book. Well done Ilsa Madden-Mills."
3,"I'd like to give this book a higher rating; it is really creative stuff and good, hard SF. But I struggled with it until about the 3/4 mark. The writing style just didn't resonate with me, and it just seemed too slow. It's not that I need non-stop action, but I'd like a little less convolution in my reading. 
 I ended up liking it more than I thought I would, because it WAS so inventive, and because it finally focused on the two main characters, Martin Springfield and Rachel Mansour. I liked these two. I wanted to know what was going on, from their point of view, more than was given by the book. There were a few annoying characters and I felt too much time was spent on some of them. 
 I will give Stross another try or two."
4,"***I received an e-galley of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review*** Thank you Little Brown! 
 This book is unlike any that I have read before. I think the story is interesting and unique. And it definitely wasn't what I was expecting. (But in a good way!) 
 The Walled City is a terrible, horrible place. There are drug lords, street gangs, brothels (with sex slaves) and a lot of poverty. Kids are living on the streets trying to survive. And young girls are getting sold into prostitution. 
 It is a very dark and gritty and violent (at times) story. 
 I think that the author did an amazing job with world building. I really felt like I could picture the Walled City. And I felt like I could picture the characters and the people that were living there. 
 I had no idea when reading this story that it is based off a real place. Kowloon Walled City which was in Hong Kong. While reading the story I kept thinking about how scary it would be for this to happen and how much I thought like it could happen. Then I got to the author's note at the end and read about Kowloon Walled City. 
 The Walled City 
 is not historical fiction, but after finding out a little bit more about Kowloon Walled City, I think that the author did a good job writing a piece of fiction of what could happen in a Walled City. 
 This story is told from three different points of view. Dai is haunted by his past. He is stuck in the Walled City running drugs for the drug lord. He is searching for what he needs to be able to escape the Walled City alive. Jin is living on the streets dressed as a boy to try and stay safe. She is doing alright, but she is on her own mission. She is searching for her sister that was taken away from her years ago. And the third point of view is Mei Yee. She is stuck in a brothel, wishing for a chance to escape and see the outside world again. 
 These are three very different people all stuck in the Walled City for one reason or another. And all three of the characters are each hiding their own secrets. 
 This book had a lot of action and there were several parts of the story that really grabbed me and made me worry about the characters. There were some interesting plot twists too that I did not see coming. Yes, there were a few things that I figured would happen, but they were small and didn't take away from me being captivated by the story. 
 I really like the characters. I think that they are well written. 
 Though I think I connected with Jin more than the other two. She is such a strong character. She has been through so much, yet she is determined to find her sister. She won't stop until she does. And her loyalty and strength gave me hope. 
 Dai is also a strong character, but he has a lot haunting him from his past. And I think I found his character to be the most mysterious. 
 I think Mei Yee is also strong in her own way. She wants to protect and help the other girls in the brothel. And she longs to get out. 
 And I really found it interesting how all three of their stories intertwine. 
 My Recommendation: 
 I found this to be a very interesting, action-packed story. It grabbed and held my attention from the beginning. I think that it is a dark and realistic story. And I really liked reading it. If you are looking for an gritty, fascinating story with diverse characters and good world building, then I highly recommend giving this book a read!

 This review was first published on my old blog: Her Reviews of Books Movies and Everything."
4,"Personally I would classify this as New Adult versus erotica. While there are some very explicit sexy times - it was just some dirty talk. Nothing I haven't read a hundred times before in non erotica labeled books. 
 I was prepared not to like it, thinking it was going to just be a dirty version of the Nightshade world but the characters and story were very engaging. 
 I haven't read the Nightshade series, so even though there was a prologue and some recap, I was lost for awhile. The writing & pacing was a bit awkward at first but really hit it's stride when the two protagonists met. Alternating POV's gave added perspective. 
 Ironically, for an erotic book, it's the sexy times that are the weakest. They felt awkward at times at first (agin...Robertson/Cremer hit her stride with these scenes as well). Throwing out crass language that felt forced but once Tristan and Sarah's relationship beings to grow - it really is about more than sex and I enjoyed how it developed. They make a great team and the sex became more about a bond than how dirty can we make this scene. 
 The world building surrounding the Keepers, Searchers and Guardians was fascinating and my favorite part. I can't wait to see how this all develops as the series continues."
3,Better than I expected it to be :)
4,"Damn, this book is good. I haven't read chemistry like this for a good long while. Mycroft and Rachel. Ship it, love it, OTP it. The teasing and the flirting, and the accidental and rather creative compromising moments that are so heart stoppingly will they/won't they, gah! So damn good. I like that Rachel is faster than him, and in many ways more competent and stronger than him. They complement each other so well. 
 I love reading books set in my own country. When places are mentioned I just have to let out a satisfied giggle because the places actually have meaning to me and it just makes the reading experience that much more awesome. I don't have an Australian accent and I don't really talk the way they do but I did so appreciate reading a different style of dialogue. Toward the end, I sort of lost interest but still a really enjoyable read. 
 The author does such a swell job of capturing the dynamic between the couple. Their interactions and their relationship is so spot on and well-executed. The details and the ins and outs of their friendship is just perfection. 
 Mycroft is a lot more like the BBC Sherlock in that he's eccentric and hot and so loveable even though he's so obnoxious and arrogant. He's still British and he's tall. I have a weakness for tall men. 
 Mycroft pales. ""Well, I'm not climbing that."" 
 ""Relax,"" I say, ""I'll climb it."" 
 ""No, you won't. You'll die."" 
 Rachel is not happy. She is a country girl and the city does not appeal. She used to live so far out in the outback she had to do distant learning for school. Suddenly being a ""townie"" is a cultural shock for her and for her family. I've experienced the same thing. Moving from acreage to a townhouse is a bizarre feeling and suddenly there's neighbours and suddenly you can't run through your property for hours. The claustrophobia and the fast life can really get you down. 
 Her family relations are so different and alive. I loved her big brother Mike and how she clashed with her mum and how she thought she got along with her dad but finding him adapting to city life when she always had his identity wrapped up as a farmer feels like a betrayal to her. All the complexities and feels! 
 The secondary characters of the goth Viet, Mai Ng, and her Sudanese boyfriend, Gus, is a nice touch. Sometimes Mai Ng is a little in-your-face stereotypical but I really liked Gus and how the author gave him quiet depth that just added so much to the story instead of just being an obligatory side piece."
5,"""Sweetie, I don't have many friends."" 
 ""I'm not your sweetie."" 
 Ah, a spine. So there was one under there after all. He liked a bit of sass in the right girl. ""Fair enough. I apologize."" 
 She nodded. ""Don't apologize . . . cupcake. Just don't do it again."" 
 ""Rob rubbed the back of his neck and looked embarrassed. ""You weren't supposed to see me."" 
 ""Yeah, well, you forget how tall I am in heels,"" she reminded him. He laughed, and looked down at her bare feet, and she wiggled her toes. ""I, um, took them off to run. I wanted to see if it was you."" 
 ""Well, this is fucking embarrassing,"" he said. 
 It was? Her heart broke a little at that statement. ""What are you doing here in New York City?"" 
 He stared at her for a long moment before answering. ""Stalking you."" 
 ""W-what?"" She could hardly believe her ears. ""Stalking me?"" So that was him all those times she'd thought she'd spotted him? ""Why are you stalking me?"" 
 ""I'm not really stalking,"" he said, glancing around and lowering his voice. ""Not in a creepy, illegal way. I just miss the goddamn hell out of you and thought maybe if I got to see you from afar, now and then, it'd hurt less. Still fucking hurts quite a bit, though."" 
 ""I love my tall, gorgeous amazon."""

But then she meets Lucas, a professor who splits his time between Paris and New York, who offers to be her tour guide for the day. This wasn't in Mia's plans. But neither was being sad, single, and alone in Paris. So she agrees. 
 Lucas is nothing like she expected. He doesn't fit into her description of an ideal man. But as he shows her around, telling her stories about landmarks and historic locations, she feels herself falling for him. It doesn't hurt that Lucas is 100% focused on her. Not on his job, not on other things he should be doing, and certainly not on himself. He's the polar opposite of her ex-fiance, and Mia soon realizes that she has real feelings for this man. 
 Frenched is a cute romance filled with lists, jokes, and more steamy scenes than I knew what to do with. This is a light, fluffy book that isn't going to make you cry, isn't going to make you tear your hair out, and isn't going to make you want to throw it across the room. It's just a great escape from real life. 
 Melanie Harlow is definitely an author to watch."
4,"This review also appears on my blog: The Starry-Eyed Revue. 
 Another great 2011 debut novel. And yet another fantastic start to another awesome trilogy. 
 Hereafter is the story of a girl who dies but seems doomed to haunt the river in which she met her death. Until she saves a boy from drowning in that same river, that is, and they fall for each other while trying to unravel the mystery of her death. 
 I liked this book, I really did, but here's the unfortunate reason why I just couldn't justify giving it that 5th star: the love story itself. Yes, it was beautiful and tragic and all the things I adore in a good love story. But it was also so very unrealistic in the way it developed. I mean, I don't know many people who, when told that they are standing face-to-face with a ghost, would a) believe that statement without question or proof and b) not balk at the idea and be completely accepting of that fact. Sure, an open-minded person could come to terms with it--especially after said ghost saved one's life--and could grow to love the ghost of a person, but this story was insta-love and that always grinds my gears a bit. 
 That said, the story itself was intriguing. Along with ghost-girl and lover-boy, there's an evil, sexy ghost guy vying for ghost-girl's soul. Trust that he's up to no good. Then there's lover-boy's witchy grandmother who would like nothing more than to exorcize ghost-girl. But most importantly, the story centers around finding out who ghost-girl is and how she died and why she's no longer walking around in the daze that she's known for the last decade or so. 
 It was definitely an enjoyable read and an amazing first book. And if lover-boy had at least been hesitant when he first found out ghost-girl was not of the living, maybe I'd have found the storyline a little more believable. As it is, it's a predictable love story that borders on saccharine-sweet. Definitely worth reading if you're into that kind of thing. I'll surely be picking up the next installment."
4,"This took me literally four weeks to read (and I put it down and read many other books during that time.) At times it really dragged for me, especially in the earlier parts of the book. I wanted to shake Marion Stone (the main character, the story told by him, he giving details of what was going on even when he was unconscious or otherwise absent). One particular error in judgment of his toward the end of the book rang false to me, and I also was extremely annoyed about it, and not just because I cared about him. Some things that happened were just a tad too convenient to be believable. And, I hate it when books have many pages without page numbers on them; this book has many, many missing page numbers. 
 So, it sounds as though I didn't much like this book. Yet, I considered giving it 5 stars, and I really did enjoy it, a lot. But, in part, because of the things I listed above, I couldn't give 5 stars to this book. 
 I would have actually liked to try this as an audio book because I've heard that it's excellent. But neither edition became available at the library quickly enough, and I had to buy a copy, so I bought and read a paperback edition. It's currently a very popular book. 
 I'd been warned about the graphic medical content, but I did fine with that. (I don't do so well in person, but experiencing it via the pages of books, I do well.) What grossed me out was the description of various foods eaten, including raw fresh meat. What devastated me the most was a scene with a dog and her puppies (page 247 of my edition). 
 I thought the book tended to get better and better as it went on, though I was engrossed from the start. 
 Captured perfectly was that exact moment (at age 12 for Marion and for myself) that feeling of childhood ending. 
 The epic like story is impressive, brilliantly told at times, but the main strength of this book is the depth and breadth of the characters and the relationships between them. They were startlingly vivid and just wonderfully written. I loved Ghosh, and felt more and more involved with the main character Marion Stone as the story went on. 
 The author is a physician and I think because of that he was able to bring some veracity to the book that another author might not have captured. I also like the way real history was inserted and how, at the end of the book, the reader is told what was true and what was not in this historical fiction novel. 
 The only true sadist I've ever known was a relative who was a general surgeon; it was refreshing to read a book about surgeons who, while all flawed human beings, were doing the best they could do."
3,"I felt like the first half of the book was filled with football references to every day life,and the whole book was filled with copious amounts of sex. 
 I actually liked this one OK minus the football references in the beginning, and allll the sex. I felt like the football references were overkill, we get that he's a football player ok? There's no reason to beat us over the head with it. Also all the sex, it was like they couldn't be within 15 ft of each other without needing sex, that's a LOT of sex, and it really wasn't needed. 
 I did like this book, and hoooo baby is that cover sexy or what?"
0,"DNF 70% 
 I'm sorry, but I don't understand all that hype with this book. I don't like the characters, for all that is happening in this book it should be exciting, but most parts are just boring. Just not my book, sorry."
3,"Interesting, but too brutal and gory for my taste."
3,It's a good read... nothing intense .
4,"i'm loving this series so much; i read the first book ages ago but then got swept up reading other things, but then i was sorting through my books and found the pile which was just this series (because after reading the first one i bought all the rest from amazon oops) and i'm just going to read them all at once now and revel in it. they're just so enjoyable, and relatively quick to get through as well. i just love this series so much already tbh #noshame"
4,"I understand why some readers have a problem with this book when they compare it to Divergent. 
 Tris and Four made decisions that frustrated me beyond belief. They kept secrets from one another even though it was clearly damaging their relationship and made them miserable. Tris wavered from being strong to over the top to almost breaking down, yet I could understand why. Clearly after the events at the end of Divergent she would be feeling insecure, scared and incredibly broken, so when you look at it from that perspective it makes sense that she behaved the way she did. 
 I really enjoyed the world building in this book, I didn't find it slow at all, all the things Tris pieced together were interesting and I really enjoy the world that's been created in this book. As for the ending...woah that throws everything off course. 
 So although I can appreciate why some people didn't enjoy this book nearly as much as Divergent I don't feel the same. The tone was very different but from my perspective it was fitting considering the events that were taking place."
4,Sweet (but predictable) .
5,"Unfortunately, I haven't gotten to read (all) of this book yet. 
 But if it's not even out yet and pissing off white supremacists, you know it's going to be amazing. Get your preorders in now."
3,"Original reveiw 4/21/13, 4 stars: Stargirl, Susan, Pocket Mouse. Whatever you call her, she is bright, beautiful and free. This character finds that primitive, almost instinct part of yourself that calls at individuality, that appreciates a spontaneous ukelele song, dancing in the rain, and seemingly infinite bunny hops. You cringe as Leo tries to rein her in because you know you might do the same. You cheer when she does. You dream of wandering through enchanted places. You hope you carry this story with you long enough to see the world differently. If only for a little while."
4,"I loved this book. While the story is a bit predictable, I loved it still. For two days I couldn't put this book down and now that I'm finished, I feel disappointed that it's over. 
 I will say the nursing home scenes were sad for me b/c it reminds me so much of how my grandfather must feel often. The loneliness that Jacob feels as an old man is overwhelming at times. I was so happy with the ending of the story."
4,"I don't know why it took me a long time to finish reading this one. It was good but I don't know, its 'stickiness' isn't that strong."
2,"I would like to preface this by saying if your hyped about this try it out but I couldn't get into this one. The writing was great but the plot was like a weird version of the movie Inception and Big Brother. I have come to realize that I am not as big a fan of Sci-fi as I tend to lean more towards fantasy. There was such great potential but the execution was not up to par for me. Yes, I'll admit I couldn't stop reading but that is because I was wanted to know what the hell was going on! The ending was abrupt and strange and it left me with way to many loose ends. Not cool. Anyhoo, maybe you'll like it better than I did."
4,"I really enjoyed this. It is definitely less madcap than the first book but just as funny. What can I say, I like jokes about balls and poop. Like, a lot. I also really liked that all of the blame for the relationship troubles weren't placed on Buck. And I really loved the ending. The next book's coming in January? CAN IT BE JANUARY RIGHT NOW, PLEASE."
4,"I picked this up because I heard it featured mental illness in a realistic manner, and I think that's something that's important, particularly in YA. I was not disappointed. 
 Maguire has a form of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) that developed in response to trauma. She's been around when some very bad things happened, and her survivor's guilt has kind of gotten out of control. The reader meets Maguire initially through her therapy session, where she is definitely a sullen teenager. Maguire's approach to her mental illness is one of the more realistic parts of the book. She at first very firmly believes that everyone else is crazy in refusing to acknowledge her ""bad luck."" But slowly with the help of her therapist she comes to see that maybe it's all in how she's perceiving the random universe, and that her magical thinking won't really fix anything. 
 While I didn't think having a love interest was necessary (why couldn't it be a friend for once), I get why Jordy was included and I liked him beyond the love interest part. Jordy's existence shows that therapy can be useful for things beyond more serious mental illnesses, such as relearning coping mechanisms or dealing with issues in your family. I also appreciated that for once there wasn't a love triangle. 
 I did think the writing was a little bit too simplistic for the audience, and I also thought that sometimes the descriptions were rocky. Some sentences read early first draft with the list of descriptors that are then repeated every time characters show up again. But I also think that YA readers who aren't used to seeing themselves (or their loved ones) in literature will be so enthralled by Maguire and her realistic therapy assignments and issues that they will quickly gloss over that. 
 Recommended to fans to contemporary YA lit looking for a realistic mental illness depiction. 
 Check out my full review. (Link will be live October 2, 2016). 
 *initial thoughts* 
 Some of the writing wasn't great but I really appreciated the realistic representation of mental illness in such a mainstream book."
5,"Tobias is trapped as a hawk. He can never go back. 
 And like Tobias, I cannot stop reading Animorphs. It is the Applegate's Gift. It is the Applegate's Curse. 
 This episode was surprisingly dark. I mean, it's pretty emo. But from an adult's perspective, the story grapples with loss, loneliness, thoughts of suicide and depression, and the nature of what it means to be human. It's the kind of YA fiction that doesn't talk down to its audience, which is why I really appreciated it. 
 In terms of action, also this book doesn't pull any punches, or grant them any easy wins. The Animorphs continue to have terrible, stupid plans that pretty much ought to get them killed. The low point is especially dark-- (view spoiler)[ the team is trapped inside a water tank with no way out, and they are considering committing suicide rather than allowing themselves to be discovered. (hide spoiler)] --That's hard core! 
 This was the first Animorphs book I ever read (my friends each bought different ones when the Scholastic fair came to our school) so it occupies a special place in my heart. Glad to say it held up."
5,"Ooh, Cara and Growl. Beauty and the Beast, mafia style????? 
 ____________________________________ 
 SO FUCKING WORTH THAT LONG ASS WAIT!!! 
 HEELLLLLLL YEAH!! 
 ____________________________________ 
 Such a beautiful story, with a timeless plot, an awesome theme, and original characters. Cara and Growl are seriously one-of-a-kind. I will never grow tired in rereading this book in the near future and will forever find the thrill in reexperiencing this world with lovable characters just as I do with the rest of the books in this series. 
 Now, if you don't mind. I will now be doing my first count in marathoning these books. Obviously I'm already needing the next book in this series like yesterday. Great, great work!. It's a given that this book will be part of my Favorites, and something that I'd highly recommend."
4,"I went into this book without really reading much about the premise, and I was pleasantly surprised that it is basically like Labyrinth meets The Forbidden Game, except set in a historical period in Bavaria. If you're not familiar with those works, both the Bowie film and the 90's YA series by L.J. Smith, deal with a teenage girl getting drawn into the world of the Goblin King, who challenges her to solve a puzzle or beat a game, or else end up as his bride. There are echoes of Persephone and Hades in this story, as the submission of the girl is supposed to usually save her world from some kind of earthly tragedy, like an eternal winter. In Wintersong, our heroine is 19-year-old Liesl, the eldest of her family who put her own wants on the backburner to help her family run their inn, and to ensure that her younger brother, Josef, can achieve his dreams of becoming a professional violinist. Liesl herself loves music as well, and secretly longs to be a composer, but the fact that she is a woman and is expected to care for her family prevents her from seeing that dream come to fruition. Meanwhile, she quietly resents her younger sister, Kathe, who is beautiful, materialistic, and intended to marry their childhood friend. Beneath the surface of this somewhat typical historical story, there is the folklore of the Goblin King, an immortal man (who in every iteration of this story is super, super hot) who rules over the underworld which is full of goblins, changelings, and horrifying creatures of mythology. He holds the balance between the world above and the world below, and, according to lore, he must take a human bride to keep the balance going. 
 S. Jae-Jones' writing throughout is captivating and engrossing, and if you enjoy historical settings and stories rich in lore, her style will be immensely readable. She does a really good job building the tension and growing the relationship between Liesl and her Goblin King, and I think circumvents the annoying Stockholm Syndrome-esque path to romance that this kind of story could have taken. The character development of our heroine, as well as of the Goblin King, is well-done, and I thought the side characters were pretty fleshed-out as well, and multi-dimensional. This book is beautifully written, well-paced, and definitely draws the reader into the world. I am very excited to read book two, which comes out next February, and get to visit this world again."
4,"Originally not YA, relaunched as such later."
0,Eh. Too young and simplified for my tastes. Cute concept but just not for me.
5,"As a huge fan of The Program books, I was extremely excited when I saw that there would be another book set in that world and I couldn't wait to get my hands on The Remedy. I wanted to see how everything began, and what happened before The Program and The Remedy lets us see all of that and more. 
 Quinlan McKee has been a closer since she was 7 years old. A closer is someone who can 'become' anyone to give closure to grieving families who have lost a loved one, and Quinlan is the best. Quinn is given her longest assignment yet, and quite possibly the hardest, because the person she's to become, Catalina Barnes, has a boyfriend and that boyfriend is part of Quinn's assignment. Will Quinn be able to give Catalina's family and boyfriend the closure they need without getting too attached? You'll have to read it to find out. 
 I really, really liked Quinn as our MC. She was smart and loyal, and although many people judge her for being a closer, she tried not to let it bother her because she knew the reason she was doing it, to help people. While I'm not sure how I would feel about someone coming in and taking on the role of a deceased loved one, I can understand how it could help some people. They have the opportunity to say everything that they didn't get a chance to, and I can see how that would be beneficial in the grieving process. 
 I also really loved the other characters as well. Deacon and Aaron were really great. They were both there anytime Quinn needed a reminder of who she was and they seemed to always sense exactly what she needed without her having to say the words, or ask for help. 
 Now, let's talk about that ending. It REALLY left me wanting more. I don't know if there will be another book, BUT OH MY GOSH I HOPE SO. You can't end a book like that and not give me more, I can't take it. I NEED MORE. 
 The Remedy was such an amazing addition to The Program series. As usual, Young's writing is flawless and the story is fascinating."
5,"I know I'm a few decades late to the party, but still I have to speak my mind and say that this is one of the best graphic novels I've ever read. ""The definitive Batman origin story?"" Now, I don't know about that -- Gordon's the real star here, and Miller's characterization of the main man himself leaves a lot of holes -- but generally this book shows me how great Batman can be. Not that I need a ton of reminding... Batman is probably the definitive super hero, that muse who has spawned the most and best creations. But of course, even the best at what he does sometimes loses his touch..."
2,"Meh. Nothing fresh, original, or very interesting here."
2,"There is some interesting commentary here, a few sections had me putting the book down and contemplating the questions raised, but these moments are too few and far between. 
 Smith's writing is excellent, particularly the very real, warts and all depictions of all of her characters but there is just too much dull story going on for them to truly shine. 
 As others have mentioned the first third of the book is by far the best, with Smith excellently illustrating the hot and cold, friendly rivalry relationship that so many children share with their best friend. Weaving in interesting commentary on mixed race families, the struggles of families living in housing projects, anti-privilege if you will, filled with true to life moments that anybody will relate too."
4,SO GOOD! #GimmeTheSequel
3,"As thematically interesting and stylistically intriguing as this novel was, it was kind of ... boring overall. The main character, the narrator, had a perspective and personality that was different and appealing and the story itself moved at a good pace, but once I set it down for the night, nothing strongly motivated me to pick it back up the next day other than it happened to be the book I was currently reading. I believe this is because there was no real tension in the novel. The over-arching plot wasn't in the forefront; there was no rush for the brothers to get back to their employer and it seemed like the brothers were never really in any kind of danger because they were great shots and had no sense of fear. In a sense, because they were the perfect killers, they were boring. And neither of them really changed. Eli seemed like he always harboured doubts about his profession and his brother was the same person on page 1 as he was in the final chapter. And as all other characters were transitory, no one else was around to modify or shift their perspectives. 
 I did like the setting. I like Westerns, but I also have no problem when people take liberties with realism, and the ""old West"" of this novel seemed more a hyperbole of the true ""old West"" than a legit portrayal. The novel most reminded me of Quentin Tarantino movie - the characters were anti-heroes and violent, and the setting allowed or encouraged bloodshed. And the strange, dark, cynical humour that pervaded almost reminded me of Tarantino, but also made me wonder whether the entire thing had something else going on beneath the lines. 
 But, unfortunately, I didn't like the novel that much to spend much time deliberating over it in that regard. 
 I'm not even sure who I'd even recommend this novel to, as it's not really a Western but it's too much of a Western to be anything else."
2,"The premise is SO cool. Kirby is great. The rest of it... nah. I'm super not here for sex for the sake of a grittier tone, and benevolent old men crushing on very young women. And violence against trans people. 
 I'd give this a hard pass if explicit and dubiously consensual sex (LOTS), graphic violence (LOTS), or animal harm (one instance) are upsetting to you. 
 So disappointed, I really wanted to like this book. ):"
5,"Holy shit, what the actual fuck did I just read? This has to be the bloodies, goriest, most disturbing manga I have and ever will read. 
 And I freaking love it! That doesn't make me weird/psychotic does it? o.o 
 I love all the characters, and the plot is just asdfghjkl. 
 I think my favourite character so far is Kazuo. He's wonderful! 
 I can't wait to see who gets killed next read the next volume!"
5,"Is this truly the end of the road? 
 I missed Mel and Liam so much. Especially Mel. She's one of my favorite, crazy heroines. It was so amazing to be back with the Callahans. As always these people are crazy and badass and all that is happening will spin your head, and break your mind. 
 I loved the kid's POV in this one. It was new and refreshing (also the fact that they will have their own stroy is so amazing!) I loved all the dynamics in this story. Mel with the kids, that was something to read about. Liam with Mel and kids. Brothers, both those grown up and kids. Donatella was a true mafia princess. 
 ""I'm a living, breathing telenovela"" 
 This quote is so perfect for everything Mel! It was so great to read once more about this family that I loved from the first book. Were there some things that were too crazy? Sure. Were there issues with the plot? Yes. 
 But overall I love this series very much. I was entertained through every book. It is not just smut and hotness, tho let me tell you about that. Mel and Liam are scorching hot, but they are also sexy and funny, and murderous! For a crazy reader like me, who likes all these 
 features in her book it is a wonderfull series, and I will be back. Back to re-read this one, and back for more in this universe! Give me everything Callahans!"
5,"I've been anticipating this book for such a long time, even before it actually being announced. I've been watching Carrie's videos for a long time and when I heard her mention in her ""Queen of Procrastination"" video that her goal is to write a book, I was already looking forward to holding that book in my hands. Carrie is so full of talent and creativity and I was really excited when she announced her first fiction novel. I was almost scared my expectations were too high but they were exceeded. 
 This book blew me away. It's one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. Made it right into my top books of 2016, my favourite of all time and my heart. I was captivated from the first page on. 
 I went into the book not knowing too much about the story but I already senses that it would be right up my alley. While it is a contemporary book and focuses a lot on relationships between people, it is VERY heavy on the magical realism, so if you don't enjoy that I think you should stay away. But magical realism is one of my favourite things and really added to the magic this book contains. 
 Also.. it's sad. It's super fucking sad. I mean it's also really happy and just in general emotional but if you're a weeper (like me), expect tears. I had to wipe actual big fucking tears away while finishing the book, I wasn't able to read the last page because my eyes wear so full of tears. And then I just hugged the book really, really close to my chest. 
 I am still a little in awe and honestly don't know what else to tell you. This book will definitely stay with me for a really long time and I cannot wait for more of Carrie's work in fiction!"
4,"Buying the combined edition of the first two books couldn't have worked out better for me. Not only was it a cheap deal via The Book Depository, it was also a pretty kick-a book with enjoyable characters and an awesome world of supernatural beings. 
 ""Our heats want the good to win. We're still afraid, we still make mistakes, but if we listen to what our hearts want, we will find the right way"" 
 The story. The book kicks off with Kylee's dad moving out of their house. We learn that she's a daddy's girl and has recently lost her beloved grandmother. Her mom is described as an ice queen with the personality of a stick. She sends Kylee off to a camp that supposedly deals with troubled teens after her daughter gets caught in a raid at a party where there are drugs and alcohol in possession of teenagers. When she reaches the camp, she realizes it's full of freaks who claim to have supernatural blood in them. Kylee has a tough time navigating between this new world, her family drama, two hot guys and an ex-boyfriend, and searching for herself. Oh, and enter criminal activity among these weird creatures. Sounds like summer is about to be great for our heroine. 
 My thoughts. I had no idea this'd be so much fun. I have enjoyed very few werewolf books. This one wasn't only wolves though--we have vampires, faeries, wtches and even ghostwhisperers. Everyone kept talking about this awesome cast of characters, fun plot and two very, very great love interest (#teamLucas). Now I know what they were talking about! I enjoyed Kylee's relationship with camp's head Holiday and her roommates Della and Miranda. Kylee's sarcasm and snarky attitude were hilarious and she does everything with her heart in the right place. I liked how she didn't back down from a challenge and took selfless actions in order to provide the safety of her friends. We also get to some development of the side characters which was nice. My favorite relationship was Burnett and Holiday. I have a feeling we'll see more of them in the future. Their chemistry was sizzling and fun! 
 I liked most of what was going on in this book, but what I didn't enjoy was Kylee's constant 'omg, he's so hot and i want to kiss him' thoughts regarding Derek and Lucas. Also, I bet it's hard to accept one's supernatural roots, but she was more excited about having a tumour than being supernatural. Are you for real? I'd pick being supernatural any day of the week instead of a tumor. If one were to have a tumour, one's brain wouldn't have the pattern of a natural human being. She was unique and none of the other supernaturals couldn't read her pattern nor her mind and that caused a lot of fuss over her inheritance which I think will be revealed as the series progresses as we don't get a clear answer about her supernatural being. 
 I'm glad I gave this series a try since it turned out to be fun, exciting, surprising and original. I had no idea what I was missing out on. Kylee as a heroine is somewhat frustrating at times with her head between the three guys who want her bad, but you know what? It was still a hilarious adventure and overall Kylee is a strong, selfless main character and I wouldn't mind reading the rest of the series asap. Luckily, thanks to that combined edition, I already own book #2 and now I'm just going to have to wait to pick it out of those paper slips I did to pick my next read randomly. Oh, and it's likely one of those books that is better when you re-read it. I hope you guys liked it or give it a chance when you're in need of a fun, sassy paranormal read. 
 More of my reviews can be found my blog."
2,"Originally reviewed here. 
 Unsurprisingly, I was really looking forward to The Glimpse, because of that magic word dystopia, and because I seriously love the cover. It's both simple and fantastic, even if it does seem much more suited to the plot line of Delirium. My hopes definitely went down as I saw some reviews rolling into the blogosphere. None of the reviews I saw were overly positive, and I was pretty bummed. Still, I determined to read it myself, because I do try to read all of the dystopias. 
 Anyway, I actually liked The Glimpse, although I can see why it might have given other readers some trouble. What pulled me through the book was definitely the concept, which was something pretty new to me on the dystopian front, always a plus. In this future, the world has been divided up into the haves and the have-nots, only the dividing line is not race or wealth or attractiveness: it's sanity. 
 Society is divided up into Pures, those without any genetic markers indicating a disorder (ex. depression, bipolar, ADHD, etc.) and Crazies. The Pures live within beautiful communities and have pretty much everything they need. Their society isn't much different from ours, although they now get married through an antiquated process called Joining. 
 I found the whole division based on mental stability entirely fascinating. Imaginging society spazzing out about the ever-increasing number of people suffering from some sort of mental disorder is not really a stretch at all. That could definitely be something that a despotic government might want to control. Basically, this could be a way of helping Darwinism along by trying to get the healthiest people to stick together and procreate. 
 Though I really liked that, the characters never really felt real to me at all. I wasn't especially invested in them. I wanted to know what happened, but I didn't particularly care whether the main couple made it work or if they won out against the bad guys. They weren't terrible characters. Really, on paper, I should have liked Ana, but...meh. Whereas in a lot of books, the dialog is what makes the book move along for me, in this one it was definitely the longer paragraphs of description here. 
 Perhaps what distanced me from the characters was due to some weakness in the plotting. I often felt like the characters, mostly Ana, made completely illogical decisions. Not in a real life, people do stupid things kind of way, but in a wtf just happened kind of way. Ana would think things over and decide that the obvious choice in some situation was X, and I would be sitting there going, ""Why would you ever do that in response to this situation? FACEPALM."" 
 To sum up, the world building was really cool, but I thought everything else could use some more work. Despite thebook's limitations, I do think I will probably be reading the sequel. This one definitely isn't for everyone, but, if you like the premise, you may want to give it a go."
2,"this one was kinda boring in retrospect of the first one, I hope specials is better."
3,"Great follow up to Ten Tiny Breaths. My heart was breaking reading about how Cole was feeling. This novella is short, but worth the read! 
 I really liked Ten Tiny Breaths and I want to know more about Cole!"
5,Apparently I'm loving everything I'm reading right now. 4.5 stars... but I can't bring myself to click on the 4 star rating.
3,"*3 stars* 
 ""I had no illusions about love anymore. It came, it went, it left casualties or it didn't."" 
 I enjoyed this one. Not as much as I did my first Sarah Dessen book but it was still good. Light and humorous. I just couldn't connect with the heroine unfortunately. But I absolutely loved Dexter and John Miller because these two are so adorable and quirky and hilarious. Truth Squad, Dexter's band, was the highlight of this book for me. Dexter's dog, Monkey, was also a hoot. 
 This Lullaby tells the story of Remy Starr who, after seeing her mother remarry multiple times and never meeting or knowing her father, is cynical about love. Most of her close friends also share this attitude and I found this depressing. I was glad that Remy's brother wasn't as opposed to love and was even in a happy relationship. He and Dexter (plus the Truth Squad guys) kind balanced out the girls' doubt at least. Remy and Dexter's first meeting was amusing. His lines made me grin so bad. How could you not come to love Dexter though?! He's an actual ray of sunshine. 
 ""The fate of your heart is your choice and no one else gets a vote."" 
 Remy's mother was a character that grew on me. I didn't pay much attention to her at first. It was almost like Remy was portraying her as weak because of all her failed marriages. There was a moment in the book where they have a heart-to-heart that it made me tear up like crazy. Sarah Dessen definitely has a knack of pulling my heart strings with touching family dynamics *wipes tear*. 
 Like my last Sarah Dessen read though, the heroine didn't capture my heart like the hero, or a few of the secondary characters, did. I wasn't the biggest fan of Remy. The only times that I did like her were when she was with Dexter/Truth Squad, go figure. Imagine how happy I was when Remy's look on love slowly changed. Remy was independent and headstrong, and I did come to admire her for those qualities. Luckily, Dexter is the kind of character that makes everything better. So I powered through for him and I'm glad I did! It was definitely nice to read the backstory of two characters that peaked my interested in Just Listen!

5,"Taylor has to go back to the summer house with her family for the first time in 5 years. Not only does she have to deal with the fact that her dad is dying but she also has to cope with living near her ex boyfriend and ex best friend. 
 I found the whole of this book so emotional. What Taylor went through was so difficult. I loved seeing how her and her dad tried to get to know each other as well as they could knowing they didn't have long left and it broke my heart every time she realised how little time they had. The way her relationship changed throughout with her siblings and mother was perfect as well. As horrible as it was for them to go through it definitely seemed to bring the family closer together. 
 The rest of the book dealt with her relationships with Lucy and Henry. I kept wondering what she could have possibly have done that was so bad at twelve years old that they would still hate her now and then it became obvious the main thing they hated was the way she ran away when things got tough. Taylor knew her weakness and she fought through it in the end. I loved Henry, and his connection with Taylor was so strong. Lucy was also a very fun character. 
 This book may be emotional but it made me laugh as well and it made me remember not to take my own parents for granted. I realised I don't even know what my dad's favourite song or film is. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone."
5,"Sophie is turned into a 90 year old woman after she upsets the notorious Witch of the Waste. She decides to take residence in the wizard Howl's moving castle as their cleaning lady, hoping her curse will be broken. She will clean all his rooms (mostly against his will), befriend his apprentice Michael and fire demon Calcifer and end up trying to help Howl who has got a curse of his own. 
 I was not surprised after reading in an interview with Diana Wynne Jones, that many young girls declare themselves to be in love with Howl. And it really is hard not to fall for him. The vain, charming, dashing and powerful wizard Howl. The coward, the liar, and the heart-breaker. 
 But - the real hero of this story is Sophie. You will find yourself rooting for her once she turns into an old woman. Now Sophie will speak her mind, be rude and gruff when she feels like it and not stand for Howl's messiness or his heart-eating or his slitherer-outer ways. She will put everyone in their place and win over their hearts. 
 Howl's Moving Castle is a really fun, short read. I feel that each sentence of this book is precious and perfect. I also love Hayao Miyazaki's anime adaptation, but for some reason they are loosely related. I suppose I can say that I love the anime as a separate thing, the artwork is just beautiful. Nevertheless, it is a mystery to me why they did not add the Wales storyline to the anime. (view spoiler)[It is just bizarre when Howl steps through the castle door to a world of cars and computers, and I love that sort of thing. (hide spoiler)] It makes me feel like I'm a part of this story, now that it takes place in my reality as well. 
 This is truly a book for all ages. I recommended it to my thirteen year old cousin yesterday, and I recommend it to you now, whatever age you are. Here it is, with simple prose, some comedy, a bit of romance and the very best storytelling."
4,"Honestly, I only picked this one up for the last story. So, I can't really comment on the rest of the stories. I really liked ""Something Old, Something New"". I was hoping for an epilogue that showed the couples getting after the events of Winter. This one was perfect and just what I needed to walk away from the series feeling satisfied. I got my HEAs and can walk away a happy woman!"
2,"It was ok, but the story had no plot line and it just felt like a hack and slash with no meat behind it. An interesting concept though and I did like the 4th wall aspect."
5,"Lena has come a long way from the girl she was at the beginning of the series. In Pandemonium, we see her inner strength begin to shine. Lena has lost a lot and at first she is ready to give up but then she reminds herself of what she has sacrificed for freedom and she finds the will to go on. The people who live in the Wilds have a life of deprivation and hardship. Food and medicine are scarce and they have to be constantly vigilant for signs of danger. Still, they find a way to thrive. Their leader, Raven, is a tough young woman who is at times admirable for her strength and at other times she behaves in deplorable ways. She reminded me of some of the people in Mockingjay. There were several times that Pandemonium brought that book to mind as we find out more about the Resistance movement. I was also reminded of Crossed by Ally Condie because of Lena's time in the Wilds and Cassia's struggles in the Outer Provinces. 
 Some people may not like Pandemonium because of the cliffhanger ending. I have to admit that I was a little disappointed though not surprised by it as things like that often happen in trilogies. Still, I think Lauren Oliver is an excellent writer and I enjoyed most of the book. I am hopeful that I will love book three even though I was slightly disappointed with Pandemonium in the end. There are enough surprises and plot twists to entertain, there is good character development for Lena, and even some romance. I liked the introduction of new characters and look forward to seeing where the story will take them. Overall I thought Pandemonium was a worthy sequel to Delirium and I can't wait to find out what happens in Requiem.

2,"Originally reviewed on A Reader of Fictions. 
 Before I got to read this one, I saw a few non-flattering reviews roll in, so I was on my guard, prepared for another in a string of disappointing reads. Thankfully, I enjoyed Beta pretty much all the way through, although I am definitely immensely skeptical about where the series is heading. 
 Beta takes place on an island paradise, home to only the richest and most fashionable of people. These people are so rich that they have clones, programmed to be emotionless and get work done perfectly, to take care of them, because, honestly, human butlers and nannies are just so last season. The rest of the world is not so nice, and is very different from the one we know today. Details on that are somewhat limited in Beta, but I hope to learn more about the Water Wars and what the cities are like in later installments. 
 I do need to talk for a bit about the concept of the clones to serve this island. Honestly, I don't get it. They talked about why they needed them: because good labor is too difficult to find, since the island didn't have natives and travel to the island is exceedingly expensive. That's nice and all, but I'm FAIRLY CERTAIN that producing clones is about 80 billion times more expensive than that. Also, the whole process seems suspect to me. For one thing, the person being cloned is supposed to be dead, which makes me wonder where all of the hot, dead people are coming from. Another problem with I have with this is the whole business about how they separate out the soul from the body. Did I miss when we figured out where the soul is? Has a physical soul been located in the future? 
 Betas are not supposed to be able to feel or taste anything. They should be, essentially, like robots. Elysia, our heroine, is a beta, a test clone for the new teen line. Because she is gorgeous (stacked), she sells quickly and goes to serve as a companion in the home of a wealthy family. It quickly becomes apparent that Elysia is not what a clone should be, which I am thankful for, since her first person story would have been VERY boring were she actually the way clones are meant to be. 
 Thankfully, I did not find her narration boring at all. Cohn's writing often amused me and I really liked the rhythm of it. Basically, she used the beginning clone section for comedic value. Even early on, it's apparent that something is wrong with Elysia's programming because she is so incredibly curious. As such she asks lots of inappropriate questions. For additional reader amusement, she interprets things very literally, like wondering where a girl 'puts out the sex.' This humor was obvious, but I must admit I was still entertained. 
 Cohn makes an attempt at twists, and there are several in here. Most of them I saw coming from miles away. Pretty much as soon as a character was introduced, I would predict that x and y would happen to them and then a hundred pages or more later, it would. The twists at the end did get me, though, I will admit. Basically, there are enough surprises that she'll likely catch you off guard once or twice. 
 For most of the book, I was okay with the romance. Just okay. I don't especially care for either guy (yes, a love triangle, and one that I suspect I will come to loathe). Tahir sounds totally dreamy. Were I Elysia, I would be all over that one, because he sounds delicious. Besides, he's actually there, which helps. Still, I did not really experience any feels at their romance. Mostly, I just wanted her to enjoy herself, because why the hell not. The other boy has a history with her First, aka the girl she was cloned from, and she knows him from a brief memory. He holds no appeal for me. Still, the dynamics of the love triangle were interesting enough thus far. 
 Did you notice that I have mentioned THE END a couple of times as having been somewhat distinct from the rest of the novel for me? GOODNESS GRACIOUS, THE ENDING. I really wish that I could talk about this in detail with you guys, but I won't because spoilers. Here's what I can say. Things get darker, which I give Cohn props for. Something I thought was coming but kind of didn't think would happen because it usually doesn't in YA DID happen, and it was painful. That part of the end was good in a painful way. 
 THEN there's some things that I am just all kinds of not cool with, which sucks because I had such a pleasant reading experience up to that point, despite my nitpicking above. What it comes down to is that some trope-ish things happen all in a row and I am REALLY concerned about whether I will like the next book at all. If anyone has read this book, I would love to discuss! 
 So, for the review skimmers, I will say that I enjoyed reading Beta quite a bit, but I am not altogether sure how I feel about it. A lot will hinge on whether you like Cohn's writing and what happens in book two."
4,"Every time has its heroes (or anti-heroes). Aftertime has Cass! 
 A troubled young woman who feels used. By other people and by her own passions. Only her daughter, Ruthie, gives meaning to her life. But they are apart and there are some groups of people who make it very difficult for Cass to re-unite with little Ruthie. 
 Oh! There are some flesh eating creatures, who used to be real people. They call them Beaters, I say they are zombies. The scary kind. The kind I like! 
 What can I say? I'm a zombie fan. Yes, I like reading about survivors who want to live and fight every way they can. About survivors who don't care about anything anymore and succumb to their lust. Yes, I enjoy a good post-apocalyptic story and (sometimes) some bloody gross descriptions of chewed flesh. *yuck!*"

 ""Oh, really?"" 
 ""Really, really. Why would I want to watch other people kissing,"" I say, ""when I could be kissing you? 
 This book managed to make me squeal and the last time I did that was with Eleanor & Park. This book is so lovely and I love the writing style and pacing and the characters (except Martin and, obviously, the bullies) so much, I kind of want to live in their universe :'] 
 I like Simon, a lot. He reminded me of Max-Ernest from The Secret Series for some reasons. I love how the writer didn't make him a stereotypical gay which made me realize - despite my own sexual orientation - that LGBT+ people is no different from Straight people (except for the sexual orientation part) and that stereotyping and putting them in a box is wrong. 
 I really like this one particular quote, ""White shouldn't be the default any more than straight should be the default. There shouldn't even be a default"".

 ""Or we could just go to a live show. I mean, I don't actually know anything about music, but I'm guessing it would be fun if it was with you."" -> relatable 
 ""And I can't imagine a scenario where I won't want to kiss your face off as soon as I see you. Just wanted to make that perfectly clear."" -> also relatable 
 ""I want to hold your hand,"" 
 ""So hold it,"" This is the part where I squealed really hard. 
 love this book. 10/10. would recommend"
3,"3.25 stars. This was an okay read. I have to say it's probably my least fave CL book. It's been so long since I read this that I don't remember details, but I may go back and reread this one so I can review in more detail later. So I only have just a few comments. I liked Pippa. She was funny and sweet. Jenson was ok. I felt like he didn't fully appreciate Pippa. He was so insistant that she was flighty and acted like she wasn't good enough for him. I felt bad for Pippa and that she had to be the pursuer to get Jenson to be with her. I felt like the conflict was resolved at the very end with no time to see them as an actual couple. The writing was good and the story was interesting, but, overall, this one missed the mark for me. That said, I did like the epilogues at the end that gave a glimpse into the future of all the couples in the series and I am sad that it is over."
4,"Don't expect to sleep easily. 
 Let the Right One in is an unpleasant, disturbing book. Fitting for a horror novel. The light in this story is almost nonexistent, and where there is light, darkness is there also. The main theme of this story is love that does not work out. There is no Twilight-esque romance in this story. The relationships are all sordid and bleak. 
 Let the Right One In is chilling from start to finish. From the first killing of a kid to the scene at the pool, this is a violent book featuring some of the creepiest characters to ever roam the pages of a horror novel. I found myself grimacing at several points in the book, just from the violence. The cast, for the most part, is unsympathetic. The hero even starts out unsympathetic. The only form of light in this story is because of Eli and Oskar's friendship, without which the book would have been an amalgamation of violence and broken relationships and more violence. 
 Let the Right One In is not for the faint of heart. It will almost assuredly disturb you, as it did me. I confess I read this book in the private of my home, not wanting one of my squeamish friends to see it and try it out for themselves or have to explain it to them. That being said, if a good horror novel is what you want, you cannot do much better outside of Stephen King. A creepy, disturbing, and malevolent vampire tale with good writing, Let the Right One In is highly recommended for fans of horror, but I discourage anyone else from reading it."
2,"Well, I didn't expected more here and still I was disappointed. I mean... when you hear that the book is prequel to something you kinda expect to REALLY be prequel to that thing. Not that this book wasn't. It was, but not in the direction I would like to be. 
 Here everything spun around what happens after the sun flares mentioned in ""The Maze Runner"". They're practically the reason why people reached to the idea to build the damn maze. That's all nice (not literally of course) and stuff, but seriously?! What I really wanted to read here wasn't new character and different time lines and all. I wanted to read about the Maze. Like about those 2 years in which the boys were trying to survive before Thomas shows up. That would have been nice!!! But no! We have to deal with new characters, new problems and a bunch of loony-tunes. 
 Still the book was fine, but I won't lie if I say that I couldn't wait to finish it. Something was missing and I don't really know what, but I couldn't get hooked at all. You're probably wanted know how can I be that sure? Well, when you're in the middle of the book and you hope all characters to die already... that's when (I mean, those people were suffering, they needed peace)! Still... admiration for the prologue and the epilogue (at one point that seems as the only things connected with ""The Maze Runner""). 
 If you ask me if you should read that I has to say - no. If you curious - just read the beginning and the end - you won't be miss anything, I promise."
4,"***ARC Provided by the Author and InkSlingerPR*** 
 About halfway through this book, I started craving a cocktail. Really no idea why. 
 Wait, maybe it was the hot chef, the crazy good chemistry, and the numerous drinks with great names. 
 Guessing that was it. 
 I enjoyed this book a lot. I loved the enemies to lovers aspect and I really liked Parker and Raven. I related to them, and I loved that at this point, the hatred and the fighting are really more habit than anything else. This definitely assists with the transition to romantic as you see them really kind of liking one another, without wanting to, but not really able to point to a reason for their hatred. 
 There were some places where I felt Parker was a little underdeveloped and I did want a little more info about him, the job he just left, for example. But for the most part the characters were solid, you believe them, and you believe the situations and their reactions to them. 
 This only my 2nd book by Emma Hart (no, I am not sure how that happened either) and I definitely am looking forward to her next title! 
 I recommend this book."

4,"A LOVELY ARRANGEMENT 
 laurelyn Prescott is travelling to Australia with her best friend Addison. Laurelyn is glad to be away for the next three months after her disastrous love affair. Addison's brother Ben is in Australia on a wine science program, so she and Addison are going to stay with him. 
 Laurelyn can tell instantly that Ben is attracted to her, but no way is she going there. Addison has paired up with Ben's friend Zac. Leaving Laurelyn trying to avoid Ben's obvious interest. The first night they are out in a club, where Laurelyn gets up to sing, as she is a musician by profession, and its an open mic. But someone else has become focused on her. Jack McLachlan a wine making millionaire. Jack has come to Wagga Wagga for the next three months, and has come to the club to look for a woman, who might be willing to spend that time with him. 
 Jack doesn't do relationships, he has short term partners, whom he has a special arrangement with. He doesn't ask for their real name nor does he give his. It's all about sex. He does like to spoil the lady of the moment. But when their time is up they go their separate ways. Usually these relationships last a matter of weeks. But this will be the longest time he has asked a woman to be with him for three months. Laurelyn has already garnered his interest, he is determined that for the next three months she will be his. 
 This is part one, of Jack and Laurelyn's story. The next is due this summer. A bit too long of a wait IMO. I liked this book it was well written. I thought the secret identities was a weak plot device, especially as Jack was a fairly famous personality, and darling of the newspapers. So trying to keep his real name and financial status a secret from the woman of the moment seemed a bit silly. 
 Having said that Jack was a dream character, he's hot and sexy, but really attentive. Laurelyn was a very likeable character as well, I could see how she was agreeable to Jack's proposition after her previous bad experience, a no strings attached affair sounded great to her. Plus Jack being totally gorgeous sweetened the deal. I liked the chemistry between them, and the sex was passionate. This does end on a sort of cliffhanger. But I will be reading part two."

4,Wowzers!! What an improvement from the first one! SO much depth to the story and it took a really dark turn as well as breaking my heart into a million pieces EVERY. SINGLE. CHAPTER!
4,"You want everything to turn out alright, but this is Mira Grant kids, there's never a happily ever after for your characters. It begins with a really fun spinoff of the SyFy channel and the countless monster/disaster/combined something Z-Grade movies that have been released and we find ourselves with our characters on the ship Atargatis filming a documentary about mermaids. 
 However, we're actually in the middle of a documentary showing us the fate of the Atargatis, through a series of flashbacks and descriptions of the found footage. I could see this working as a film quite easily, and it just makes me want more Mira Grant!"
2,"A well written book but too dark and gory for my tastes--and I only got through the first section. I'm afraid of how splattery it might have gotten in later sections. Pains me to give it a low score, because I admire Bick's writing, but the gratuitous gore grossed the hell out of me."
4,"With this book, we progress further into a deeper mystery, similar to the structure of first trilogy. I particularly enjoyed Sanderson's resistance to replaying common fantasy/literary tropes and instead developing distinctive characters with relatable wants and needs. Wayne is especially amusing, and I've developed quite a liking for Steris. The book's final revelation was as emotional as it was unexpected, and the final scene was wonderfully heartfelt. Can't wait for the next installment."
5,"If you would have told me even just three years ago that I would willingly listen to a 35-hour biography of one of our Founding Fathers (but not even one who became President!), I probably would have laughed in your face. Such is the power of musical theatre in my life. I loved the soundtrack for the Hamilton musical, so I wanted to read the source material. I was not disappointed. Probably the most engaging biography of a dead white dude I've ever read. I learned so much and it sparked my interest in discovering even more. Chernow writes in such an engaging way that my interest never waned over the 35 hour listen. I'm so delighted to have enjoyed this so much - I can't wait to read his biography of Washington! And now I need to read one on John Adams, Jefferson, and Burr!"
3,"So maybe it's because my family's from southeast Asia, but all the family pressure stuff the hero had to deal with made it pretty hard for me to like aWiM. Having to deal with it myself, on a regular basis...well reading about it sorta made the escapism I was looking for, out of reach. 
 But take that part of the story out of the equation, and I still don't think I'd be able to say I liked it. 
 I blame the heroine. She was just a little too understanding about every damn thing....she wasn't a pushover, but I'd have liked some anger, or hell, even a hissy fit from her. 
 And how things were resolved...well it may just be me, but it all came about a little to easily....and again it's the heroine that mostly bugs me...she finds out the truth, and isn't worried about her life at all, really? 
 It wasn't a bad book though....it was pretty well written, if predictable, though I liked the set up....It's nowhere near my favorite VLT title ( her nerd series was so much better) nor does it rank anywhere near my favorite PNR titles, but it's an easy, light read....just don't set your expectations too high. 
 somewhere between 2.5 and 3 stars."

 Once I got over the repetitiveness, I had a few more qualms with the book: 
 - For a book set in the 18th century it read like a contemporary. Aside from the scattered mention of corsets and lady-like/ Gentlemanly behavior, the dialogue as well as the characters interaction seemed very much 21st century. 
 - Everyone was just so shallow. Maybe it's cause this is Y.A.? I don't know, but ugh they were as 3-dimensional as cardboard cut-outs. 
 - Jem's story was so lame. 
 On the other side of negativity, here are some positive notes: 
 - At least Clare was consistent. We had the Lightwoods and Magnus Bane, which feature in the Mortal Instruments. And the Shadowhunters retained the same backstory. 
 - It's a fun and fast read. I enjoyed reading it, as shallow as it was. Sometimes you need light and brainless books. 
 - I'm intrigued to find out Will's story and Tessa's full background. Clare has piqued my interest. 
 - I'm a sucker for arrogant messed up boys. I can't resist them.

3,"Lola and the Boy Next Door is Stephanie Perkins's companion novel to Anna and the French Kiss. This book follows Lola Nolan, a girl who loves costumes and has an older, edgy boyfriend Max. Then Cricket Bell, Lola's childhood crush, moves back in next door to her, and what she thought was certain before shakes with his return. 
 This book is cute and fun, but doesn't quite stand up to its older sister companion book. Lola's fun and quirky, until she breaks down for a minuscule reason. Cricket's sweet and devoted, which makes three hundred pages leading up to him and Lola finally get together wearisome toward the end. The facts of Lola's life and relationship are so blatant that this slow-going budding romance gets a little bit old. It definitely has its cute moments, but isn't quite up to par with the first of this companion series. Due to sex and drug references but none to limited details, this book is best suited for mid to older teens and will appeal to girls."
4,"I'm actually pretty excited about this book! While I was fine with the Mortal Instruments series, I'm already liking this one a lot better. The author has obviously benefited from having another series under her belt and she's really brought that experience to Clockwork Angel. The one thing I'm not a huge fan of is the guys. Can she have any love interests who don't make me want to hit them?"

 I had high hopes. That may have been where I went wrong. Too high expectations. Oh well."
5,"5 surreal Hempstock stars. 
 Few spoilers ahead. Tread with care. 
 A long while since I last got hold of a Gaiman book. There's this certain bibliophile friend of mine, who goes by the name Broke, and has made all of his acquaintances broke even. It is through this great soul that I started retracing my love for Gaiman. 
 ""The Ocean at the end of the lane""- What is the impression your mind gains when such a name reverberates through your head? If you ask me in one word- Peculiar. And Peculiar is synonymous with Gaiman. 
 This is a fable of a little boy of seven, reserved in disposition, lonely and bullied by other urchins of his age and about Lettie Hempstock whom he met by mere chance. When the little boy accompanies Lettie to the forbidden woods in search of an adventure, magic unfurls itself in manifold ways, that seeps through his life and buzzes around him like a notorious flea escaping from the unknown. 
 There is so much more to this book than what meets the eye. The uncomplicated yet dream-like quality of language within these few hundred pages bear significant meaning and character. You know those books which seem like a simple children's tale on the outset, but is relatable to every adult who has been a child once upon a time. In this regard, this book resembles one of my favorite stories for children, The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery 
 ""Grown-ups don't look like grown-ups on the inside either. Outside, they are big and thoughtless and they always know what they're doing. Inside, they look just like they always have. Like they did when they were your age. The truth is, there aren't any grown-ups. Not one, in the whole wide world."" 
 The story captures your interest because of the simplicity with which it unfolds. There is magic, there is fantasy, there are strange, peculiar tidbits happening here and there. Its a mystical world Gaiman creates, and its almost as if you dissolve into it. 
 Of all, some things stood out for me in this book. One was the protagonist's love for books, that came as a respite everytime he felt lonely or miserable. 
 "" ""Growing up, I took so many cues from books. They taught me most of what I knew about what people did, about how to behave. They were my teachers and my advisers."" 
 I guess we all can relate to that. I am what I am partly, because of books that shaped and reshaped me from time to time. 
 Then there comes the old Mrs. Hempstock. She is undoubtedly the female version of Albus Dumbledore. When she is around, no matter what bad befalls you, how many limbs you sprout out, how many bad witches chase you, you stay calm because you know she is here. And there's absolutely nothing, nothing in this world that she can't make, break or repair. 
 Then there comes the part where Old Mrs. Hempstock asks the boy if he wants the memories of his father's abuse to stay back. He replied back as to let them be. That he wants himself to remember them, because they are a part of who he is. This might be a trivial instance for many, but I think a boy of 7, who is so confident of withstanding the horrors of that time stands a step ahead of others. I don't know if I would have wished the same, had I been in his place. 
 Lastly, the ocean. Which is matter-of-factly, a duck pond, but is not so in many ways. Isn't that what laws of magic teach us? You never feel it, until you believe in it. 
 5 rich Gaiman stars."

 It's set in the not-too-far future when the Pacific Northwest has split into its own country. They've figured out at least one of the genes for gayness, so while still not okay with everyone, being gay is at least generally accepted. 
 In Red States, including bordering Idaho, people are poor, health services are nonexistent, gays are put into reeducation camps and marked with pink triangles, while even het sex is banned. Religion and guns rule that part of the country. 
 Sound familiar? Yep, this book was especially interesting right this moment in history. 
 A special ops group specializing in extracting gay people in danger from the Red States is hired to go in and save a special soldier. He has been modified, though right at first they don't know that. The operative they send in for the rescue is an out gay boy who has personal history with the extractee. Together, they must slog their way out of Idaho to freedom in Oregon. Along the way they meet other characters, fight off high-tech drones, and backwards militias. 
 Good story. Good premise. Nicely not black and white with the good and bad. Well-thought out and creative ideas for the future of weapons, energy, humanity. It's very easy to picture these very things coming from where we are now. The characters were well-developed and pleasingly complex, plus being appealing in their own parts. My favorite part is that the world is well-rounded in detail and a logical progression from now."
2,"Galen is a Syrena...or in other words, a merman. Not only that but he's a Prince with a brother who's about to be crowned King. Galen comes across Emma, a pale blonde haired human with violet eyes. The thing is, apparently only Syrena have violet eyes. So what exactly is Emma? Is she the lost descendant of Poseidon that they've been waiting for? 
 So Galen does what any man would do....he stalks her, becomes possessive and controlling before allowing himself to fall completely in love with her. But hang on, she HAS to mate with his brother because of some fishy power where she lets all her fishy friends get eaten by the merpeople (yeah, mean, I know...I also hate it). I thought her power would be better, or more accurately why they needed her power! it's very depressing. ""Hey you, you with the affinity of the fish. Lure them over here so I can stab them and eat them."" Ehhhh, no thank you! 
 This book could have been good but I didn't like the writing. I felt it could have been improved plus I didn't like the present tense thing going on. It definitely could have worked in past tense. Also, the lack of choice the females had over their lives was disappointing and annoying. We've seen too many controlling, possessive males like Edward Cullen and Christian Gray to let this kind of trend continue. 
 I will say that I liked the very last line.I had guessed that at the start but then as they continued investigating, I had dismissed it. It almost seemed too obvious. It's possibly the only reason I'll read the next book. If I do."
3,"A dual-narrative tale about two just-graduated high school students who find themselves attracted to one another, but who cannot quite bungle their way into actually sleeping together until the very end of the novel. The story, then, is less a romance and more a depiction of the dynamics of adolescent single-sex friendship groups among the not-very-introspective, a crowd that isn't often depicted in more serious YA fiction. I myself wasn't that fond of the characters, being more of an introspective-kind myself; they struck me as rather emotionally immature for 18 year olds, and deeply unaware of their privilege, too. But the book's snarky, and often physical, British humor definitely made it worth a read (""She was at that lively, fiery stage of drunkenness that usually comes just before vomiting or falling over, or both"" [Loc 859]; ""And, in the end, losing your virginity isn't really about you--it's about everyone else. It's about telling everyone else that you've done it so you can get on with doing it again. Properly this time"" [1476]). 
 Not sure I completely buy the ""sex-positive"" billing of the book; yes, it depicts teens hooking up and engaging in sex with partners whom they know are not their ""lobsters"" (the book's heroine, Hannah, mistakenly believes that lobsters mate for life), and there is no shaming of either young men or women for so-doing. But we don't ever really see a positive depiction of a sexual relationship, or even a tryst; since both of the book's protagonists are virgins, and they end up spending very little time together before finally overcoming embarrassment, confusion, plot twists, and adolescent fumbling, we only see them having sex once. 
 The biggest problem I had with the book was with the portrayal of Hannah's best friend, Stella, and the dynamics of Hannah's relationship with her. Perhaps because I've grown up with YA books that insist that secrets are bad, and telling the truth is the most important thing about growing up, I had a hard time with the book basically endorsing Hannah's refusal to challenge Stella about her lying and her passive-aggressive behavior towards her best friend. And Hannah's decision to lie to Stella in turn at book's end was precisely the opposite of what I would have chosen to do. So I'm not convinced that their relationship is one I would hold up as a positive model."
3,"Wait, what just happened? 
 Review coming soon"
1,"Ick. 
 Review to come at Fantasy Literature."
2,"This is my least favorite book in the series. That's sad because I was so looking forward to Bo and Astrid's story. I really like friends to lovers stories. 
 Here, Astrid is everything there is to hate about stereotypical flapper girls. She's stupid, flighty, and uses far too much slang. Her naivete is just so annoying. Astrid seems SO young in this book, but Bo stayed true to the previous books. Because of the vastly different maturity levels, their sexual relationship felt pervy. 
 However, despite not liking this book, I plan on giving Bennett's Arcadia Bell urban fantasy a chance. I did like her writing style."
5,"The Selection was like a cup pf cold delicious ice tea in a hot summer day, so sweet and you never seam to have enough! I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!! I read it from front to back in on sitting!!! 
 I loved the characters, I think there personalities were well defined! 
 There were many funny quotes that left me embarrassingly laughing with myself! 
 I think America is going to be screwed so bad in the next book OH MY GOSH I love it so much!!! 
 Definitely a Maxon fan, but I also understand Aspen persistence, but Maxon all the way, yes please! 
 When I finished the book the Acknowledgements started as ""Okay, just in case you're really busy or tired because you stayed up late finishing, I want to thank you for reading my book"", and that was so funny because I stayed up until 4 a.m. to finish reading it! Look how the author understands us all so well...and at the end she added ""some of you just saw the pretty girl on the cover of the book and decided to pick it up"" and it's so true but I loved it so much that judging by its cover got me reading it in the first place! 
 ****SPOILERS**** 
 Things I thought would have done better in the book: 
 -The selection should be more active, something like a Show your Talent, or given some tests to see witch was the most fittest for princess. 
 -I think the author could have given hints of what the rebels were looking for. 
 Never read a book in one sitting but I'm glad this one was my first! So worth it!!"
5,"In many ways, Reeve LeClaire looks like a typical twenty-two year old girl. But Ten years ago, she was kidnapped and held captive. After a lucky escape, she's spent the last six years trying to rebuild her life, a recovery thanks in large part to her indispensable therapist Dr. Ezra Lerner. But when he asks her to help another girl rescued from a similar situation, Reeve realizes she may not simply need to mentor this young victim--she may be the only one who can protect her from a cunning predator who is still out there, watching every move. 
 An excellent and addictive thriller due mostly to the accomplished portrayal of a victim in recovery - a survivor, a woman who knows her own limits and sets out to test those limits when asked to help another girl in a similar situation. Reeve is extremely likeable and very sympathetic, and so invested was I in her future that I could barely put this book down. 
 When her therapist, Dr Lerner, asks for her help she is reluctant - unsure if she is in the right headspace to be of any use and having finally managed to eek out an existance for herself that is out of the spotlight, ultimately she agrees to become a mentor for Cassie, a girl who has recently been rescued from captivity. 
 As the relationship between the two girls develops, it becomes apparent that everything is not clear cut - and that danger still lurks close by. 
 It is rare to find a thriller that is as subtle yet sophisticated as this one - the cleverly drawn relationship between Cassie and Reeve, the understated trust Reeve has with Dr Ezra Lerner, the way both she and Cassie react to the ongoing police investigation, all brilliantly compelling. Then add to that mix a truly unsettling villain, the fate of other girls still missing and some truly edge of the seat moments and you have a perfect storm. 
 Yes I loved this one. Of all the wonderful thriller and crime fiction tales I have been reading lately this one touched my heart as well as made it go boom. Highly Recommended. 
 Happy Reading Folks!"
4,"I read Storm first and I'm pleased that in this one, Michael is still Michael. 
 What did she think he was going to do, instigate an earthquake from the batting cages? Make too much grass grow on the driving range? 
 It's a turf war and both sides don't have the full story. Both sets of parents have told their children terrible things about the ""enemy"". But not everyone's a bad guy and it's not so black and white. 
 Michael is stressed out. At 17 he has so much to carry, being the only manifesting Elemental in his family. He has to make some big choices and he's very brave. This book really shows the incredible control Michael has over himself and his element. The way he can resist using it even though it means getting his ass kicked. 
 Emily and Michael are such a Romeo and Juliet. Despite the briefness of this book, I still felt for them as a couple, because they're so real and I know what happens to them. Poor Emily and poor Michael! Waaaaaaaah!!! Life can be so unfair!"
3,"Suzie and Jon can stop time when they have sex. They use this power to rob banks. 
 It's cute. Hilarious in its absurdity. Raunchy, as you might imagine - but not distasteful or overly explicit. It's worth reading this in some kind of digital edition which allows you to zoom in - every single tinily-lettered imaginary porn title/poster/...device is gloriously nonsensical! 
 Downsides: 
 - Sometimes a touch difficult to follow, given the main character's many asides to the fourth wall, wearing different outfits - but that might just be my inexperience with graphic novels as a category (or maybe Saga was just especially easy to follow). 
 - I'm not so sure the library plot is necessary. Can't these be actual criminals who rob banks for profit, rather than wishy-washy-Robin-Hood shenanigans using ill-gotten gains to save a public utility? Maybe I watch too many heist films, but I think actual criminality would have been a lot more fun."
5,"Somebody pinch me! I loved this fucking book! 
 I really wish this would have been the first Alice Clayton book I read. I made the mistake of reading Wallbanger not too long ago and not that it was bad it just didn't impress me with all the hype surrounding it. I almost wanted to steer clear of Clayton reads because of it but one of my close friends promised me I would love this. She was right. The Unidentified Redhead was witty, charming, gooey and sweet and absolutely romantic and HOT! 
 Grace Sheridan is back in Hollywood after a failed attempt at an on screen career. She's a little older now and has found her drive to succeed and follow her dreams. Staying with her friend Holly who just so happens to be an agent to top H-Wood celebs gives her a foot in the door. I have to say that Grace is my new girl crush! It's very rare that a female book character makes me fall in love with them but it happened with her. She was funny, spunky, sexy and independent. I loved watching her go after what she wanted and absolutely connected with her personal journey. She's coming off of a few years bad depression and slight weight gain after she moved away from LA but she's more determined to be happy. Her determination was a character trait I felt any woman of any age could relate to no matter where at in life you happen to be. Grace was an amazing inspiration and just adorable and lovable throughout. 
 The story was already amazing and fun but when Jack Hamilton comes onto the scene I become an ADDICT! Jack was this smoldering up and coming young actor Grace meets at one Holly's client parties. The two are immediately drawn to each other. Jack was absolutely FANTASTIC! He was the kind of guy I would totally molest in real life. Jack was very humble and down to earth even though his career was taking off being the romantic lead from a book franchise being made a movie. The thing I loved most about Jack is he wasn't some damaged alpha male jerk. He was very sweet but at the same time he could be extremely sexy. It was so funny to see how he reacted to attention from his fans. Being a hot British actor women had a tendency to throw themselves at him or become giggling idiots when he was nearby. He was amazing to Grace especially when they were out in public and she was intimidated by his attention. I really loved and appreciated that he wanted to be seen with her even if it wasn't good for his image. 
 Jack and Grace made such a great couple and I loved watching the slow progression of their courtship. They don't rush into anything and aside from their sexual attraction and fast and loose reputation associated with H-Wood they actually took time to get to know each other. They built something authentic with nights full of Golden Girls, sharing bags of chex mix and OH GOD the hot sex! The chemistry between them freaking HOT, intense and steamy. I liked knowing that they fooled around A LOT before they actually had sex, even though I'm not sure a couple in real life could wait that long but I bought it with them. These two develop a deep bond that gets stronger the more they fall for each other. Jack further proved his awesomeness when he supported Grace's career even when they faced separation because of it. I'm such a sap, I loved every second of their love story and felt the pacing of it and the timing were well plotted out. 
 Grace's friend Holly was a pleasantly hilarious addition to the story. The friendship between the two felt like a real bond between them and reminded me of my girls. On top of that, throw in the lovable gay sidekick Nick and I was in stitches! I wouldn't mind seeing a book Holly or Nick, they had so much personality between the two of them! I want Holly's story so hopefully I will see her more in the next book! 
 The Unidentified Redhead was one of the best books I have read lately. I couldn't bring myself to put it down and spent 12 hours locked in my closet to finish it. I can't think of one thing about this book that I didn't like. Even the excessive use of the word Hoo-Hah (Which should be banned from all literature IMO) didn't irk me as much. The laughter and romance had me at the author's mercy and I can't wait to see what is in store for Grace and George. (You thought his name was Jack didn't ya? Guess you have to read it to get the inside joke!) If you haven't read this book I'm telling you, you are missing a really great story! This book left me with a much needed book hangover. I haven't stopped thinking about it for days. READ IT! *whispers* Reead Itttt."
3,"Taken is a book that immediately caught my attention for several reasons: 
 1) Young adult dystopian - uh, yes please! 
 2) Pretty cover - want! 
 3) Male protagonist - YAY! Unusual - gimme! 
 So I was more than estatic when I got my happy little hands on this one. Along with that happiness was that horrible niggling feeling of worry - in a world awash with dystopians, would this be an awesomely-amazing-fabutastic read, or a bust? 
 I loved that Taken has a male protagonist, and his is the only POV. I've read very few YA dystopians with a male taking the lead the whole way through, and I really liked the different viewpoint that it gave the story. Although there is something close to insta-love AND a triangle, Grey doesn't descend into that horrible stereotypical love mode and start doing crazy stuff for the girl he's crushing on - in fact he is almost clinical in his realism of the situation, which I actually quite liked. The only downside that the insta-love-triangle had for me was that I didn't quite understand how it happened - at one moment the object of Grey's desire is seemingly pining for someone she cannot have, and the next they are joined at the hip. 
 The plot itself is intriguing, and has a fair amount of twists and turns that the characters don't see coming, but I found quite obvious - I'm not completely sure whether this is what the author was aiming for or not, but it worked for me in that wake-up-and-smell-the-coffee characters kind of way. The pace moves along pretty consistently, and I found it quite difficult to put Taken down. 
 There's no huge information dumps on the world and how it came to be this way, instead it's gradually revealed through dialogue and hints and not all the secrets are revealed in this first book, which I really liked - it has me intrigued to go back to the series and find out exactly what is happening and why, and I loved the juxtaposition of an almost utopian society in a world that has been completely changed by yet to-be-revealed events. 
 Overall I really enjoyed Taken, and it pretty much lived up to my lofty expectations. Character development is occasionally pushed aside for plot and world-building, but personally I choose those two characteristics over characters in dystopian novels.

4,"The very last story, Teddy, is amazing. De Daumier-Smith's Blue Period is quite amusing and extremely awkward. The remainder of the tales in this book left me with a feeling of melancholy. I'm still not quite certain why. It's the same sort of bit of sadness that always accompanies nostalgia. Something lost that you can never quite reacquire. 
 I used to read short stories quite frequently as a youth. I found them less committal than the daunting hardback second-hand novels that were squirreled away in cabinets and closets at home. I could read them as I pleased and not feel too guilty for skipping a boring tale or setting down the book for months at a time. In recent years, I rarely seem to come across a short story that has a happy ending. I'm not quite sure why it's easier for authors to write about sadness in brief, rather than joy, but I know now why people tend to steer clear of collections of short stories. 
 It's hard to give this book four stars when goodreads has declared four stars to equal ""really liked it"". Yes, I enjoyed the tales, but my rating lacks the enthusiasm and joy defined in those three words."
3,"It's unusual that I give 3 stars to a well-crafted novel, but I am so frustrated with Faith Hunter right now! How many freaking books in this series do we have to go through before we get ANY resolution of the Jane-Bruiser-Leo-Rick love quadrangle? Or barring resolution, how about PROGRESS? Ugh,(view spoiler)[ didn't we already do the Rick-checks-some-other-chick-out-and-Jane-loses-it thing? Why are we doing it again with Paka (hide spoiler)]? If we can't have her pick anyone, can we at least eliminate somebody? I mean FFS,(view spoiler)[ Jane's forgiven Leo, and Faith Hunter has made him likeable again. Does that mean Leo is back in the running, too (hide spoiler)]? Now we're moving BACKWARDS. I understand not wanting to blow up your series by giving your main character a premature HEA, but at book #7, SOMETHING should have happened by now. Look at the Kate Daniels series. Her love life has been rocky and full of delicious, steamy drama, but she got together with her beau by book 4. Maybe even book 3, depending on how you count. 
 As for the A-plot, Black Arts had unusually complicated vampiric skullduggery, even for a Jane Yellowrock novel. I think as an author you have to ask yourself how many times you're allowed to re-explain the plot to the reader before you give up and start simplifying. Even with a complete summation of everyone's nefarious motives and actions at the 99% mark, I was still scratching my head. I can't exactly say there were plot holes, but only because the whole thing was so baroque and confusing I'll never be able to SEE the plot holes. 
 Of course the characters are still wonderfully written and three-dimensional, and the pacing was excellent. It was a well-written novel, no doubt about that. I'm just so tired of some of these themes, though. Why is Jane still so guilt-obsessed when the rest of us are so over it already? And (view spoiler)[I'm happy things between Big Evan and Molly seem to have improved, really I am, but they're no Jane-[insert male here] substitute (hide spoiler)]. And whoopdedoo, Leo et al. (view spoiler)[fought off another challenger to the throne (hide spoiler)] yet again, and I'm supposed to care or be at all apprehensive about the (view spoiler)[European vamps showing up in (hide spoiler)] the next book? 
 I'm just... so.... TIRED."
3,"3.5/5 I liked it, but I didn't love it."
3,"Very short novella only 70 pgs that shows the meeting and connection between Laura and Javier. It also ends with her abduction on live TV by terrorist. This is a precursor to their book. Which I am eager to read. 
 Little to small for me to give a higher rating. Hope for more character developing in their full book."
3,"Lizzie is unhappy with the restrictions placed on her as a young lady in 1900s San Francisco. She doesn't like attending Mrs. Barstow's and would rather go with her doctor father as he sees patients. Then when her father is away, Jing, their servant, gets caught in the quarantine of Chinatown because of rumors of plague. Lizzie is determined to find him and get him out because his son Noah is hiding out at their house. Jing didn't want Noah to get caught in the quarantine, but no one even knows Jing has a son. Lizzie tries to get her aunt and uncle and older brother to help her on her quest, but nothing seems to work. 
 Lizzie friendship with Noah also opens her mind to the possibility of making friends at Mrs. Barstow's. She becomes friends with Gemma and learns that not all the girls are as bad as she thought they were. Gemma's brother Gus also starts taking an interest in her and helps her on her quest. 
 I have enjoyed Choldenko's books in the past and this one is just as interesting. She does a great job researching the history of the events she writes about. I do almost wish there was a bit more information about the plague, but Lizzie wouldn't have had all that much more information so it makes since that the reader doesn't. I liked Lizzie's spunk and the fact that she wanted to be more than just a lady looking for a husband. I also liked the relationships in the book. Lizzie's friendships with Noah, Gemma and Gus all seemed very real. I also enjoyed how her relationship with her aunt developed throughout the story. 
 I received a copy of this book from Netgalley."
5,"I really liked this book! I love vampires and romance! Abigail Gibbs did a good job of weaving all these characters and plots together, rarely a dull moment."

0,"Sadly, I've renewed this three times & will have to return it soon, so I will have to come back to it. The prose is so beautiful and the story is just--perfect and astounding."
5,"In the Band by Jean Haus has definitely taken its spot on my list of favorite New Adult novels. A story about a girl joining a band full of hot guys, especially the hot but frustrating guitar player Romeo? Yeah. Who doesn't want to read about that? 
 More times than not, in books like this one, I end up disliking the main character within the first few pages. For some reason, they always seem like the same down-and-out, sarcastic, defensive girl who can't let anyone get close to her. That is so not the case with Riley. She's real, low key, honest and funny. And I connected to her immediately. 
 Riley feels guilt about her family's problems, things that have nothing to do with her. She cooks, cleans, takes care of her sister, all while her mother sinks further into depression. And Riley is the one who is left feeling guilty for wanting to ""waste time"" in a band or with a boy. I felt such sympathy for Riley, I felt an understanding for why she felt the way she did, but I also had some frustration because Riley was the only member of her family to act like an adult and step up to the plate, even though none of it was her fault or problem. I kept wishing she'd realize that everyone else needed to deal with there own issues and just give everyone the finger and ditch out on them all. But, of course, Riley being the loving, caring daughter that she is would never do something like that. 
 Then there's the guitar god known as Romeo. I'm telling you, this book is a swoon-fest and it's all Romeo's fault. This boy definitely lives up to his name. The heat between him and Riley sizzles right off the page. Sure, Romeo's character seems like a bit of wish fulfillment, but he is still slightly flawed (in a way that makes him even more attractive). Basically, he reminds me a lot of Lucas from Easy. And I know many of you love Lucas from Easy just as much as I do. And there's even a little extra at the end of the book, a pivotal scene in Romeo's POV, that gives the reader a nice little look inside his head. 
 In the Band is a mature YA/New Adult novel and, due to a little sexual content, is not recommended for younger readers. But, it it's a steamy romance in the same vein as Easy you're after, then In the Band is the book for you!"
5,"THIS IS SO GOOD GO READ IT NOW. 
 ........................................... 
 Okay, as Caitlin points out, maybe don't read it now unless you enjoy the blissful torture that is waiting for publication of sequels. (What can I say? I grew up during Harry Potter.) There will be three books in this storyline, and I plan to gobble them all up. 
 But it any event, do read it sometime, because this novel was divine. The writing is phenomenal, the characters fantastical, the romantic tension actually palatable (not a given, in YA)... the whole thing is stunning. This is another one that simply refused to be put down - and that's including the slow burn reveal and flashback towards the end. 
 Fair warning to the faint of heart - this book is intense. (Definitely gets a rating of YA+.) It squarely faces some very serious themes of life and death and love and war, though it isn't a big pile of grimdark and sadfeels. There's much beauty to be found amidst the smoke."
3,"I think a large part of my problem with this book was world-building. Which is funny, because it's set in 21st century America, and generally I don't think about world-building in such books. The problem is, this book sets up an institution - Themis Academy - and a large part of the plot of the book revolves around criticizing that institution, but there's no particular rhyme or reason for why the institution is the way it is. 
 Themis Academy is a super-prestigious boarding school whose students are all ""insanely driven"" (the book's words, not mine) about their academic/sports/career interests. The main character is a piano player who wants to go to Julliard who lives with a future lawyer and a soccer player. The soccer player is dating a wannabe hand surgeon (HAND SURGEON. They're like, 17) who rooms with a science geek (possibly a future ornithologist, but he also likes physics). You get the picture. This isn't really the unbelievable part of Themis - the author does an okay job of showing the strength of their interests - but it sets up the rest, supposedly. 
 Themis Academy is a super-prestigious boarding school for high schoolers that believes its high-achieving students can do no wrong. Teenagers. At a boarding school. Can do no wrong. What? This is constantly emphasized, and we even see it at work. The main character knees a boy in the balls in class and the principal responds with hand-wringing and ""there must be a logical explanation."" The main character says they were just getting really into acting out their scene - an attempted rape scene from an adaptation of the Tempest - and neither she nor the guy she hit (who was also ""way too into acting out the scene"" aka actually being a huge creep, which prompted the kneeing) gets in trouble. The teacher gets probation for allowing the scene to happen, which, to be fair, she maybe should not have assigned that scene. Another example of Themis reactions to bad things: before the main character came, a student killed herself, and they added information on warning signs of suicide to their Diversity Day presentations. 
 While I can accept the idea of a school that looks the other way and allows bullying, and worse, to flourish, Themis goes beyond that into total la-la land. The worst punishment most students get is losing points for off-campus privileges; the main character is astonished that suspension is even an option. This is a co-ed boarding school where minors are apparently allowed to get into the rooms of members of the opposite sex with no barriers - if there's an easily-skirted system, it's not even mentioned, they just go up to people's rooms. Okay. I mean, I've never been to boarding school, but I can't see that being a thing anywhere. There's no ideology behind the lax discipline, either, that I can tell. Themis just believes its students are Above All That because they're talented. In an author's note at the end, the author says that the book was inspired by her own experiences at Brown University, before there was a system for dealing with date-rape on campus and while that system was being established. Looking at it that way? This book would have made much more sense in a college setting. Legal adults at college are allowed to make their own decisions in a way that I can't see happening in a boarding high school. 
 There's also this weird dynamic that apparently plays into the Themis exceptionalism where the teachers like to have their students perform for them. Like, not for the public, but performances specifically for the faculty. There are, obviously, also public things - sports matches, the main character's performance for her spring project - but those are barely mentioned, while the students talk about the private performances for faculty members a lot. The thing is, I'm not really sure why this is there or how it informs the way Themis is structured. The best explanation seems to be that the teachers are obsessed with their students, an observation I think the main character makes. But there's no real explanation for why these private performances, how they sell it to parents - it feels vaguely exploitative, but I can't figure out why it's happening. 
 Themis is inward-focused, obsessively so. The students know everything about most of the teachers' lives, or at least think they do. The teachers have their private performances, their weird anxious oversight of the students, their insistence that every one is special. (For a non-curricular example, students get cakes sent to their common rooms on their birthdays every year, a situation that apparently leads to a cake in every common room basically every night). Is it that the teachers are so enamored with their students they can't take that critical step back to correct them? That seems a strange stance to allow teachers to take, since that's a large part of their purpose, especially at a boarding school where they're the only authority figures around. It's not a classism thing, a fear of angry rich parents or a good-old-boys thing - no one really even mentions money in this book. There's no real motive, unless the motive is to just enjoy the students' performance in class and in the private faculty shows. It's just neglect, at a school that is full of privileged kids and obviously not lacking in resources to support them in other ways. I think Themis ignoring the indiscretions of its students would have made more sense if Themis was more outward-focused, instead of inward-focused. If it was about upholding the prestige of the school and its students to the world, protecting their no-doubt stellar future careers, not wanting to offend the families who support the school with their charitable gifts - that, I could understand. Or even if the book said anything particularly apt about gender dynamics and the he-said/she-said defense Carter tries at the Mockingbirds' trial. Instead of engaging meaningfully with real world issues, the book spends a lot of time criticizing a problem created to support its central premise that doesn't make any goddamn sense outside of that. Because it never really gets to what feels like the root of the problem, most of the criticism, both flippant/traditional and angry, that the protagonist aims at the school falls flat. 
 The place where it hit hardest was the scene in the principal's office after the main character knees a boy in her English class in the balls. They've been acting out a scene from her modern adaptation of The Tempest (the ""random"" assignment of that play to her is another choice that is transparently meant to drive the plot forward, almost self-consciously labeled as ""not random"" by the protagonist). The scene in question is the attempted rape of Miranda by Caliban; Miranda repulses him by kicking him. The boy she acts it out with (another random assignment) also happens to hate her because he's friends with the boy she has accused of date rape. He goes off-script and whispers nasty things to her, then actually acts out the violent grabbing in the scene, with much more force than is obvious to the people watching. The main character, feeling threatened, responds by kneeing him in the balls. Afterwards, the principal dances around the issue - the protagonist's apparently unprovoked assault on another student - and the sense of helplessness and anger when the principal obviously thinks the protagonist is in the wrong is kind of affecting. But again, it's all revolving around the teachers obviously not wanting to believe anyone is anything other than a perfect angel. They laugh it off when both the protagonist and the boy pretend that they were just really invested in acting, because of course Themis supports getting really invested in assignments even when they're ill-advised assignments. 
 It's just...so weird. That's the only way I can describe the world-building. Weird. I found myself grasping for explanations for why the author would make the choices she did, but honestly, I think it comes down to this: she wanted the Mockingbirds. The Mockingbirds are a group of students who created and enforce their own code of conduct, without the teachers' knowledge, to make sure kids who are hurt by other kids at Themis get justice. It's democratic, by the students, for the students, and the protagonist likes to marvel at the ""checks and balances"" built into the system. Neglectful authority gave the Mockingbirds a reason for existing. It's just that the set-up is not convincing enough to make the result - the Mockingbirds - particularly intriguing. It makes me mad because there are some really interesting ideas. The most interesting is the fact that one branch of the Mockingbirds is the ""runners"" - kids who take the attendance sheets to the office, where they are used to tally up attendance points, which are then redeemed for off-campus privileges. These runners occasionally use this in to change the amount of attendance points of people the Mockingbirds are investigating. This could be totally cool. The council and mock trials are kind of cool, too, especially the secret selection of three out of the nine to judge the trials, to avoid people trying to convince the judges before the trial. I never quite got what the board is for exactly, but it seems to be the leadership. Maybe if I pick up the next book (I might) I'll see how the board works. It's less a checks-and-balances system of branches, though, than a progression of ""grassroots"" to authority - the runners are on the ground, the council do all the trial stuff, and the board runs things. It's just frustrating that these all came to being in such a vague setting. There could be some really cool criticism and subversion going on - I'm imagining the Mockingbirds in a suffocating place like Neptune in Veronica Mars - but instead the execution just left me kind of going ""meh."" 
 I do think the protagonist's personal growth and story is nice, but I don't have clear enough thoughts on it to comment. Again, I didn't really feel too much of the emotional connection, but that might be that the suspension of disbelief issues in the book as a whole were getting in the way. Her love of music was a good anchor point for her character, especially Ode to Joy, and the way her relationship to it changed over the book as she came to terms with her rape - it was always her favorite piece of music, but because she talked about it with the boy who raped her and he played it for her just before, it brought up too many bad memories for a while. I was never quite sure what was going on with her love of dead composers - she mentioned them early on as almost personalities in her head, and she was apparently ""fighting with Beethoven"" during her trouble with Ode to Joy, but that never panned out particularly well. I found myself following the protagonist's personal journey with vague interest, and forcing myself to keep reading through the Mockingbird/criticism of Themis bits while trying to figure out wtf was going on with the portrayal of them. 
 Random little niggly peeve: I'm not sure why it was ""date rape"" and not just ""rape""? Maybe I've never quite got why there's a distinction anyway, but Carter wasn't exactly someone she trusted. She never even talked to him in a friendly manner before they met at a function they came to with different groups and she got super drunk. I think it would've been fine if it hadn't been used quite so much in ways that started to feel a little unnatural - as a verb, for example. ""He date raped her"" just seems weird. But then again, I can see where it might help to distinguish from violent rape to talk about the protagonist's feelings of doubt and shame. The treatment of rape in the book just started to feel oddly un-nuanced after a while, which is probably a way I could describe most of the things the author tried to do in this book. There were some interesting elements to this story, but mostly the execution was trying to do too many things and not doing them terribly well."
3,"I was able to read an Advance copy of this one. 
 And the entire time I was reading it, I was comparing it to both 'Princess Academy' by Shannon Hale and 'The Selection' series, by Kiera Cass. So, if you loved those, then this one is probably right up your alley! 
 Otherwise-- I liked the strong women characters and the interesting 'new' religions created for this book. 
 I'm not sure that I agree with the 12+ completely, though-- so, if you have a kiddo in that range you may want to check it out first. Depending on your views on sex, you may want to know that there are characters that engage in it in this book-- and you know it-- but it doesn't go on and on about it."
5,"LOVE this series. It makes me think of the future and of what is to come. Cloe was a bit annoying throughout the book at times, hopefully she will grow up a little and stop being so whiny."
4,BOOK 4 only 2800 pages left of the seriessssss let's do this Revolutionary War!
3,"I went into this with rather low expectations and, honestly, it read like fan-fiction. Not necessarily bad fan-fiction, but fan-fiction nonetheless. At times it felt honestly ridiculous and I probably won't be re-reading it. 
 I wish we could get some more content from the Harry Potter universe that we actually want. No-one really wanted the Fantastic Beasts movie nor a story about Harry's child. What we really want is the Marauders and McGonagall and Dumbledore. I would love a book about Dumbledore and Grindelwald, including the final battle between the two. I'd love to even read about the first Wizarding War with the original Order of the Phoenix. But instead we get a movie based on one of Harry's textbooks and a fan-fiction/play about a character who is briefly mentioned in the last two pages of the Deathly Hallows."
3,To be perfectly honest this is probably my least favorite of the series so far.
4,"I don't know if I should really start with this, but I'm just going to say it anyway. I am always very intrigued by male authors who write in the romance genre. I don't mean to stereotype in any way, but I have tried to read quite a few books written by male authors and have not finished them. It seems that many are quite brash and forget to add the actual 'romance' element into their stories. Yes, I know that sex sells, but at the same time, I feel there needs to be a balance. 
 That being said, J.D. Hawkins really delivered with Cocky Chef! This is my first read by him, and I have to admit that I am truly impressed. His descriptive writing completely brought the characters, setting, foods, and flavors to life. It was a sweet and lighthearted romance with the perfect balance of passion and a great story! 
 Cole and Willow absolutely fit their cooking roles to a 'T'. I know how chefs can be quite the conundrum and very hard to please. They tend to be very complex, with their creative minds, usually determined in their drive for success, yet they can be very emotional, hot headed, and insecure. Cole and Willow definitely encompassed all of these characteristics, which made their challenges within themselves throughout the story very believable. Cole and Willow seriously made food sexy! Their irresistible passion for foods and flavors just rolled into this steamy build of passion between them throughout, and the ending of the story was so sweet and romantic! 
 J.D. Hawkins really has a true talent in his descriptive writing and conveyed it so well in this story! His detailed descriptions of the restaurant environment, staff, and behaviors were spot on. The smells and flavors with the foods, the ingredients of the recipes, and the tastes on the palate were all so vivid to me. It really brought me into the story, and allowed my imagination to feel as if I was experiencing them all myself. The passion that Hawkins created in the story between the characters and the foods gave the story even more life. 
 So, color me impressed! Cocky Chef was a quick, fun, and sexy read and totally hit the mark for me. I definitely recommend checking this romance out and look forward to reading more from J.D. Hawkins! 
 *** 4.5 Stars for me! ***

4,"LEAGUE OF STRAYS was a quite interesting book with a deep mystery ready to be unlocked. I loved the characters and the settings written throughout the book, making this book what it is now. Especially the main protagonist of the book, Charlotte with the rest of her friends and members from the LEAGUE OF STRAYS: Nora, Kade, Richie and Zoe. 
 THE MEMBERS OF THE LEAGUE OF STRAYS: 
 CHARLOTTE; quiet and different was a character who I loved from the start. Rebelling parents and fighting and crying for her causes, she was a character perfectly made, I say ""Charlotte is a fun character I've read about in a long time."" 
 KADE; strange and mysterious is a young man who is like a modern day Dr Jekyll and My Hyde. To me, he had type of innocence yet he also had that craziness in the way he talked and his actions showed but in the beginning he was like every other average guy until we start revealing the missing pieces of his life. 
 NORA; smart and lost. She is an incredibly smart girl who was bullied by her teacher with the help of the LEAGUE OF STRAYS there were some misdoings and adventure, she's pretty smart with her use of words and language, a typical brain power. 
 RICHIE; loyal and follower, he's like a second partner in crime or side-kick. He's bestfriends with Kade which makes them a strange pair eventhough he got bullied for a long year, kicked in the butt and got suspended for bringing drugs to school, I think he was someone who needed someone else to follow after; someone like Kade... 
 ZOE; kick-ass and hard-hearted. I liked this character with her fiery actions and her liveliness to all the characters included. She added that something that pulled everyone together and through the years of being bullied, she still stood tall and fought her way through, someone you could trust and someone you could fight side by side with. 
 Final Summary: Mysterious, on-the-go and heart-thumping, League of Strays was entirely compulsive and brave. It was simply brilliant as I read the start till the end! 
 Thanks to NetGalley! 
 You can also find this on my blog!"
5,Loved this conclusion to the series.
5,These two books were simply amazing! I loved Dark Reunion the best.
4,"This installment centers on the attempt by Laia and Elias to free Laia's brother from prison and Blood Shrike Helene's attempt to capture Elias, told in their three POV's. The beautiful writing and emotion are just as evident as in book 1, as is the love quartet (though Helene clearly acknowledges that anything she and Elias had is behind them). 
 The main weakness, which drew me out of the story a little, is in the heightening of the romantic interest between Laia and Keenen, not that multiple love interests bother me too much. The problem was the fact that Laia becomes very weak and passive as that aspect of the plot plays out (view spoiler)[to the point where I was scratching my head as to how she could sleep with Keenen when she obviously has feelings for Elias. She's just not that cheap or weak, so I really wanted to shake her, except I realized that making her become weak was part of the plot development with the Nightbringer. (hide spoiler)] That whole thing just felt wrong, very untrue to Laia's character, and more of a character behaving a certain way to forward the plot than organic character change. The bulk of the plot twist about Laia's love interests would have been unaffected by not deepening that love triangle, (view spoiler)[but keeping Keenen more interested in Laia than she was in him and allowing it to be a betrayal of friendship (hide spoiler)]. 
 Still, I very much enjoyed the story and how the storylines surrounding Helene and Elias's problems in this book resolved. Almost a 5 star."
4,"I am really enjoying these books. I like the action as well as the philosophical ideas being interspersed and used as motivation for the story and characters. And not in a bad way, but in a really human and believable way. The TechnoCore is fascinating, but not as much as the Lions and Tigers and Bears. 
 Can't wait to see where this goes."
1,"Wow. That was terrible. 
 Which is too bad, because there are some interesting ideas here: a near future America ruled by Fundamentalist Christians in which abortion has been criminalized and criminals are punished by having their skin color changed to a tell-tale crayon box color. Hannah Payne, having had an abortion after getting knocked up by a powerful religious figure, is now red. Great hook, and the first fifty or so pages of the book are interesting enough. 
 Unfortunately, once Hannah is released from prison, Jordan's ideas get lost in the muddle of an unwieldy and tedious story. Plot lines are added and dropped at random, and none of them are really cogent or cohesive. As Hannah ping-pongs from one unbelievable situation to another, it becomes clear that she is probably among the shallowest literary characters of all time, showing no integrity, no intelligence, no reasonable motivation at any point. She is only consistent in one way, and that is that her behavior makes no sense after her release. I can buy the affair that starts everything, unromantic though it may be, but (view spoiler)[ it's hard for me to believe that after a scant thirty days in prison, an uneducated Evangelical who thinks feminists are evil and homosexuals an abomination would join a pro-choice ""terrorist group"" and start getting it on with a woman. (hide spoiler)] Meanwhile, character after character tells Hannah how smart and amazing and perceptive and beautiful and brave she is, while she flops around idiotically like Bella freaking Swan, and is there anything that makes me less attracted to a character than that kind of unfounded character worship? No, there is not. 
 The writing didn't do much for me, either, and I say this having liked Mudbound and the way it was written very much. In all, a real disappointment. Should have been a short story. Or better organized. Or a lot better edited. Any of those things."
2,Tried listening to this but every time I turned it on I would end up tuning it out and my mind would wander. So I stopped listening to it.
5,"I love everything Brian K. Vaughan has written and Saga is no exception. It's a space opera but also a look at a marriage between two alien species in a far flung galaxy, where both magic and science exist. It is like no space opera you have ever seen. Forget Star Wars, this is a look at a galaxy where people talk and act like us, where sex and violence are portrayed, but best of all, with lots of humor. The dialogue between the two main characters, Marko and Alana, sound like the typical banter of any young married couple. Because they are from warring factions, their marriage is forbidden under both cultures and their leaders send out hit squads to eliminate them. They are all the run, literally seconds after the birth of their daughter. This novel nicely sets up the premise for what promises to be a long running and entertaining series."
5,"This first installment is oh so much richer than I thought. The world building alone is fantastic; it really draws you in and places you front and center. 
 And now, of course, I cannot wait to find out what happens to all of them. I have an inkling on who the young man is, but... next book coming right up."
3,"AHHH, I managed to finish it with one hour left on my ARC download. Shew, that was down to the wire! 
 A cute, light-hearted LBGT romance book with lots of Armenian culture. Review soon!"
4,Great series - this one adds to the back story.
4,"Jill Parnell had worked her butt off in Gray, Corbett & Shaw Law firm for five years, and the day she thought she'd be promoted to Managing Attorney turned out to be false alarm. That position she had aspired for was given to one of the partners' relative and that really hurt workaholic Jill.. Concerned friends told her to take it easy and have fun once in a while, but how could she, after her ill-fated career boost? 
 Ryan Shaw met Jill on a common friend's wedding and they hit it off. Another promising job got Jill all excited that she was willing to hire a ten-minute boyfriend just to impress a possible new colleague. After she realized who Ryan was, she needed a plan to put into action, and she'd do everything to make it happen. 
 I'd like to call this story, It Started With A Kiss, because that's how I saw Jill and Ryan's partnership started. But after reading the entirety of this lawyer romance, Driven to Date is indeed the deserving title. I loved how Jill had pursued her plans and showed so much drive to achieve her goals, by changing the person she initially was. I liked that she was open to criticisms and listened to pieces of advice even if it tore her heart. Ryan Shaw was the ideal man, despite getting called a player or someone with a short attention span for ladies. He had proven that there was more to him than meets the eye, and he always got me with his buttercup charisma. 
 Susan Hatler, as always, make the readers swoon and feel in love with her stories and characters. I loved that this one has clean, slowly burning romance that got me giddy like a teen. Jill and Ryan may have driven me crazy with their complicated love affair, but I was more than happy to plead guilty for being crazy in love."
4,"If I'd ever had reason to consider the notion, I'd have been willing to bet that if I walked into a room that held a dead body, the body would have been the first thing I noticed. 
 Georgia and her daughter Madison have moved into her parent's house while they are on a sabbatical. Georgia has landed an adjunct teaching position at the college where her parents have tenure. Her childhood home also has Sid the skeleton in residence. Sid has been with the family since Georgia was 6 years old. A weekend outing with Sid in costume starts a series of events that lead to the story of his demise. 
 This is a cute, humorous book that does not take itself too seriously. Sid has a plethora of bad jokes up his sleeve in his repertoire, a cocky attitude and a strong sense of protection toward Georgia. I enjoyed the characters and look forward to reading more in the series."
5,"Holy shit, that was hot. ..."
4,"Not as good as The Adoration of Jenna Fox - it's hard to beat that - but still a solid sequel. Characterization was shaky. Dot, however, was fantastic, and I LOVE Miesha. I can't wait to read Fox Forever."
4,"This book was a challenge to me. I wasn't really into the story, and even when I was hooked and really interested, I kept pushing the book aside and reading other things. Maybe I was just stressed with work or something. 
 When I did read it, I fell in love with the world Marie Lu created. Dystopian civilizations are fascinating, but for the first time this book centers in just one country, and its own problems. I loved the idea of an inner war, an inner rebellion and of both sides being thecnically one. 
 Day to me, is truly a Legend. Especially because he's not trying to be famous, be a statement or moving someone. He's trying to survive and help his family, to help his city. He's a hero. He's cocky and a charmer, funny and brave. 
 June is the Republic's darling. Highest score on the Trial's ever, sharp mind and incredible physical abilities. She was a really complex character, and it was awesome to read her struggle when a harsh moment came around. 
 This book was incredible, and I'm not wasting a moment before starting Prodigy. 
 Quote: ""Each day means a new twenty-four hours. Each day means everything's possible again. You live in the moment, you die in the moment, you take it all one day at a time. You try to walk in the light""."
3,"Some were really good. Others, not so much. Ellen Hopkins basically ripped off the Snow Queen story from HCA--- if she tried to turn that in to a school she would have been expelled for plagiarism; it was that close. But other than that, not bad :)"
3,I cant decide if i like this series or not. Argh
0,Shelved it. Not into zombies and dystopia this month.
5,After attempting to read this book all year I finally did it! Not to say it was a bad book or that it's a difficult read I just have the belief that sometimes you are not ready to read certain books. This time I was and I was glad I did. If you like steampunk you will enjoy it with this unique Japanese twist. I can't wait to read the next two books.
2,"John Scalzi wrote this book as practice to become a novelist, and it shows. There are glimmers of his future brilliance and everything I loved about Redshirts, but this novel is really, really rough. The characters all have roughly the same personality. The aliens are bizarrely casual and blase and far too human. The solution to the problem of introducing the aliens to humanity is preposterous and ridiculous (We're body snatchers! We stole this poor woman's body and inhabited her for over a year! Let's all be friends! Except you, North Korea. No one likes you). The conclusion is way too drawn out. 
 So no, this book didn't work so well for me. I definitely see the potential, and John Scalzi has grown so much as a writer since he first wrote this book. He's capable of much better."
4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 3.5-4 stars 
 An enjoyable read. I loved Graham! He was adorable, when he wasn't being a prick. Still, he was hard to resist despite that. I liked Soraya.... in the beginning. She was fun, refreshing and cool. Until she wasn't. I didn't like the way she handled an incident. She deliberately did something to hurt Graham in the cruelest way possible and it just wasn't cool. It wasn't right, at all. She did try to make up for it. Thank goodness, she had the smartest guy who managed to figure things out. This dampened things for me a bit. It's a good thing all's well that's ends well .... Somehow. 
 Loved the epilogue! It was a saving grace, for me."
4,"I liked this book. This was one of the times I wished I hadn't read the reviews, as many of them were pretty negative. I know it's not a perfect book, but it was a good story - and an interesting take on the whole Salem Witch Trial story."
5,"I was right to retain such a strong opinion of Snicket. These books were very important to my childhood and it's still brilliant. His style is so unique, clever and likeable. His stories and characters are gripping and original. This book is a great start to one of the best children's series ever. 
 Re-reading this book as an adult, and the whole series, is so very rewarding, because you pick up on lots of references you didn't get as a kid, and can appreciate its messages so much after you've been through growing up and everything life throws at you."
0,"Aww, this was adorable, of course! The progression of Autumn and Dax's relationship is believable because they don't hate each other at first; they are just working off of what they've heard and what they perceive. But then they get to know each other, the friendship develops, and then the romantic chemistry becomes harder and harder to dismiss...

4,"This latest juvenile fiction novel by Jessisa Day George was incredibly fun and creative! 
 The Glower Castle builds new rooms, turrets, and even wings, on Tuesdays. Celie, the youngest princess, maps the changes out and seems to have a bond with the castle. When her parents and older brother are deemed dead, the crown prince, Celie, and her older sister do what they can to keep the Castle and kingdom from evil clutches. Celie is a very mature 11 year old and is quick-thinking. 
 I thought it was a quick, entertaining, clean, and fun story."
1,"NO NO NO NO NO NO NO. Did I mention no? ""You HAVE to read Twilight"" they said. ""Twilight is the best book ever"" they said. I admit, I am a total bandwagon jumper when it comes to what's ""hot"" at the time. It is how I read the Harry Potter series(effing awesome!) and the Fifty Shades series(pretty good) but what can I say about this series? It blew. That's what I can say. I stuck it out because all my friends and family that have read it kept PROMISING me that it gets better! Well I kept reading and kept reading and do you know what I found? It never got better :/ What a colossal waste of my time. It took me MONTHS to get through these books! I'm sorry, twi-hards. I just didn't see the appeal. I gave it a shot at least. So that's that. Moving on...."
1,"After the ""Farseer"" trilogy, I made the mistake of trying to read Robin Hobb's SHIP OF MAGIC, and I'm hard pressed to come up with a more annoying protagonist. I somehow managed to labor through this, but lost all interest in reading anything by Hobb. Even the wonderful ""Farseer"" books couldn't salvage my former zeal for this writer. It's been almost 10 years though, and a copy of SHAMAN'S CROSSING sits unread on my shelf, gathering dust. At some point I'll pick it up, I think, and hopefully renew a lost love affair. Hopefully, hopefully."
1,"A couple things: Gemma, Max, Carter and Addison sound like a group of toddlers who possibly attend my kids' daycare, not 16 year olds. Also, cover fail: that guy does not look Japanese. P.S. Fuck Gemma and Addison for that ""What's the difference?"" bullshit."
2,"I received a copy from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. 
 Edie and her mother have been running for years. Though this isn't made explicitly clear until more than halfway through the book, it's implied that they are in hiding from Edie's abusive father. He works for the police as a psychologist, and it's unclear as to whether or not Edie and her mother ever tried to get a restraining order or help from professionals, but Edie seems to have a very clear distrust of people in positions of authority. This could be perhaps because her father is technically in a position of authority, or because similar people didn't help them in their time of need. It's a little annoying how little we know about the situation. 
 Since You've Been Gone is not a long read, which is a disadvantage, because the plot deserves more than what it was given, and so did most of the supporting characters, all of whom seemed ten times more interesting than main character Edie, who is written extremely inconsistently. Everything feels rushed - Edie's search for her missing mother, the result of which is anticlimactic, and Edie's romance with Jermaine. On the plus side, since it isn't that long, it doesn't take you that long to get through it. To be honest, I almost stopped reading a couple of times, but since it was such a quick read I figured I might as well power through it. 
 Edie was not a very likeable main character. That's not always necessary when having a protagonist, but I get the feeling we were supposed to like her, and I just didn't. She was introduced as a fiery spitball who would punch anyone who looked at her sideways, but as the story progressed she became more and more cowed, shying away from everyone. She steals money from a charity and spends it mostly on takeout instead of more suitable staples - and she allows Jermaine to take the fall for the theft. (What she does later in no way negates what she did. That was a dick move, Edie.) Her romance with Jermaine is ridiculous, and there are many times during her search for her mother where she seems to not care about her missing mother at all because she's too focused on the cute boy that she's with. Also, I'm sorry, but when you're 15 and your mother hasn't been home for two days, you go to the damn police. 
 The plot felt wonky. Since You've Been Gone is as much about Edie's relationship with Jermaine as it is her relationship with her mother, and that's just weird. I don't feel that we got to see enough of Edie with her mother to really care that she disappeared (as terrible as that is to say), but I think a lot of that is the fact that this book is so short. There was really a lot more that author Mary Jennifer Payne could have done to expand the universe and explore the plot a little more."

 I have read Lauren Layne's previous works and I have liked them but this book?! I loved it! I LOVE the best-friends-to-lovers trope. I always have high expectations for this trope and this book did not disappoint. Parker and Ben have been the best of friends since their freshman year in college. After six years, they are still best friends, living together and they don't have feelings towards one another. Parker is somewhat happy in her relationship with her boyfriend and Ben is happily flirting and hooking up. But then Parker's boyfriend dumps her because he needs a break and Parker starts to consider having no strings attached sex with whoever. But she realizes she wants to have fun with sex and the only way to do that is to hook up with someone she knows, someone she trusts, someone who will not make it awkward once they have done the deed. All of the arrows point to Ben. 
 What if the right guy to scratch my sexual itch is the one who makes me laugh? The one I can talk to. 
 What if the right guy . . . 
 Has been right in front of me?* 
 The friendship between Parker and Ben, even after six years, is so intact and loyal. They have such witty banter that will have you smiling and laughing, too. But they also have their serious talks. They seek each other for advice, for a shoulder to cry on, just what every best friend would do. Ben has stayed by Parker's side in one of the most earth-shattering experiences of her life and Parker has given Ben a friend and a family. This pair has gone through so much together. A pair like this will obviously soon start having feelings towards one another and sparks will fly like you have never seen before. 
 Ben and my no strings attached relationship? Yeah. Turns out that there are suddenly strings after all. And I'm completely tangled in them.* 
 The chemistry between them is out of this world. The sex scenes were steamy as hell. I was at work reading and had to look over my shoulder, just in case. I loved the sex scenes because they were really fun. I mean, they were hot of course but because Ben and Parker have been friends for years, the sex was very comfortable between them and funny, at times. Parker would crack me up with some of her excuses. It really was something that I think everyone would want to have with their partner--to have fun, have intimacy and be comfortable all at the same time. 
 I have to admit I was surprised by the characters in this story. You know how the male is almost always very sure of himself and what he wants. Well, Ben is kind of the opposite. Even though he's smart, he doesn't see his achievements--he actually tries to downplay them because he thinks he didn't do a good job or tries to justify his achievements. His family wanted him to become a lawyer but he chose his own path. Since then, his family hasn't been supportive and he has been on his own until Parker arrived. Ben really struggles with his self-esteem and it was nice to read about his character and completely see his vulnerable side, even though he is a total man-whore. 
 Parker's family is very tight and they have received Ben with open arms since he was introduced. I loved reading about Ben's relationship with Parker's mom and dad. It wasn't much but what the author wrote was enough to make my heart melt and feel happy that Ben could at least have a family in Parker's parents. The other character I really loved but at the same time would have my hate moments was Lori, who's Parker best friend and coworker. I have to admit that she was a good friend to Parker but she really had a major crush on Ben and that put me off for a while and I felt bad for her but at the same time, I hated that she had her sights on him. In the end, I ended up liking her again so all is good. 
 I highly recommend this book to everyone who is looking for a refreshing and funny New Adult story. This is one that could probably leave you wanting more like it happened with me.

 Exquisite. A near perfect blend of fantasy, action, adventure and magic. Finely imagined and beautifully told, Songs of The Earth by Elspeth Cooper is one greatly enjoyable and entirely captivating debut fantasy novel. I had a wonderful time reading it. Thanks to Cooper's excellent and engaging storytelling, it didn't take long for me to become totally immersed in the plot. All the characters were carefully depicted, with a mixture of qualities and flaws that really made them jump off the page. The settings were vivid and painted with an exceptional care for details. I could almost feel the cold wind on my skin and hear the glorious song of power and magic. And it felt amazing. And it made me crave more. Mesmerizing - that would be the word. But also adventurous, at times scary and disquieting, thematically poignant, moving, even slightly philosophical. Beautiful. It was, in every sense of the word, an epic story and an exciting beginning to a promising new series. 
 Suffer ye not the life of a witch and shun ye all works of evil lest they imperil thy soul. 
 Gair can hear the Song. Which basically means he is a witch. He can touch the songs of the earth and weave magic. Unfortunately, the world he's been born into is a cold and unforgiving one, where practicing magic equals besmirching the sanctity of the Suvaeon Order and is punishable by death. And no one cares about Gair's loyalty to the Lady and his many years of service to the Church. All that matters is that he has performed acts of witchcraft for which he must be punished. Burned. While Gair is doing his best to stay alive, the magic inside him is breaking free and he has to do something with it, has to learn how to embrace it and get it under control, otherwise he'll burst. His only hope lies in the Guardians of the Veil, a secret and well-hidden society that holds the knowledge of the Song. In order to learn how to master his gift, he has to find them, and he has to do it quick. And that's only just the beginning of the many dangers and adventures he'll have to face. 
 This was, hands down, one of the most wonderful fantasy books I have read in the past few years. I wasn't even 50 pages into this book before it downed on me that I am beginning something truly extraordinary. And the feeling stayed with me all the way to the end, leaving me impressed, amazed, slightly dazed and ultimately satisfied. Cooper's writing style is nothing short of spellbinding. It draws you in, holds your attention, gets you emotionally involved in the characters' story and leaves you breathless. And begging for more. There's no denying the fact that this lady have nailed her debut in a way that you really don't see very often. For that, and for the way she she brought all her characters to life and made me care about them, I am giving her a well-deserved standing ovation. 
 I'm not even sure what I loved more about this book - the way the story was driven by the beautifully fleshed out, convincing characters, or the way the events smoothly unfolded, allowing me to take pleasure in exploring all the intricacies of the plot. Or maybe it was the whole new concept of magic that won me over, or perhaps the chilling witch hunts and inquisition. Or maybe I'm just a total sucker for thrilling adventures and epic quests, sprinkled with danger and occasional humor. Whatever it was, it was good. 
 Gair's journey to self-discovery and self-acceptance was also very interesting to read about. His whole life he's been taught that magic is a sin. Every prayer he has learned was meant to steer him away from it. But when he heard the music, he couldn't resist opening his heart to it, it felt too good, too euphoric not to give in. And he struggled with that a lot. When we meet him, he's still not entirely sure whether he's a sinner, well-deserving of the punishment he's about to receive, or just an innocent victim with a gift. He has to face the cruelty of the world around him, all the while battling demons of his own. Trying to find his place in the world. And it was absolutely fascinating to be able to accompany him on this journey and see him transform from a scared, confused man with not much hope for the future, into a strong, confident, powerful character, ready to take on whatever new challenges are thrown his way. 
 All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed reading Songs of The Earth and I hope you realized by now that this is a title that simply must be on your shelf. I can't wait for the next installment!"
3,"I loved Meda's attitude. I found myself laughing a lot at her quips. She's not someone bad ass, but she's not those shy, innocent people either. She can fight, but she'll run away if she has the chance. She's that person who you like hanging out around because she has a sense of humor and because interesting things are always happening around her. 
 Meda wasn't consistent though. First, when Chi shows up at the asylum, she acts like someone sensitive. Then, somehow, she ends up being Emma the bad ass at the Crusader school. Huh? I think if she'd stuck acting like either one until that part where Jo and Chi find out who she actually is at the Demon headquarters, there would've been a bigger effect. Some parts of the book felt choppy, especially her time at the Crusader school. 
 One thing I liked about this book was that unexpected things kept happening. Just when you thought that things had settled down to normal... then BAM! Something unexpected happened."
4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 If you start reading this book expecting to find Shakespeare in it, you'll disappointed. But if you take the book as it is, a simple gay ""Harlequin"" that just wants to entertain and let you meet likable characters, then you will be more than content. I definitely was. 
 I liked not just Jamie and Ethan, the main heroes, but the secondary characters too. Even Fred the dog and Spot the horse with ""character"" were lovable! 
 Though there were a couple of things that annoyed me a bit and some things that I missed. Jamie calling Ethan ""my cowboy"" all the time. I know that ""cowboy"" was a substitute for ""lover"" but sometimes, less is better, really. The fact that gay characters kept popping up was great for possible sequels - and yay for sequels, really - but it was a bit too rose-colored. And I would have liked to see more of a confrontation between Jamie and his father. Jacob's contempt was more described than really felt. 
 But as I said, this is a gay romance with a happy ending, as it should be, and I'm quite happy with that :)"
5,"F**KING. BRILLIANT. 
 I'm blown away! Ms. Walker, you just turned me into a fan! 
 Since I had friends here on Goodreads, great reviews for N.R. Walker's books floats on my feed from time to time. I was always intrigued as to why. And then I started to read one of her books with Dani (Hi there!). It was Taxes and TARDIS. I liked it. But it didn't wowed me. 
 But this one, OH WOW. 
 Everything was so great, it was perfect actually! 
 The writing, the plot, the portrayal of the character's jobs, the setting, the main characters, the secondary characters, their characterizations, the romance, the sex, the tackle of sensitive topics...all of it was AMAZING. 
 Cameron & Lucas 
 I can't find faults in this one. If there's one I can nitpick, it would be how this could happen in real life. But who cares? It's a romance read, not a newspaper. You would want to be transported to a world where two people who had different minds to find each other and fall for one another. This what the read did. And it was done beautifully. 
 I'm almost floored with this one. Not only the story ended in a spectacular way, there was even a sweet bonus!!! And did I tell you that this is for 
 FREE??? 
 C'mon, just grab it! 
 A VERY VERY VERY RECOMMENDED and A MUST READ 
 for any M/M Romance fan. 
 A great starter for those who want to delve to the M/M genre as well!"
4,"After finishing this audiobook (which was 14 hours long), I realized that I'll miss the characters in this book. This book was certainly wasn't perfect but wow, Born Confused is undeniably special. 
 - This book explores a variety of themes - family, friendship, love, arranged marriages, cultural identity, alienation from her Indian heritage, following your dreams, and growing up - all which are explored very thoroughly and with nuance. 
 - Loved how the narrative grew with Dimple; how her perceptions and presumptions change as she learns more about her identity and that she can be proud of it. 
 - Features a complex friendship with her best friend, Gwyn, who is white and does try to appropriate Dimple's culture. 
 - The romance was sweet but a little lacking in dimension and depth. 
 - Lastly, it was long. Positive: everything was thoroughly developed and made the narrative multifaceted and complex. Negative: it does feel like it drags a little bit."
3,3.5 rounded down to 3.
0,"This story sounds like a dream! 
 The cover is so original, I can't wait to get my hands on the hardcover for a change. Oh, I want it so badly I could actually cry."
3,"This books has quite a number of flaws, yet I thought it was a pleasant read. I definitely have a thing for bikers, which might explain it..."
4,"This series is actually reallly good, you get a set up from the previous novel and the Penelope gives you more than you expected. Jake is no different. 
 We met Jake in Gemini and hearing about his whole story now is like peeling away the layers of an onion. We learn a little bit more about slowly but surely right along with Nina. While Jake is saving Nina from herself and her fears, it turns out she is saving him right back. Watching this all come together was so sweet and a great read."
3,"I've come to expect really great, relatable, relationship stories from Rainbow Rowell, and this one was just okay. The relationships in Carry On just weren't developed or explored in the way I wanted, and maybe because they were based on other characters from Harry Potter, so the expectation was we already know the situation? That goes for the setting, too--if you're going to write a fantasy, you need to do some world-building and not just dump the reader into a time and space you assume they might *kind of* know, especially if you're deviating from your reference point. Once again, I'm always harping on what I didn't like, but the book is still very fun, engaging, and readable."
4,"Recently re-read this for a group read.. I read it when it first hit shelves and sad to say, its like reading it for the first time... i almost remember nothing. :( I couldnt even remember the ending, how strange is that? 
 And I am leaving the four stars i originally posted this with, as it was from the inital read, though if i was posting this for the first time, it would only get two or three. 
 Maybe my tastes have changed alot over the years, I didnt really like it as much reading it a second time. Hmmm.. go figure. I suppose some things are just better left alone."

 Like ""When Harry Met Sally"", but if Harry had Asberger's. In fact the main character Don watches that movie in the novel. Lots of fun parts and quotable lines, but I think plausibility was stretched too far. A nice and quick read. The writer is Australian. I'm sure it'll become a hit movie. It was actually an unshot screenplay before it was a novel."
4,"What a magical book! It is slow at some parts but the beautiful writing and the dream like setting totally makes up for it. 
 Review in Swedish at Boktycke."
4,"As usual, LHA's writing in this novel is tight and somehow familiar--you feel good reading it; I don't know how else to describe it. She deals with the characters' trauma/PTSD gracefully and honestly, and I think the emotional resonance in the book comes through in a lasting way. I loved the Hayley/Finn romance--very cute, very real-feeling. I never quite latched onto the italicized war flashback sections, but I never am a big fan of deviations from the main teen's story in YA. The final scene at the quarry was one of the most crystal clear and haunting sections I can remember reading in an LHA book. That said, this was probably overall my least favorite of the LHA books I've read. Which is hardly a negative thing to say, really, but...it lacked the lasting gravity of Speak or Wintergirls, two books that I think about almost constantly and to which I feel drawn back to every time I think about rereading a favorite. I probably won't feel the urge to reread TIKoM any time soon."
3,"Jacob and his peculiar friends Emma (fire hands) and Addison (talking dog) escape war-torn London on the hunt for their kidnapped ymbryne Miss Peregrine and the other peculiar children. Along the way, Jacob discovers that he can speak to Hollows, and this talent comes in handy as they find their way to Devil's Acre, a time-loop in the dirtiest slums of London. They make new peculiar friends along the way, and the old peculiar tales of the Library of Souls seems to be the focus of the kidnapping that has taken place. 
 I couldn't quite remember the ending of Hollow City, but since this begins in the middle of the action, all I really needed to remember was that they were escaping the city and had lost most of their friends. Once they reached Devil's Acre, the story really took off. The photographs added a little something extra to the text which I really enjoyed. I felt a little bit like Jacob and Emma's love story was wooden - I didn't really feel the chemistry. Also, I thought the treatment of the hollows was kind of... harsh? Yeah, they're monsters, but if you can speak their language, and communicate with them, it makes them a little less monstrous. At least, to me. But they were essentially used as expendable pawns and treated poorly. Overall, I thought this was a good conclusion to the series."
3,"While I wasn't as gung-ho Divergent as some readers, I did enjoy the book enough to wonder what happened next. 
 Well, what happened next was a lot of whining, some bad pacing and a weak surprise. 
 Firstly, I was disappointed by how little time was spent at Aminity. I mean, they're symbol is on the book cover! How can we spend less than 1/5 of the book there? 
 Then there was Tris. OOOHHH, TRIS. I wanted to strangle her. I think if we added up all of the pages spend on Tris aching over killing Will we'd have 200 pages of the book. Yeah. While I think she needed to grieve, needed to deal with the consequences of her actions, and should be haunted by it, there was so much of it, I wanted to gag. It got so bad I wanted to yell at Tris to get over herself. 
 Then there was Tris and the lying. Um, why are you lying to everyone Tris? For as far as I can tell no real reason! Oh, but everyone just needs to trust you. Why? You can't be truthful about anything in this book. You're just a hypocrite. 
 There were brief bits of this book that worked awesomely. How Tris escapes her depression. Candor was surprisingly cool. Oh, and I loved that the romantic tension came from Tris and Tobias struggling to stay together. No forced love triangle there, and yeah, relationships are totally hard to keep together. Way to go Roth. 
 (view spoiler)[But the ending. Oh the ending. When I finished reading that they were part of a simulation, which right around halfway through the book I figured out, because, well, there's so much focus on simulation, I just wanted to throw the book across the room. For some reason, I didn't feel this secret, maybe because it was only ONE generation removed, was worth killing all of Abnegation for? I just went, um, is that it? Really? Ugh. (hide spoiler)] 
 As much as this book grinds my gears, and could do with about two hundred pages of trimming, I still enjoyed the series. My problems with this book has mostly to do with MBS (Middle Book Syndrome). The tension was so high at the end of Divergent we needed a break, but the break lasted too long and was too confusing and too drawn out. The plot points of this book didn't need 500+ pages. But, because we needed to make room for book 3 (which I'm going to bet will be called EMERGENT, though my roommate came up with Indulgent, and I thought that was fab), we had a long drawn out middle. But as I will say, I'm in this series for the long haul."
4,"Really like the development of Calaena's character and the struggle she has to redeem herself in her own eyes from all her real and perceived failures in the past. Also liked the addition of a father/friend figure and the witch storyline, though it really never converges in this book with the main plot. This is definitely a mid-series story-lots of threads waiting for a bigger conclusion in the next book. One critcism-like many YA fantasies/novels I've read recently, there is a token gay relationship not central to the plot."
4,"My least favorite of this trilogy, but still a good read."
5,"This book, this book, this book. Who knew evil librarians could make for such an engaging story?"
4,"Paper Towns was great. It is my third John Green novel, and while it's my least favorite of the three, I still enjoyed it. I love how the author creates such fun and quirky teenagers who are also smart and deep. His characters have so much hope. He captures all that it is to be a teen when your entire future is ahead of you. Who you are, who you will be, and the people that will stay with you through it all hang in the balance when you're 16 or 17. We adults so often see the immature teens or the ones who don't care about their future at all, but we forget about the ones who do care. John Green's books remind me of me when I was that age, so full of hope and love, almost overwhelmed by all my possibilities. 
 Q, Ben, and Radar were awesome characters. They were pretty realistic and hilarious and were the main reason the novel was so entertaining. Q was the main character and he had a crush on his next door neighbor and popular girl, Margo Roth Spiegelman. I loved the way he looked at her. She wasn't one of those popular girls who are shallow or vapid. Instead, Margo was an enigma, full of mystery. I never understood what it was that made Q continue to care about her even after they stopped talking as kids, but he still liked her through all those years. 
 Out of the blue, Margo enlisted Q's help to take revenge on her so-called friends. I have to admit, this was the most epic part of the book. The entire night and Margo's insane and yet brilliant ideas were hilarious and entertaining. While I've never done anything quite so crazy, I still felt like I could relate in some ways to their epic night. Breaking the mold, taking chances, doing something a little crazy were all things we did as teens. We bonded with people over it and we grew up, changed perspectives, or just simply had fun. And that's what happened to Q. 
 Q thought of all the possibilities after that night, but things didn't quite go as he planned. Margo, ever the mystery, left strange clues and Q had to figure them out to get to her. The part of the book directly after the epic night was also enjoyable. I got to spend time with Q's friends, Ben and Radar, as they helped Q figure out the clues. All of the clues were crazy and led up to an epic road trip to find Margo in a paper town. I loved the way the friends bonded, especially during the road trip. 
 Paper Towns captured a lot about adolescence, people, and selfishness. It talked about the way people expect or see other people differently than they really are. It wasn't just about people we liked or had crushes on, but our friends, too. Accepting people for who they are and genuinely listening to them and helping them with their problems is easier said than done. I love the way poetry played a role in the book, especially given that any poem can mean different things to different people and mean different things as a whole versus sections of it. I've always been intrigued by how people can read the same thing and take totally different meanings from it. In a sense, people are the same way. We view others and interpret their actions differently than how they may have meant them to be interpreted. 
 Some reviews mention that the book is essentially the same as Looking For Alaska in many ways. I saw these reviews before I started, so I was actively trying to sense similarities, but I don't think they are the same. Besides the quirky characters and the out-of-your-league aloof love interest, I didn't see a lot of similarities. 
 The ending of Paper Towns was both awesome and horrible. It couldn't have ended any other way, but it was also disappointing at the same time. I absolutely think it was right and I wouldn't have necessarily wanted another ending, but I couldn't help but feel a little... eh. If you read the book, you'll know what I mean. It's tough to explain without spoilers. I definitely still recommend the novel. I am a fan of John Green. While I haven't read everything of his, I like his style a lot.

4,"I have been warned by so many people about how sad TFiOS is and how I need to have a box of tissues beside me throughout the whole book because I will need it. However what they failed to mention is how humorous, how full of life the characters were. The female protagonist, Hazel Grace has thyroid cancer, she has to carry and is connected to an oxygen tank with her all the time to breath. At the opening of the book you see her depressed and a hermit. Only leaves the house when she is forced to go to the cancer support group. However one day she meets Augustus Waters. Augustus Waters was everything good in a fictional male protagonist. He was funny, spoke his mind, was smart, and loved with no limits. He had osteosarcoma (for those who don't know, that is bone cancer). His right leg was prosthetic but his larger than life personality overshadowed his handicap. I really loved both characters whole heartedly. Augustus and Hazel Grace were just two kids struggling through their sickness and finding true love in each other. 
 Some quotes from the book I enjoyed to the point that I labeled them include: 
 ""I told Augustus the broad outline of my miracle: diagnosed with Stage IV thyroid cancer when I was thirteen. (I didn't tell him that the diagnosis came three months after I got my first period. Like: Congratulations! You're a woman. Now die.) "" - Hazel Grace 
 ""What am I at war with? My cancer. And what is my cancer? My cancer is me. The tumors are made of me. They're made of me as surely as my brain and my heart are made of me. It is a civil war Hazel Grace, with a predetermined winner."" - Augustus Waters 
 I also loved how supportive Hazel Grace's family is. Her dad and mom broke my heart the most. They were so caring, so motherly and fatherly and it was definitely a nice change from the usual dysfunctional family you see in YA books. I am actually a person that cries at any tiny sad thing but surprisingly I didn't cry during TFiOS. I honestly don't know why, but I think it is because I was already prepared for the worst and it being a book about two cancer kids falling in love? it was inevitable that one of them, if not both would die (that is not a spoiler alert!). I think I am just becoming immune to sad novels, I read too many sad books them! 
 The only thing that I didn't enjoy as much was the amount of pages spent on An Imperial Affliction, which was a fiction novel about a girl with cancer that Hazel and then Gus love, and the need for both Gus and Hazel to find out the true ending. I just felt it got a bit draggy, especially when the author of the book turned out to be such a jerk. However other secondary characters like Isaac, whose his humor left me gaping because they mostly revolved around making fun of his own cancer and his 'impeding death'. I would laugh and then catch myself and think ""How could I laugh at his situation?"" but I'm guessing that is exactly why any person with a sickness feels disconnected with others, We treat them as if they are fragile flowers, watch every word we say, and stay guarded, but while thinking we are protecting them, we are making them feel as if we are becoming more distant from them. Which is why TFiOS felt more real, because Hazel, Gus, and Isaac all had cancer, so they could speak their minds, joke, and make fun of each other and their sickness without restraint. I believe that was the beauty of the book. The easiness of the characters and the absence of a mouth filter in all the characters! I really recommend this book to all contemporary fans, and if you're scared you're going to cry your eyes out, I say go for it, this book has officially made me a John Green fan.

5,"Beware! I loved this book so much, I have many many quotes :) :) :) 
 I'm going through a bit of a contemporary romance/young adult stage at the moment, which is weird. Usually I am all about pnr or uf, so I'm enjoying a bit of a switch up! 
 This book was super fun. I knew from the very first page that I was going to love it. Sometimes I just need a really easy book to immerse myself in, one that doesn't need much thinking. This was it. I was grinning nearly the whole way through. I adored reading her thoughts as a young girl. Here are a few of my favorite bits that I related to; 
 Important Things I have learned in my life so far; 
 4. When you have the choice, play with a boy. Boys are easy to get along with. They don't care if your clothes match, or if your hair is a mess. Boys don't talk behind your back or make up stories about you to try to hurt your feelings. They are too busy playing sports or video games.

 He thinks HE is SO COOL! 
 The first day he moved here, he told me how he's a great quarterback. 
 I told him to stop bragging. It's not nice. 
 But he went I'm not bragging, I'm just confident in my skills. 
 Whatever. 
 I figured the kids at school would hate him because no one likes a bragger, right? Right? 
 Wrong!

 Well his advice on boys might be good, but evidently he's forgotten the Laws of Fifth Grade. You CAN only have one best friend. That's okay though; his memory is probably going bad because he's getting so old. He is thirty-eight after all. 
 We follow JJ through life reading parts she felt were so mementos she recorded them in journal fashion. We watch her grow up from a fiery little Princess from 4th grade into a confident and stubborn woman who knows her mind. As she grows so does her relationship with her 2 best friends. Phillip and Danny - this friendship made the book. They have been friends forever. The kind of friends that are there for each other through thick and thin. Unconditional. With Phillip, he keeps her grounded and safe. While Danny seemed to be the fun, adventurous friend. (To all my mummy friends, I know you are just thinking - Danny sounds like the fun one. The dad!) Both were beautiful friendships with so many wonderful, funny moments. She had me laughing out loud remembering when I used to act and speak this way; 
 I mean, this date is of EPIC proportions. 
 He's a senior for God's sake! 
 My high school reputation could be ruined or made in one single night. 
 I don't want to be known as a terrible kisser! 
 Or Worse! Totally Inexperienced! 
 I've got to do something. 
 Get me somebody, anybody! 
 I need someone who has experience and, most importantly, who will help me. 
 I glance out my window and see Danny's bedroom light it on. 
 Ch-Ching. 
 Danny has experience, and I'm too desperate to be embarrassed.

 And I swear, each bean row must be, at a minimum, several hundred miles long. 
 At least that's what it felt like. 
 After about four hours of walking beans, I have to admit, I was ready to use the scythe on myself, just to make the misery stop. But then I figured I'd forever be remembered as the girl who killed herself in a bean field. 
 Not exactly the legacy I am hoping for!

 I know there are large, really important issues in the world. World peace, terrorism, nuclear arms and global warming. But honestly, finding the perfect swimsuit has got to be top of most women's list, regardless of race, religion, political, or sexual orientation. So in finding this perfect bikini, I really feel I've done my part to help conquer this great world issue. 
 JJ struggled at times just like any of us. If she wasn't trying to figure out how to survive being a teenager, she was surviving a tragedy, then she was learning how to grow into herself and her body or learning about human nature and trying to live in every moment. To me she was not just a character from a story, it was like growing up with her. Her honesty us refreshing. 
 So I ask for more clarification, ""Like just being around them or actual physical contact?""

 ""We may need for paper for that, Doc,"" Phillip, the comedian in the corner says. 
 ""Shut up, Phillip,"" I glare at him. 
 But he continues, ""Just bring in the student directory. We can use a highlighter, might go faster."" 
 There was a lot of emphasis on JJ looking for love all throughout, but I thought she was wonderful and I knew she would find THAT boy in the end. 
 Somewhere, my prince is waiting. 
 Ha! 
 Actually, I don't think he's waiting. I think he's hiding from me. 
 I was so happy she found him! 
 I am so looking forward to reading ""That Wedding"" next. I can't wait to hear what's happening with Danny, Phillip and JJ..."
3,"Better than the first one, but i'm not entirely sure of the target age. I'm 18 and i feel like i would enjoy it a lot more if i was twelve, idk though."
5,Reread and its even better the second time round
4,"This was definitely my favorite Cassandra Clare series. 
 There were some crossover from mortal instruments that I was fuzzy on, I won't elaborate because they're spoilers. All in all, chalk full of goodness."
4,"Ruined is the first book in the Ethan Frost romance series. It is a very well written and well edited novel. In my reading of the ARC no proof reading errors jumped out at me, which is a rare occurrence. 
 The plot of Ruined is a familiar one: damaged young woman catches the eye of the equally damaged billionaire businessman and they fall in love amongst the angst and drama of their lives. However the author has enough original twists in the plot to make it feel new and interesting. 
 Ethan is written as being a steady and good man. Even though he makes mistakes it is with good intentions. I want him to date my daughter. 
 Chloe drove me crazy. In the first chapters she came across as having a sharp sense of humor and I had great hopes for her, but she began to constantly repeat her insecurities in her thoughts in every situation she was in. It became very redundant. I would have liked her better if she was written as being flawed, but resilient. 
 The last chapters of the book had me caught on this series hook, line and sinker. The ending was so dramatic and unsuspected that I wanted the next book to be released NOW. Needless to say, it is a cliffhanger. 
 I think any lover of romance will like Ruined.

3,"This was the first book that I've been able to actually finish as of late! It seems that I'm going through the ""OMG why did I start reading this crap"" stage. More often that not, I end up reverting back to some of my all time favs just to read something worth reading when having a bad book day, but Revelation I didn't mind... 
 The first encounter that Eve and Asher had together was probably the saving grace for me continuing. I thought their banter was hilarious, yes I did LOL. 
 Eve could be a very stubborn character, and at times became frustrating, but all in all even though it wasn't the greatest thing I've read, it was a joy to finish the book atleast .. so props in my eyes."
5,"This book is amazing! Colleen Hoover's books are ALL a must read! 
 This book...you really need to prepare yourself. It's about a girl named Sky and how she and her best friend Six makes out with a bunch of guys and she does it because she feels numb while doing it. There's a reason behind this and while you dig deeper into the book, you're going to have to prepare yourself because the secrets are exposed and they are going to be tumbling down at you and you're just going to have to control yourself from screaming or saying ""Oh my god! over and over again. The story leaves you so many clues in the beginning but we as readers don't pay attention to them until we're like halfway down the book and everything becomes suspicious and then you recall everything that has happened previously. You're going to feel frustrated, angry, confused, and you're gonna laugh a lot . Sky meets this boy named Dean Holder and she knows there is something different about him. As Holder spends more time with Sky, he realizes a deep shocking secret from 13 years ago and he feels like he can't uncover the secret or it will ruin Sky's life. I have to say that I enjoyed this story so much 
 Also, there are two novellas after this novel which are called Losing Hope which is by Holder's perspective about him meeting Sky for the first time and his story about his twin sister. 
 Then, there is another novella which is called Finding Cinderella which is a sorta of continuation of this story just different characters and they are Six, Sky's best friend and Holder's best friend, Daniel. 
 I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ANYONE TO READ THIS BOOK 
 * Just saying, I read Ugly Love for the first time by Colleen Hoover and I got so obsessed with her writing and her stories that I haven't stopped buying all the books that she has written 
 This book deserves a 5 Star rating :)"
4,A very interesting and thought-provoking read.
5,"You can also find my review at: https://booksbestfriendblog.wordpress... 
 I loved Human Acts, Kang's latest work, and couldn't wait to read her novel that won the Man Booker International Prize. It did not disappoint. It was unsettling, haunting, and incredibly weird at parts (mainly thinking about the second section), but it lived up to its critical acclaim. 
 The best way to describe this is beautifully haunting, or hauntingly beautiful. Kang tells in incredibly bizarre and sometimes violent story of one woman's decision about her body in emotionally moving prose. She lets the story stand on its own with perfectly simple yet poetic language. I feel so pretentious just writing that, but it is an amazing book. 
 The Vegetarian starts with a perfectly ordinary man in South Korea going about his life perfectly content. Then one day his wife has a dream and throws out all of the meat in the house, becoming a vegetarian. He sees this as a serious threat to the unremarkable and socially accepted life they had that he desperately wants to keep. His previously quiet and submissive wife isn't reconsidering, though, and instead chooses takes a stand on this choice. 
 Despite it being her body, there is a disturbing insinuation that she should not be able to make decisions that don't have his approval. When her family get involved next they claim it is because of her health. However, her father's rage when she disobeys his order to eat meat shows that control and power also play a role. Does she as a human being get to control what she does with her body, or as a woman are her choices able to be vetoed by the men in her life? 
 As the book progresses we see the effects of her choice through three people: her husband, her brother-in-law, and her sister. It's interesting that we never get to see her life from her point of view. I particularly enjoyed the sister's part as it explored the obligations people have to those around them and also whether or not is it possible to shed some of the more violent aspects of our nature. 
 I highly recommend this anyone interested in a haunting tale of a woman's life or contemporary Korean literature."
5,"Namid created the world and all those in it. When Namid created humans they were given a small part of the world; it was only after they ventured out of their area that they realized they were not the dominate species. The rest of the world was controlled by the Others and the humans had to learn to live with them. The Others are shapeshifters, vampires, elementals and others who you really don't want to know about. As the humans moved out into the world they negotiated settlements with the Others who controlled the areas. Soon there are human towns surrounded by the terra indigene who control the world. There are also human cities with terra indigene Courtyards. The Others control the world and everything in it; they decide where the humans live, how long they live there and what resources they get. It is up to the humans to become more than prey. 
 Meg is a cassandra sangue, a blood prophet, who sees prophecies when her skin is cut. She has run away from the Controller who operated the compound where she lived and controlled all aspects of her life. She ends up at the Lakeside Courtyard where she meets Simon Wolfgard and is given the job of human liaison. It is her responsibility to take in all the mail and packages the residents of the Courtyard receive and make sure they are properly distributed. Lakeside isn't like other Courtyards in that they interact more with the humans. They have stores the humans can use and they have human employees. Meg's presence changes the dynamic of the Courtyard in a way no one could have foreseen. She forms relationships with the Others and with the humans in their employee. But Meg has powerful enemies and they are not willing to let such valuable property fall through their hands. They are determined to return her to the Controller not matter the cost. 
 Anne Bishop has again created a world and characters that suck you in and don't let go. I loved the world she created in Namid and the creatures that inhabit it. It is very much our world with a different history. I like the new take on shapeshifters and vampires and the fact that we get to know their motivations and what they think of humans. I LOVED the elementals; they are my favorite characters in this series. The action of the book was great and I liked that this is a planned series so nothing was really tied up at the end of this book. It isn't a cliff hanger, but there is a lot more story to tell in the future books in the series. I think the relationships between the characters and the world building are going to make this one of my favorite series."
4,"Naturally imperfect due to the writer's biases but brilliant underneath the occasional coldness of the narrative. 
 (Showcased in Top Ten Tuesday: My Syllabus for YA Sci-Fi 101)"
4,"This had a good ending. Though I didn't get everything I wanted, it was satisfying. Though it took me a long time to finally pick up the first book in this series, I'm really glad I waited so I could binge read all three books together. Those book endings would have been hard to read and then wait for the next book. This is definitely one of the best fantasy books I have read. Well rounded and no plot holes that I noticed or questions left unanswered."
2,"Rate: 2.0 stars 
 Falling Kingdoms definitely did not live up to the hype. The only reason the rating is 2-stars was because the character backstory was so interesting. 
 Here are a few things that I had a problem with: 
 * There is no development in the three different settings. Essentially, the differences are: poor, rich, cruel. 
 * The language in the book was so inconsistent. I you're going to talk like a royal person, talk like a royal person throughout the whole entire book. Speaking of which, the speech was so awkward. It was like the author was trying to make it sound elegant and flowy, but, ultimately, failed. 
 Everyone kind of sounds the same, too. You would think that Jonas would be uneducated and would use vocabulary similar to slang used in southern U.S. It's kind of like the author didn't really think about how each of the characters would have behaved. 
 * Almost every important-ish character gets a point-of-view. Honestly, I knew everything that was going to happen because every character had a POV. I wish a few things would have been kept secret. While I understood the point of receiving a few chapters here and there with Alexius's POV, I didn't understand the point of having a few chapters in Theon, Lucia, and Jana's POV. 
 * If Lucia is the prophesied sorceress, shouldn't she have more chapters during the book? Honestly, why did we need so many chapters in Magnus's POV... Actually, why did we need any chapters in his POV. We could have found out about what his dad was telling Magnus through Lucia. And, half of the time, the other characters were around Magnus's shit to tell us what was going on. Magnus brings me to my next point: 
 * Magnus. Okay, but falling in love with your sister is, I dunno, kind of weird, even if she isn't your blood sister. I can't see where this relationship is going to in the first place. Wouldn't he want to protect his sister just because she's his sister? How does this even pertain to the plot? Couldn't we have taken out those weird angst feelings about how his sister just views him as a brother for actual development of the setting? 
 Not only is this love interest weird, but the way Magnus controls his sister's life is just... weird. He literally stopped her from having friends or suitors, lied to people to stop him from talking to Lucia, and hurt himself to get near her. Please tell me the author does not promote this behavior in the sequels. 
 * Here's a joke: Two boys walk into the wise chief's house. One boy wants to start a war because some drunk-ass dude from that rich country killed his brother. The chief lets them lead the war. What happens to the wise chief after the war? (view spoiler)[ He dies. (hide spoiler)] 
 * Princesses escaping guards every goddamn second, as if the guards aren't trained."
3,From the very first poge this reminded me of Insanity by Lauren Hammond and sadly although it was a very intense book I couldn't get passed that .Too many same scenarios .
4,The one thing this book really had going for it was entertainment value. I found it kept my attention and kept me interested and engaged in the story. It wasn't the best written book I've ever written but it more than makes up for it with a good entertainment value. There definitely parts I found predictable and some dialogue was really cheesy. Though I get the impression that the books continue to get better from the first one so I look forward to continuing this series. I also look forward to seeing how the characters change and plot develop in the next books.
3,"I'm not sure what to day about Ship Breaker. It has received great reviews but didn't really inspire any strong emotions or impressions for me. I liked that a lot of the adventure took place in ships on the ocean. I liked the creepy half-men that are genetic mutations of humans, tigers, hyenas, and dogs. I didn't every really connect with Naylor, the narrator of the story. I didn't particularly care for the audiobook narrator. This one was pretty much a draw for me. I didn't mind listening but don't know that I'll remember much about it this time next year."
4,"A fairly straight-forward romance, as others have noted, between a guy who has to leave the special forces to raise his deceased sister's 13-year-old orphan and a guidance counselor who befriends her. I like stories with kids and families so I enjoyed this one. The build up to the romance was slow and I liked that. There were quite a few sex scenes in the rest of the book which were a little ho hum to me. But if you like romances with military men and/or kids, I recommend this."
2,"Lame imitation of Bronte's unreliable narrator, Lucy Snowe, and Du Maurier's nameless narrator in Rebecca. Throw in there Austen's Fanny Price for the weak-willed, resigned factor and you have the character of Offred, someone the reader dislikes and is practically rooting to be sent to the Colonies to end the reader's misery whilst reading this plotless intent of a novel. 
 Although considered by many to be a 'feminist' novel, it is anything but. It actually depicts how extreme feminism led to women's downfall and in turn gave more power to men. The main character is anything but a feminist as she goes against her kind: becoming a married man's lover, for instance, and later is certainly not sympathetic to other womens' plight, and is instead quite misogynistic. Women in general are depicted in a negative light, except for maybe Ofled, who had a bad ending, and Moira, who was also properly 'punished' for her 'independent' ways. 
 If one wishes to read a real feminist novel, one ahead of its time, I urge everyone not to waste their time in this drivel and read Anne Bronte's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, which shook Victorian society to its core to the extent of having her sister, Charlotte, taking it out of circulation after Anne's death due to the strong message sent out to all women."
5,"Uhhhhhmazing!!!!!!! 
 This was the perfect ending ever!!!"
4,"This is sooo close to being a 5-star book for me. So, so close. 
 A lot of TV series follow the basic ""A Plot and B Plot"" style of storytelling. Good TV shows manage to connect them thematically and then tie them together into one story by the end. Vinge does this here. 
 On the macro scale we have the Blight, an ancient, malevolent virus that takes over everyone in its path, human and alien alike. On the smaller scale we have two kids stranded on an alien planet along with a bunch of their friends in cryosleep. The kids are the offspring of some of the explorers who accidentally woke up the Blight and who ran from it once they realized what they'd inadvertently unleashed. 
 Other reviewers go into more detail about the plot, but that's the gist. The Blight taking over the universe is the B plot, while the castaway kids are the A plot. This is pretty epic in scope. On the one hand we have classic Space Opera and on the other good old-fashioned Planetary Romance. So far, so good. 
 For me, the real standout part of the book is the kids' adventure among the aliens they call the Tines. This is the sort of thing I read science fiction to encounter: aliens who are different from anything we have on Earth. The Tines are compared to wolves and dogs by the kids, but to me they seem like meerkats. They're run in small packs of 4 to 6 individuals who combine into a larger hive mind. They have vibratory tympanum on their heads, shoulders and haunches that allow them to communicate exactly what they're thinking to each other. Truly exceptional Tines can have 3 members or 8 members and still be a cohesive ""person."" But usually less than 4 means they're not very bright and more than 6 makes them an unruly mob pulling into too many directions at once. 
 Vinge's introduction of the concept of these aliens should be taught in writing classes, because he reveals piece by piece how they work over the course of a chapter, and you slowly realize that the ""person"" you're following is made up of several distinct sub-sentient individuals. It's extremely cool, and one of the best introductions of an alien species I've encountered. 
 He delves deeply into the benefits and detriments of how such a pack-based hive mind species would work but leaves plenty of unanswered (and unasked) questions so we can speculate on our own. That's great fun. 
 One of the major detriments to how they link together is that when too many of them are within close proximity to each other, they literally can't hear themselves think. So in instances of battle or simple crowding, it's possible for individual members of a pack to get killed or lost or otherwise cut off from the rest, and it devolves into chaos. Then they become no brighter than an animal and resort to base instincts. A person who loses all but one or two members basically has a lobotomy, and if those individuals join into other packs, the new personality is substantially different than the original. 
 That's not true in all cases, however, as some individuals are particularly bright or have a sure sense of themselves, which means a duo could merge with three or four others and essentially take over that new pack, reconstituting a facsimile of the original personality. These creatures tend to be dominant personalities, and given the medieval society they live in, become a combination of Genghis Khan or Napoleon, sometimes devolving into Hannibal Lecter, cruel geniuses who bully and destroy those around them. 
 The bonus is that these strong personalities can basically live for hundreds of years as they assume control of new members who join the pack. Several generations of individual members later they would be different people, but at their core they would be the same. The way around this is via controlled inbreeding, either by using selective breeding of others to create a puppy with particular attributes or to have the members continually have sex among themselves. Which raises the interesting question: is it considered incest if the individuals of a pack have sex with each other generation after generation, or is that parthenogenesis? We'd probably need a new word to describe this activity. 
 Unfortunately, while such inbreeding creates a centuries-old stable personality, it also results in sickly, infirm or deformed pack members. Who can then devolve into insanity... or worse. See Hannibal Lecter, above. 
 And such creatures are at the heart of this story. It certainly gives a new spin on politics, as well as dynasties. I would have enjoyed reading an entire novel just examining the various permutations of this shared-mind pack species, but there is that pesky B plot to attend to. 
 In and of itself, the B plot about the ancient Blight taking over the galaxy is pretty standard fare. We've seen this before in other books with epic scope. I'm pretty sure the guys at BioWare based a large part of the backstory for the Mass Effect videogames on this aspect of the book. There are too many similarities to ignore. I would say they mashed up the overarching idea of the Blight with the Force from Star Wars and created their own universe. Which doesn't bother me, because that's how we get new variations on a theme. After all, George Lucas wanted to make a Flash Gordon movie but couldn't get the rights to it, so he combined the situations and characters of Flash Gordon with those in Akira Kurosawa's Hidden Fortress and added a little sprinkling of pirate movies and Westerns for flavor. 
 The other aspect of this book that's different from similar space operas is the idea of the Zones of Thought. Basically this is an artificially-imposed limitation to technology. There is a vast area of lower technology comprising the bulk of the galaxy, an area in a ring that allows for higher technology, and finally an area that allows for incredible technology on the outer rim, with no limitations beyond that. 
 Near the core of the galaxy very little works for long. Errors are introduced and things start breaking. So while you can have anti-gravity and super-intelligent AI in the outer rim, the deeper you go toward the center of the galaxy the less reliable those things become until they quickly stop working. 
 At first this seems like a pure Fantasy element in an otherwise solidly science fictional universe, but then Vinge reveals that this story takes place tens of thousands of years from now among civilizations which are millions or billions of years old, and basically what we're seeing is an entire galaxy that is living in a post-Singularity time. The implication being that we're currently living under the constraints of the Singularity, which is why we can't get AI to work. But beyond the rim civilizations can Transcend and become godlike. 
 Too bad for them, the Blight is also godlike. Just not good. 
 So we get battles in space as civilizations fight the Blight, and battles on the Tine world as these Napoleon and Hitlers battle for supremacy. Meanwhile, our main characters are swept up in both of these conflicts. 
 As the stories converge it's clear that the solution to the Blight rests with the stranded kids. Unfortunately, this part of the story was telegraphed, becoming very anticlimactic. It means parts of the war against the Blight slow to a crawl because we know what has to happen to defeat it. The only thing I didn't see was the specific aspect of the Zones of Thought. I knew *something* was going to happen there with the various pieces, just not the exact solution, so there's that. But it was annoying waiting for it to occur for 300 pages. 
 All in all, though, this book is terrific. Could be a bit shorter, but the ideas are so interesting and the Tines are so cool that I didn't mind so much. As I said, these sorts of things are why I read SF in the first place."
3,"This book was pretty good. I like the whole plot of it, and I love the devotion the Donna and navin have for each other, and how just because they're close doesn't mean that they have to be romantically involved. The characters are all really good, and the storyline is entertaining and enjoyable. If there is another book after this, I will probably pick it up."
5,"Wasn't expecting to like it. Surprisingly, rather good."
3,"2.5 stars 
 The only thing is good in this one is the wedding, it will be five stars if only about that. 
 But pity, is only two chapters for the wedding in here. 
 The rest I HATE IT!!!! 
 All recycle stories, boo!!!! 
 Self pity Sam, want the baby, don't want the baby, depression, don't know what she want, jealous someone else had a baby but she went to the doctor ask for the pill. 
 I want a kick ass heroine not a coward!!! 
 I hate it, Ms. Force keep on and on about miscarriage in all books. 
 Let's talk about it shall we? 
 The first miscarriage happened after her decision for an abortion, so what, if it happen naturally? Didn't she wanted gone at the first place? No need self pity about it, take it and have it be an adult about that!!!! 
 The 2nd and 3rd miscarriage. To be honest it should happened as it was, want to have a baby because want to save a failed married? For God sake!!! Seriously Sam, seriously Ms. Force, didn't the kid need a better reason to be born than that? 
 The 4th miscarriage? 
 Ms. Force sucess in made me hating Sam. 
 Here we go, she have a chance to have the baby she want with the wonderful man of her life. 
 And what did she do? Burried her head in the sands, get the first opportunity to get punch and hit in the stomach!! Even a perfectly pregnancy won't survives if that situation happened. 
 You see Ms. Force, if you and publisher don't want involve or change the story line with a baby in the books is fine but no need to keep writing this stuff all the time, you annoying me. Miscarriage not an easy subject to read again and again, also in my case is ruin the real story that you want us to enjoy. 
 Oh I read your website FAQ. 
 Sigh, a baby might be slowing a mother career but not ruin in. The idea not to have a baby because will change Sam's and Nick's convenience life story is simply unpleasant Ms. Force:( 
 And IF (as you write there) they will have them, you wanted them later by the end of this series. 
 Oh don't please don't!!! That's so Eve and Roarke:(((( 
 And we know Eve and Roarke horrible childhood, but they still want kids when the time is right. 
 Not like Nick who always wanted kids, Gosh didn't he deserve better? 
 So, please would you stop writing about miscarriage in the whole series? It made me sick... 
 The second recycles story. 
 Would you stop adding, who shot the daddy in the series too? Especially when you don't want to catch the guy? Taking too many pages for the real story and it really is tiresome! 
 Oh well, I think that's' all for now."
4,I definitely took my time reading this one because I'm slow and have a very long list of books to read. I enjoyed it overall because it's very original to anything I've read before and it's great to think about the possibility of everything happening in the book. The book did have lulls and wasn't my typical style of writing but it's one of those books that everyone should read because it is very enjoyable.
4,"Ok.. so I liked the sequel. It was enjoyable. I really like the plot. The only criticism I have is that it was flowing great and then I feel like so much happened.. but when it all came together at the end. The killer's identity specifically, it just came out of nowhere. And looking back I guess it connected well enough. I just felt like there were a lot of unanswered questions. And that is tough for an author because if you don't see the ending before you start writing the book. I shows in the writing. I still like this series though. I will probably read the third book."
5,"This book was well-written, and heartbreakingly beautiful. It dealt with the ups and downs of a couple with a big age difference would make. There was passion, pain, love, secrets, and happiness all wrapped up into this book. I loved every moment of it. I loved the fact we got to know more about Mark and his past. I got to see more of Cadence and how she dealt with his secret. I can't believe that (view spoiler)[ Mark was married, and was going to be a dad, but lost both his baby and his wife (hide spoiler)]. I understand him more as a character. Cadence acted kind of aggressive when she found out the secret, but I think this too made me understand her situation. I love Mark's mother, she is so understanding and loving. It was a beautiful story of love. The epilogue was my favourite part because (view spoiler)[ Cadence and Mark got married and had children (hide spoiler)]."
4,"Reviewed At: http://queenofteenfiction.blogspot.co... 
 I read so many books about demon hunters and dystopian worlds these days that I've completely forgotten about the type of book I first loved to read: Contemporary Romance. This book reminded me just how much I love to read a good love story that doesn't fail to put a goofy grin on your face. 
 First off - I love the title! It was the title that drew me to the book in the first place. It's just awesome. 
 I flew through this book in a day. I seriously couldn't put it down. Hadley and Oliver's story is set over a short time period: 24 hours. But within that time we learn so much about the two characters live and after a few chapters I was in love with them both! 
 The plot is simply adorable and pulls you in from the start. I loved the humour between Hadley and Oliver but I was kept hooked as to what was really going on in Oliver's life at that point. 
 The ending put a huge smile on my face and I know this is a story I won't forget for long time. It made me want to miss a flight in hope of finding my very own Oliver! 
 If you're looking for a funny, romantic read then this is definitely for you!"
3,"A quick enjoyable read. However, I wanted the story to go a different direction than the one it took. The characters were awesome, but I don't feel like there was a real climax or conflict. Something was just missing for me. Felt with some heavy issues of loss without being overly heavy."
1,"Hoooooooly shit you guys, this book was GARBAGE. I stand by my initial assessment of this book as being a stupid young teenage girl's wank-fest fantasy. This is like the absolute worst kind of Mary Sue fanfic trash that gives actual fanfic a bad name. People who write for free on the internet write better than this author. Nothing happens, and the author isn't skilled enough at building tension to make you care about the half-assed 'mysteries' she throws out to set up the sequels. Bored now. 
 Actual quote from this book: ""It was hard to believe how many people thought I'd be a good princess. Was I the only one who saw how flawed I was?"""
3,"I didn't actually remember what the details of the first book was. It seemed that I couldn't believe Nora's and Patch's relationship at first. How she was so in love with him. But I guess that's typical for sophomores. Also, some of the things that the characters were doing seemed too old of them. However, I thought the rest of the book was well written, albeit confusing (for me at least). I wish Scott had a little better character development and wasn't shrouded in too much mystery. The Marcie story line was a tad unrealistic as well. Why would she do hateful things to Nora and then invite her to a party as well? Overall, I'm not sure if I'll read the next book. I thoroughly enjoyed the first book when I read it, I devoured it. I'm not sure if I grew up a little since I read it or if it just isn't my cup of tea anymore. Who knows. Overall, If you are under 18, this book is for you."
5,"What? I haven't said anything about this book yet? 
 I've now read this book for two different book clubs. And I'm working on reading everything that Bacigalupi's ever published. The Windup Girl won the Hugo and the Nebula, and well-deserved both. 
 What makes this book so excellent? 
 Well, first, it posits a frightening, fully believable, and wholly realized future. Set an indeterminate amount of time from now, not all the details are filled in. The Expansion (a time period that we're obviously in right now) has occurred, followed by the Contraction (a period of economic and ecological collapse), and now it's been long enough that some people have schemes and dreams of rebuilding... but things potentially are just getting worse. What I like about the setting is that although not every detail is IN the book, you get the impression that they EXIST. Wars have occurred, names of countries have changed, crises have happened elsewhere, offstage... All the action takes place in the context of a world, not a little narrative bubble. 
 Bacigalupi also excels at portraying the intersection of individual and culture. All his people have depth of character as individuals, but their actions and behaviors are also informed not only by their circumstances but by their cultural background and/or group identity. Nearly all of the characters in the book are reprehensible people, who do unforgivable things. As a reader, however, you can't help feeling empathy, or at least, understanding, for nearly all of them, because their motivations make sense. Everyone in this book has a believable reason for behaving in the way that they do. Circumstance drives people to do as they do, and if you want to survive in this world, you have to have an eye for the main chance. 
 I don't think that a description of all the main characters is called for. The book reveals them. But it's unavoidable to mention the titular character, Emiko. A character genetically engineered and trained to be a slave and a sex toy. The mere premise causes a knee-jerk reaction in some people, and admittedly, doing this right could be hard to pull off. However, Bacigalupi does a fantastic job with her character. (I have to note here that any 'reviewer' who refers to Emiko as a ""robot"" did not actually read the book.) In creating her, and depicting what happens to her, he harshly criticizes some very real aspects of certain cultures which fully warrant that criticism, and does so fairly and accurately. (Not one culture or group in this book gets a pass, or is portrayed as 'good' - just about everyone has somehow been complicit in bringing the world to where it is.) But Emiko also exists not just as a political statement but as a fully realized, sympathetic character. Like all of us, she is torn between one instinct and another, conflicted, having to endure, able to find hidden reserves of strength to survive. She also shows us that whatever people try to do to humanity, people will always strive for freedom. And she also, finally, tells us that although technology may be the instrument and cause of our downfall, it also may be the only slim straw of our hope. 
 The book is not without aspects that I quibble with. One of the main premises of the book is that food is in short supply, and energy is measured in calories. People are described as on the brink of starvation. However, the book itself is FULL of food. People are constantly walking through markets full of fruits and vegetables, stopping at noodle stands, eating, eating eating. It undercuts the stated scarcity of food when you're seeing food everywhere. Also as far as the calories - I love the megadonts. It makes cultural sense that the Thai would want to genetically engineer giant elephants. BUT - how are they feeding them? Do you really get enough work out of feeding them to justify the expense? (That's actually already an issue with today's, smaller elephant in Southeast Asia.) 
 I loved that the book takes place in Thailand. In reality, Thailand is the only Asian kingdom that has continually maintained its independence and never fallen to an invader or colonial forces. It makes sense that in the future, they could be a last holdout, maintaining strength in isolation, protecting their heritage even while torn by internal conflict. 
 I didn't actually have a problem with the imaginary kink-spring tech. It's something people are working on. (http://www.asme.org/kb/news---article...) 
 Bacigalupi obviously thinks genetically modified foods are a threat. I'd say he's far more against them than I am. But, hey, it is entirely possible that Monsanto (oh, I mean AgriGen) could and would create genetically engineered crop plagues that would force industries worldwide to rely on their products. It's not the technology, it's about the use to which the technology is put. And, I suppose, if you believe that technology will never be put to its worst possible use, you have rosier view of human nature than either I or Bacigalupi has. There's an inevitability there... OK, I'm rambling. But, yay, seedbanks! Yay crop diversity! And yay, rambutans! 
 Go read this book. And then go read Pump Six. 
 Addendum: I think everyone should also read Apatt's review, https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."
5,"Very good!! As with all other Jen Turano books, I thoroughly enjoyed this! I am really loving these characters and can't wait to read Lucetta's story!"
4,"I was a huge Balthazar fan and was so excited when i found out Claudia was writing this. I'm glad to say it did not dissappoint. 
 The blurb reads: 
 For hundreds of years, the vampire Bathazar has been alone - without allies, without love. 
 When Balthazar agrees to help Skye Tierney, a human girl who once attended Evernight Academy, he has no idea how dangerous it will be. Skye's newfound psychic powers have caught the attention of Readgrave, the cruel, seductive master vampire responsible for murdering Balthazar and his family four centuries ago. Now Redgrave plans to use Skye's power for his own evil purposes. 
 Balthazar will do whatever it takes to stop Redgrave and exact his long-awaited revenge against his killer. As Skye and Balthazar stand together to fight him, they grow closer - first unwillingly, then undeniably. Bathazar realises his lonely world could finally be changed by her... 
 In a story filled with forbidden love and dark suspense, one of the most beloved characters in Claudia Gray's New York Times bestselling Evernight series will captivate readers with his batttle to overcome his past and follow his heart. 
 Balthazar is strong, loyal, kind and does everything he can to fight the monster inside. He does whatever it takes to protect Skye from the monster that turned him. He finds himself attracted to Skye, but has a 'no humans' rule. 
 I loved Skye, too. She was brave and smart and didn't do stupid things. She is lonely now that she is back at her old school, now her boyfriend dumped her and after the death of her brother. She has always been attracted to Balthazar, since their days at Evernight, and finds herself falling deeply for him now that he's always around to protect her. He is someone she can talk to, who can understand all the crazy things that are happening. 
 This is a beautiful romantic story, with some action too - she is being chased constantly by vampires after all. 
 My favourite scence was the one in the shower, you'll have to read for yourself to find out more. 
 I don't think you need to have read the Evernight series to read this. Oh, and Evernight fans will be pleased to know there are a few cameo apperances from other well loved characters in the Evernight series. 
 I recommand this for Balthazar fans, of course, people who like reading about Vampires trying to be good, or if you like a good YA romance. Even if you don't like vampires you may find yourself falling for this one."
3,"So for a free read I can't complain too much. It was so long without being too long. I didn't feel like I was reading an extremely long book nor did I feel bored that often. 
 The three stars represent that I was bored for a little bit at different parts. And because it wasn't what I was expecting. Which was good and bad, because I was surprised by twists and turns for the most part anyway. And the bad is I didn't want to read about a cult. Or new Eden. Which ever whom ever. Its a different take on shapeshifters and I can't grumble about that I just can't say I would reach for this book first above any other shapeshifter ones. 
 This being all said, I liked the characters for the most part. I do believe this could be a potentially interesting series and underrated one at that. Just this first book for me was a little rocky. I do think it could be great... just not sure its there yet..."
3,"A bit slow at times, but well-written. Also, predictable. I liked the 2 POVs of Elzabeth and Alice. And even though I predicted it, I was satisfied with the ending."
4,"This short story is only about 24 pages long. The remainder of the story is the first few chapters of, ""First Grave on the Right."""
4,"As I read a Gail Carriger book my posture becomes straighter, my grammar more precise, my sense of propriety more, well, proper. I drink coffee and wine, so tea does not become my drink of choice. In Heartless we are faced with a hugely pregnant, and therefore wholly inappropriate Alexia Tarabotti is the only person at the full moon standing between the Queen and danger. As usual Alexia has to get to bottom of it before the worst happens. On the way she learns a lot about the past of her and Connal's pack, too much about them actually. Then her hat and parasol maker, well, you have to read it to find out. 
 I really enjoyed this book. I think Gail Carriger has hit the nail on the head (i sincerely attempted to find a British idiom for this, but it turns out this is English in origin as early as 1438) with Heartless and regained the zing I thought missing from Changeless and Blameless. 
 Once again, Alexia flouts convention by actually going about her business and that of the Crown while immense with child and even during the full moon while the were and the vamps are otherwise occupied. You have to love someone who is practical: there's something that must be done and she's the only one for it. To hell with convention, Alixia's on the job! 
 The Vampires seem to be hell bent on the destruction of not only Alexia but her child. No werewolf Alpha is going to le t that happen but the enemies are many and inventive and Alexia has a habit of getting in trouble. The pack, and the military cannot watch her 24/7 so a solution must be negotiated. It is, of course because if she passed away the book would end suddenly. Of course, as always she is searching to learn more about her mysterious father, to find out more about her husband, and in general getting into trouble as only a person with no soul can. 
 Here is a little issue for me. Alexia has soul like Aretha Franklin playing the Apollo. Like the words, Sense and Sensibility with which the meaning is reversed so perhaps the Victorian's Soul had a different meaning. In her case it seems she doesn't pray to someone else when she is in trouble but depends on her wits. She would not be able to attend AA unless by Higher Power you mean Crown and Country. 
 Portrait of Jane Austen, from the memoir by J....Image via Wikipedia 
 What I feel returns the zing, is that there is less dependence on steampunk contrivances to move either Alexia or the story along than the last two novels. Of course, there are some but they do npt take over. Machines do not make good characters, Alexia does. Again the story depends on Alexia's intelligence and not, with a few exceptions involving personal dirigibles, Deus Ex Machina. Madame Lefoux is a source of problems and not a source of terribly helpful inventions. And Felicity, Alexia's maternal half-sister is being led not so much by her mother's stupidity but by a more Machiavellian sort. 
 Oh right, the baby. Well the baby comes as babies do. And is quite messy and unappealing at first. But for certain, just like the parents, this child has some special attributes. 
 Mayhem, as always follows Alexia through Victorian England, and that creates a rollicking hilarious frolic hrough Alexia's life and London. This is a MUST READ story for lovers of Steampunk, Victorian Vampires, or Werewolves, and maybe even lovers of Bridget Jones Diary and Jane Austen. For others it is probably Highly Recommended."

5,"One of the freshest, most exciting and addictive books I've read this year. It's the perfect blend of sweet and sexy, romantic and heartbreaking, funny and intense. 
 This book was such a wonderful surprise. I had no idea what to expect, but I reveled in book nirvana as I became engrossed in the addictive, frenzied push and pull between our two main characters. Bad Romeo was jam-packed with conflict, chemistry, sexual tension, humor and engaging dialogue. The story just pulled me in completely. I was so transfixed by the complicated dynamic of the characters, Cassie and Ethan. Through chapters which alternate between past and present, we experience how they fall in love... how their hearts fill and stretch and crack and long for each other over the years. Their love story is volatile, tumultuous and tremendously intense. Because undoubtedly, pair a brooding, enigmatic bad boy with a spirited but inexperienced good girl... and well, sparks will fly. 
 ""I don't think I ever truly knew the meaning of the word ""antagonize"" before I met him, but I sure as heck know now. I've never had someone rub me the wrong way so intensely before. If I'm being honest, I kind of like the spark."" 
 When Cassie Taylor lands a career-making theater project, she knows she needs to take it. Problem is, she'd be acting alongside the boy with whom she fell in love, the boy that was her first everything, the boy who shattered her heart in a way that had not yet healed. It had been three years since she'd seen Ethan Holt and she hated him. 
 ""Ethan Holt-the current ""It Boy"" of the theater world. So talented. Award-winner. Adored by screaming fans. Handsome as hell."" 
 Ethan and Cassie had met while in acting school, and immediately, it began antagonistically. But while gazes rife with hostility dueled, their chemistry was apparent and undeniable. Together, they were supercharged, whether it be in a turmoil of animosity or the throes of repressed desire. Cassie wanted Ethan, but Ethan seemed to push her away constantly, even though his words and actions indicated otherwise. 
 ""We just don't mesh. It's like we're oil and vinegar. No matter how much we shake each other up, we're never going to blend."" 
 Cassie is a girl who is riddled with insecurities. She's never confident enough to stand her ground or voice her true opinion in front of others. She fears being discounted and ignored, yet with Ethan, she can't help but say what she feels. She's assertive, opinionated, honest and unyielding, engaging in a fierce verbal warfare that only further fuels their chemistry. And even though Cassie seems to break though to Ethan in a way no other can, she doesn't know what to make of his behavior. Does he want her or not? And how much more of his vacillating ways can she take? 
 ""We're like these giant magnets that keep flipping over and over again, pulling each other in, then pushing away."" 
 But just as the shields weaken for Ethan, and Cassie gives him a chance, he takes everything and betrays her in a way that cut deeply. 
 ""I tried to convince myself I wanted nothing from you and ended up losing everything."" 
 I love that this novel is almost like two stories entwined. One is the coming-of-age story where these two people meet and fall in love. Their time together is filled with heartache and strife. Ethan is anything but romantic. He's mean and cantankerous and entirely confusing. Cassie is insecure and love stricken. Together they are, in actuality, a romantic tragedy. Two star-crossed lovers too impassioned to make it work. The second part of the story is an emotional second chance romance, brimming with regret and longing and supplication. Ethan is not the same person he once was and neither is Cassie. Their roles reverse to some extent and their future teeters on Cassie's ability to trust Ethan. 
 I also love the title of the book, which I think is applicable in multiple ways. Ethan is everything a ""leading"" man is not. He doesn't do romance. He doesn't do relationships. He's unapologetically arrogant and unyielding. He also told her from the very beginning that he would be bad for her, a truth Cassie learned the hard way. Ethan Holt is truly a bad Romeo who has broken Juliet. 
 Overall, Bad Romeo just felt so different and fresh. It had great dialogue, bold characters, perfect pacing and an engaging framework built upon an interesting theater backdrop. I loved how she explored the richness of opposing forces, blurring lines between love/hate, true selves/facades, desire/antagonism, attraction/repulsion, chemistry on-stage/off, future possibilities/past demons. It's difficult to believe this is her debut novel, as it's ingeniously crafted and so well written. For all those reasons mentioned above and many more, this is one of the must reads of the year and absolutely one of my most favorite. I LOVED IT! 
 ""...as much as I used to think you were better off without me, you're not. You need me just as much as I need you. We're both hollow without the other, and it's taken me a long time to realize that.""

5,"Loved this almost as much as 'Painted Faces' (which I highly recommend). 
 Six of Hearts has a very original and interesting plot--loved that it was set in Ireland, loved that the hero, Jay, was an illusionist, and loved getting to ""see"" a bunch of his tricks! Jay was a sometimes-broody, mysterious, caring, dirty-talking, super-hot alpha as well, and I REALLY loved that (I expected to see smoke coming from my kindle in a couple of spots!) 
 Can't wait to see what L.H. Cosway comes up with next!"
2,"Average historical fiction. Set in 1899, the wealthy Earl of Dilberne is in financial difficulties and the obvious solution is to marry his son and heir to an American heiress in search of a title. Very similar to Downton Abbey and Upstairs, Downstairs (the author was one of the creators of the latter show) this book is very arch and sneering and lacks the television shows' warmth and sympathetic characters. This is a short novel and the first in a trilogy. 
 The audio book narrator did an excellent job with the characters although her version of the pushy American rube mother reminded me a lot of Kathy Bates as Molly Brown in the movie version of Titanic."
5,"The wretched irony of this book is one of the most heartbreaking concepts of it. Sibohan Dowd, a woman so talented, so creative, with an incredible idea, a perfect vision, something so true... Unable to finish it. 
 Cancer. It took away her chance to finish the book, took away her life from her family and her friends. 
 But it was also the thing that made this book famous, the thing that gave this book its story. 
 How horrible I feel to think it, how completely selfish it makes me, I have to admit that without cancer, she wouldn't have been able to so fully and beautifully create this book, this unexplainable feeling within it, this story that will last in all of us who read it. 
 Patrick Ness, one of my most worshipped authors, took up the unfinished project of A Monster Calls, writing something with the sole purpose of hoping he could create something that Sibohan would have approved of. 
 Hope. 
 Hope is something Patrick Ness understands. His trilogy, Chaos Walking, was created from a foundation of hope, the hope that what's at the end of the road is better than what you're running from, the hope at the very end of the last book, that made you the only one to decide what you hoped the ending really was, what made you write the last page yourself. 
 It's all reflected here. And reading this book without it would be a curse upon yourself. Hope is all Conor has. 
 Ness and Dowd. 
 His talent, his vision, his hope, mixed with her idea, her unimaginable experiences. That is what this book is. 
 Bless them both. And may Sibohan Dowd rest in peace. 
 Edit: June 2012 
 Ironic that, months after reading this book, I am diagnosed with cancer. 
 Its a benign tumor, but since it is located in a part of my brain that could be harmed by even the most delicate surgical methods, I'll be going through proton therapy soon. The book means much more to me now, needless to say. I actually had my mother reading it on the day we went in to get the MRI that would give us the bad news. 
 She finished it right in front of me just before they called us in to tell us that there was a tumor in the direct center of my brain, putting so much pressure on it that my brain no longer pulsed. 
 Oddly enough, I didn't cry that day. Maybe because I read this book, maybe because I knew that it wouldn't be as bad as many others with cancer much worse than this. 
 Either way, this book holds a special place in my heart now."
4,"Raunchy graphic novel. I'm still trying to process this but I kinda loved it. It unabashedly talks about sex & puberty & growing up. It's different than I thought it would be & not in a bad way. 
 Full review to follow. (April 22 2016)"

4,"This one was not as amazing as the first book in the series, but then, it's hard to maintain the surprise of a solid start while keeping continuity. And by the end, I was totally on board again. Actually, when the Games began, I was back to breathless eagerness to find out what would happen next. I'm taking the three star beginning and the five star ending and calling it four stars. 
 This series reminds me very much of Six of Crows. There's no mimicry or ripping off between the two, but they share rich world-building, glorious anti-heros, and a group of central characters who have all had to grow up fast. I think the characters from both series would work well together, although there'd be a lot of jockeying for position."
5,"Coming from a high expectations family, Annabelle is overshadowed by her successful brothers and her mother is constantly nagging at her about doing something with her life. Annabelle's no stranger to failure and she's determined to make her matchmaking business inherited from her Nana the best in town. Luckily for her, her friend Molly is the wife of star quarterback Kevin Tucker who's friends with one of the best sports agents in town, who also happens to be a bachelor. Sealing a deal with the intimidating Heath Champion will surely solidify her profession. But he's already got Portia of Power Matches under contract, surely he doesn't need a rookie to set him up. Can Annabelle prove him wrong? 
 Match Me If You Can was a delightful chick lit! I knew I would love Annabelle from the start! She's positive and motivated, despite her track record of failed ventures. I would pay anything for her matchmaking services! Heath's career driven and has high expectations for everything, including his wife. He wants to be married before 35, but he's certainly a picky fellow and that doesn't make Annabelle's job easy. The two clash at first and you wonder how they could even attract each other! The progression of their relationship was so natural, you'll be left wondering when they fell for each other. If you love romantic comedies, pick this one up!"
4,"I'm not a big fan of Stephen King, but I liked this novel. It was well-written, with likable main character and very good desciptions of the monster and its gruesome murders, without being cheesy or over-the-top. The strongest point was the atmosphere - chilling and cosy in the same time. The illustrations of Berni Wrightson were quite spectacular, too."
2,"I was VERY disappointed in this book. It seems that Robinson had some bits of knowledge in his head that he wanted to get out, and in doing so, lost the structure and meaning of the book. Some faults: 
 - The science, while in places was outstanding, was conveniently forgotten in places. Worse than that, the engineering knowledge was non-existent or poor, which jarred against the very detailed technical scientific explanations. There were tent cities made out of a clear plastic that could be cut by a knife, yet these things NEVER tore, except when convenient to the author. The structures and cities involved were poorly designed and just did not make sense most of the time. Why build a city with huge transparent windows when 15 pages ago, you mentioned how deadly the radiation was??? Ugh. 
 - I didn't care for most of the characters. They were either boring, or 2 dimensional, or were telling a story I didn't give a crap about. The only memorable section for me was the ""John"" section, where there was a real story with real plot development. Other sections were SO focused on theoretical science, theoretical politics, and (bad) theoretical engineering that it was tedious. 
 - HUGE stretches of book with little to no dialog. Again, there was so much focus on the stuff above, it left little interaction between characters. Some people say Mars was the biggest character in the book, but it was just a sandbox for Robinson to play around in."
5,"i am soooo happy i took a chance on this. i loved it. i loved Logan.i loved Kit. i loved Paul, Matt, Pete and Sam. even loved Abby and Ford! and Friday. i loved all of them and everything about them. the cherry on top of this? definitely Haley, hands down. 
 for me, this was a one-sitting read. once i picked it up, i couldn't put down. 
 i think the characters were very well developed, seeing as Logan and Kit have special... abilities? i don't know if that's the correct word, but i don't know how else to say it, either. 
 other thing i really loved? (view spoiler)[Emily's mom. i was afraid she was going to be one of those up tight bitches, but nope she wasn't. apparently she grew a backbobne for her daughter -better late than never, right?- and i loved it. (hide spoiler)]"
5,"What... what just HAPPENED!?!?! 
 Please excuse me, while I recover from this aweosme case of whiplash and emotional roller coaster I just can't seem to get off. 
 A few hours later.... *UPDATE* 
 I'm still a little unstable. But I'm gonna give this a go. 
 When I found this on my kindle, (early!) I busted out my awesome, happy dance (which I save for 
 very 
 special occasions) earning myself, ODD looks from the people around me. Which made me smile.. AND..dance some more. 
 Annnnnyway. 
 I'm not going to bore you with a run down of this book. Becaaaause: 
 A.) There's a lot to talk about. 
 B.) If you've read the other books in the series.. you're not gonna care because you're gonna read it anyway. 
 I loved pretty much EVERYTHING. I felt every.single.emotion while reading this. I love how Jennifer can write a beautiful, sweet moment, without RUINING it with humor and banter, but making it work. (And there are A LOT of sweet moments.) Daemon and Katy... *sign* their relationship is so, so sweet. I could go on and on gushing about. And Dawson... oh, how may heart broke for you. 
 However. There are a few things going on that I just felt kinda.. I don't know... OFF about. THE MAIN ONE- Blake. (OR Mr. McCreepy) That.. that snake! I understand the WHY (kinda) but.. but.. he's just a !!!!! (view spoiler)[ I mean, WTH. Was that his game plan the ENTIRE TIME!? Was he really working with THEM? I just can't wrap my head around it! AND CARISSA. W.T.F! What was the point??? someone, pleeeeeeease explain that tidbit because I felt that was COMPLETELY unnecessary. Maybe it'll be explained... (hide spoiler)] All this wasn't irritating enough to knock some stars off. Just more like a .. 
 ""O-kaaaaaaaaaay, WTH"" 
 And the ending. 
 OH.MY.GOSH 
 the ending. I was chanting ""no, no no, no no no, nononononono"" the ENTIRE LAST THREE PAGES! seriously, mother of ALL cliff hangers.. 
 ALL IN ALL my friends, this installment was seriously fanfreakingtastic! NOW, I am offically dyinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnng for the next book."
3,"I heard some good things about this book and it intrigued me so I picked it up. The story gripped me within the first 10 pages! I was HOOKED! And then at about page 45 Audra started acting like a psycho and Vane started being a love sick puppy. 
 Um, WHAT?! 
 Why are these characters so plain? I mean, don't get me wrong, I still liked the story, and I was able to stomach all the Vane puns and him trying to get at Audra on practically every other page but seriously? ...moving on... 
 The thing that infuriated me the most is the fact that the publisher didn't feel the need to enlighten me that this is BOOK ONE OF A SERIES! If I knew that, I wouldn't have picked it up to read as a stand alone. Now I have to wait two more years to find out what happens to there predictable star crossed lovers? Well damn..."
5,"This was my first proper m/m in a while and I truly enjoyed it! I didn't hesitate to pick this baby up because I've fallen in love with Henry the first time he appeared in The Fall Up. And I have no doubt his story won't disappoint me. 
 It didn't hurt that Aly Martinez's writing was so freaking hilarious too. 
 ""Shit. I really wish you would just find a nice gay guy and settle down."" 
 I gasped, dramatically slapping my hand against the seat beside me, the other clenching my heart. ""Did you hear that, Macy?"" I whispered, never tearing my eyes off him. 
 She sucked in a shocked breath. ""You're right. He totally adores you."" 
 Batting my lashes, I allowed false tears to pool in my eyes. Then I made a show of quivering my chin. ""I...I love you too, Papa."" 
 ""Jesus fucking Christ. Forget I said anything,"" he grumbled. 
 ~*~*~ 
 ""Can I at least grab my shit and check out, your highness?"" 
 ""Mmm,"" I purred, rubbing my shoulder with his. ""I approve of the new pet name. But sorry. Your request is denied."" I grinned then yelled to the driver, ""Sally forth, noble steed."" 
 ""Wow,"" Evan deadpanned as we pulled away. 
 ""Trust me. He gets worse,"" Carter added. 
 I hope I can binge read all of Aly Martinez's book but, Alas, reality decided to show up and slap me in the face."
3,"This is a cute, fun, fast book! Nothing heavy here, but a nice little escape."
4,"I'm going to go 3.5 on this one. I really enjoyed it. I loved Greta as a heroine. The dichotomy between her prickly exterior and her vulnerable thoughts was well done. I also liked her conflicted feelings about Isaac and thought their romance was pretty swoony. Anyone who likes romance in YA should love this one. 
 However, the book wasn't without its flaws. I wish we had gotten to know some of the characters better (Siona or the faerie bounty hunter, for example). I wish the mythology of some of the creatures and aspects of Mylena had been expanded on in this book instead of relying on a trilogy (I'm assuming this will be a trilogy) to flesh things out. The events leading up to the end seemed to happen so fast that I wasn't able to muster quite enough caring. 
 But the one thing I had the most problem with was (view spoiler)[Wyatt having ""real"" feelings for Greta. That happened so fast and I felt it was completely unnecessary. I think it might have been more interesting if he was just lusting after her because she was the first girl he'd seen in a long time, or something like that. (hide spoiler)]. 
 Even with that complaint, this was a surprisingly good read with one of the best YA heroines I've ever come across. I look forward to the rest of this series."
2,"Narrator #1 can't have kids. Narrator #2 has a baby. Narrator #3 is expecting one. Am I missing something? Oh, yeah. A narcopath. Recipe for disaster. 
 There's literally nothing to take away from this book other than what everyone already knows. What's that you ask? Here it is. CRAZY PEOPLE DO CRAZY THINGS. 
 The Girl on the Train was a load of twaddle. It's absolutely DEPRESSING to read. The women are DEPRESSING. The whole whodunnit mystery, which you can EASILY figure out if you know elementary math (common denominator in these women's lives), is DEPRESSING. 
 I HATE unreliable narration with a burning passion. It's the bane of my reading existence. I hated it in Gone Girl. I hated it in The Girl on the Train. I don't want to be lied to so I can be kept in the dark and then be thrown a ""twist"". Keep me on my toes the smart way, not the convenient way."
3,"This could have been such a fun book. I liked the premise but it fell short for me. I found myself just wanting something interesting to happen but every time I thought there would be some action, it just fell short. This is the first Ally Carter book I've read and I'm going to give her other books a try, especially since everyone raves about them."
1,"I don't even know where to start with this review. Wait, yeah I do. Authors, please do your research before writing a book. Pretty please....with sugar on top. I spent the entire book saying ""Wait, that's not how that works"" and ""there is no way the military would ever allow that to happen"" and even ""I'm not a hacker and even I know that's not how that goes"". Needless to say, I found countless things in this book that just a little bit of research on the author's part would have had her backing off the totally screwed up plot line of this book. I'll highlight them as I walk you through Black Dawn. Prepare yourself because this is one of those reviews where my inner bitch comes out. 
 This is a book about Lexi AKA Silverchaos, a famous hacker, who has found a security hole in a social media site that caters to military members and their families. Lexi has written code that will either fix and/or exploit the hole. She offered the code to the company to purchase and if they didn't, she was going to auction it off to the highest bidder. Basically she was trying to blackmail the company into purchasing the code. They declined so she set up an auction. Her code would give it's new owner access to all the data the social media site kept like names, ages, credit cards, family, locations, etc. All this is perfectly legal of course, according to this book. 
 Issue 1: This kind of hacking will get you arrested in the US (and should!). 
 Issue 2: Really, a social media website that caters to military families that not only asks for family info like names, locations, jobs, etc. but also has spouses giving out rank, locations etc. Not going to happen. 
 Issue 3: The author knew just enough about coding to get herself into trouble. Some of the things she came up with could actually be plausible but... View Spoiler >> 
 Issue 4: I'm not even going to go into everything that was wrong with the horrid, coughing, tearing up, gagging, death by exhaust fumes from the brand new Mercedes scene. 
 Let's talk about the heroine, Lexi. She was a hacker who purposely exploited a security hole in a social media site and made targets out of the families of the men and women who fight and die for our country. I mean seriously, what the hell did this woman think was going to happen when she put that shizzle up for auction? She knew it left those families vulnerable because she talks about it. 
 Needless to say, I completely disliked this book. I actually have a couple of other books in this series I was looking forward to reading since they got great reviews, even from some of my DG's. If this is the kind of non-attention to detail that I can expect, I'll pass. 
 Laurie's Rating: 1/2 Star since I can't really give it 0 stars. 
 I received a complimentary copy of this book from the Publisher in exchange for an honest review.

3,"This was a little disappointing after the promising start in the first book. I enjoy Redd as a villian but Arch just annoyed me and the plot with him was more prominent. I still like it enough to finish out the trilogy, though."
5,"I'm so happy. I don't think I need to say anything else. Marissa wrote this with a real plot and a good plot and I don't feel like she just wanted all my money. I would for sure have given it to her anyway. But even so this novel was amazing. And the art...I love how it's abstract enough that it doesn't change my imaginings of the characters but they also capture them and are recognizable. Winter's hair...and why is bluescale Thorne so attractive? 
 The story was funny and engaging and every moment felt believable to The Lunar Chronicles. I'm so happy that Marissa Meyer is just as much a fangirl as we are."
3,"I ended up reading this in a day. It was very cute. It has been a really long time since I've picked up a Kinsella book, and I just automatically wanted to read this when I read that she was releasing a new book, not even knowing that it was going to be a YA read. 
 Audrey is a fourteen year old girl who has been suffering from social anxiety due to a really traumatic situation involving the mean girls of her school. She has been going to a psychiatrist and is slowly starting to heal herself. But the prospect of returning to school, (even if it is a new one and a year below) is truly paralyzing to her, as she still has trouble leaving the house. She also wears dark sunglasses everywhere because she still finds it difficult to make true eye contact with a person. 
 All the while this is happening, Audrey's parents are also trying to deal with her older brother, Frank. He is a very smart young man who also happens to love playing LOC, an RPG online. His mother in particular, with the help of The Daily Mail jumps to the worst possible conclusion, that Frank is addicted and probably can't even tell the difference between real life and fantasy anymore. 
 The family dynamic in this book is fantastic. It is what really sold the book for me. The mother and father are hilarious as they try and work together to understand their kids and try to outsmart them. The family scenes were really reminiscent to me of the Louise Rennison books. Some really laugh out loud stuff. 
 The book is touching and funny and really heart warming. The reason I didn't rate it any higher is because I thought it was a bit unrealistic with Audrey's progress and state of mind. I think it is a great way of getting the word out there about the stigma of mental illness, but I really thought that adding a love interest and having her to suddenly be able to leave the house on her own to meet said love interest was a bit too rushed. Perhaps if this book were longer it might have made a little more sense, but not a lot of time elapses through the quick read, and when we first meet Audrey she is no where near to independently walking to her neighborhood Starbucks."
4,"I have to say I really enjoyed this book. It was extremely heartwarming and as I have recently become a big fan of baking, I appreciated the recipes at the start of each chapter. It was a nice touch. Normally I hate children in books, I hate the way they exaggerate the 'baby talk' but I found Louis to be really funny with his admonishing of 'Caline' for her bad cake! And Darny was hilarious."
3,"To be honest, by the third book I was mainly reading to see what would happen to Peeta, or to see what new imaginative ways the author could devise to kill or torture the characters. You have to ask yourself at some point whether or not she hates everyone she is writing about. I understand it's a dystopian novel, but at some point it becomes a bit much. 
 I found Katniss really hard to like as a protagonist, partly because her reaction to any situation was to kill something or someone, partly because she seems so cold, and partly because as the series goes on she just seems to become more and more self-pitying and judgmental of others, despite the fact that everyone else is suffering as much, if not MORE, than she is. And no matter how many times she comes to the realization that she's being insensitive or self-centered or intolerant, or worries that she's a cold calculating person, she never seems to make any effort to stop acting this way."
5,"What can I say. This book was just awesome. I cried for most of the part and smiled at the rest of the part. A emotional drama which will get to all watery eye with a smile at the end. 
 Everyone has some shit to shovel and that's what this book is about. No one is perfect and perfection is impossible that's what the message this book delivers. 
 A book with a inspirational message. This is the first book of the series and I can't wait to read the rest of the parts. 
 The characters are pretty much well explained. I really liked a lot whenever the little angel appread. The thoughts of angel were just awesome. The ending was kind of rushed off especially the last chapter. 
 Last verdict : Its a killer romance with mature characters instead of teeny whinny characters like few other books. I really enjoyed it would recommend for anyone who likes romance with mature characters"

 There is a sub genre, I guess you'd call it, called M/M. Which is a romance where both characters are men. My only previous exposure to this type of story is Suzanne Brockmann's book ""All Through the Night."" Of all her Troubleshooters books, this was my favorite because my love for Jules knows no bounds. Other than that, though, I've never really read M/M. I didn't know much about it or the authors, so I never really tried it. One of my fellow bloggers (Lori) kept going on and on the other day about this one series of books she was reading. The Cut & Run series by Abigail Roux and Madeleine Urban. All right. I'll give them a try. I picked up the first book on January 5. 7 days and 7 books* later, I'm wondering when the next book comes out! (April 8 according to Goodreads). I'll have you know I was up until sunrise nearly every day this week reading these books. 
 The first four books were co-written by Abigail Roux & Madeleine Urban, and, honestly, they write together well enough that there is a seamless transition between the books written jointly and those solely written by Ms. Roux. 
 Ty and Zane are FBI agents assigned to work together to catch a serial killer in New York. When we first meet them Ty is irreverent, headstrong, and a rule breaker, while Zane is buttoned-up, Mr. By-the-Book, and will absolutely not do anything to get himself in trouble. Things change, though, as we learn more about these two. Oh, don't get me wrong. Ty is still irreverent, headstrong, and a total rule breaker, but he's also brave both with his body and his heart. He's kind and loving and romantic. Zane is the one who surprised me. As we learn more about Zane we find he HATES being a buttoned-up Mr. By-the-Book, but he feels he has to be, as he's on shaky ground with his career. 
 Watching these two fall for each other and fight it all the way was fascinating. Because both main characters are male, there's a whole different dynamic at play with the two of them. They're rougher and more physical than a Hero would ever be with a Heroine. But at the same time, there's more fear there due to the inherent problems of being gay in today's society. Do they come out to their friends? their coworkers? their families? What happens if they're rejected by those around them? What if they each can't deal with their relationship and one rejects the other? 
 My biggest complaint, and it was resolved eventually, is that there is more emotional game playing with these two than I would like. A lot of unwillingness to trust. In a more traditional romance, ""I love you's"" would have happened in book 1, and while I might have preferred it a LITTLE earlier, I think Ms. Urban and Ms. Roux really were true to the characters by making them work things out. Slowly. In fact, one says ""I love you"" far earlier (as in an earlier book) than the other. No, I won't tell you who. That's half the fun! 
 Once they start working through their emotions and really commit to each other, however, their trust is absolute and they are strong and supportive of each other at every step. They've made a pact to be more honest with each other and really TALK about things, especially things from their pasts. I enjoyed that the conflicts they face rarely come from within the relationship, but are external forces (murderers, thieves, cats, puns). 
 I'm so happy I listened to Lori and Pam and read these books. They were absolutely right and the books were totally worth the lack of sleep. I'll be on the lookout for more, both in the series and from the authors. 
 *There are actually only 6 books in the series right now, but on Pam's recommendation I read Warrior's Cross between books 4 & 5 as some of those characters play a large role in book 5. More on that book another day.

4,Loved it!
3,"This is a good book. It's well written and characterized, and handles some tough subjects in a raw way. It just isn't the type of book that resonates with me emotionally."
3,"Before the Fall is a well written story, a private plane crashes, the only adult survivor is a poor painter, a recovered alcoholic that never succeeded in life. He is saving the four year old boy of the super rich, 9 digits of dollars worth couple. In a heroic, almost impossible act, he swam ten miles to the shore, with one non-functioning shoulder and the child. 
 Scott, the painter, almost missed the flight. He made it there in the last minute just to get to the closing doors, with a large duffle bag. Many other characters weren't angels themselves and had some backstory with a secret and a not-so-great situation before they boarded the small aircraft. The story is aftermath of the crash and concentrates mostly on the backstories of the passengers and crew members. What caused the terrible accident, if it was an accident, is unclear and being investigated. 
 The biggest problem is that it is too much aftermath and too little actually happening. The ""show not tell"" is missing in this book. The story goes back and forth for most of the characters, so the storyline is not a linear one, and it is not naturally flowing because of these jumps in the timeline. After a few of these, I got a bit tired. 
 It started really well, I loved Scott's struggling as an artist, he's growing up story from an immature youngster to a mature adult. It also takes journalistic ethics to the extreme, what would a tv person do and how far they would go for a good story? But for the most part the characters fell into a traditional male-female world, which made me feel uncomfortable. 
 Overall, almost 3 stars, because of the writing."
5,"MY INNER FANGIRL WAS SCREAMING SO MANY TIMES THROUGHOUT THIS BOOK! 
 Okay, just had to get that off my chest. 
 I LOVED this book. I loved everything about it; the sarcasm, the cursing, the characters and the world. 
 It was hilarious and I often had to bite my tongue to not laugh in public while I read, but I still ended up grinning like an idiot. 
 The cursing just added to the scenes and dialoges in a funny way, and I myself curse some (obviously not all the time...) so I loved it. And ""Fuck nine-toed trolls""? That one was good. 
 Baz and Simon [?] 
 I was practically just waiting for Snow to realize what Baz already knew. And when it finally happened I couldn't stop fangirling. They are the best together and the cutest and everything was just right. The fact that they wanted to kill each other for the past years, and plotted each other's deaths while sharing a room, without ever knowing that they were meant for each other was funny and painful. It was so heartwarming when they realized that they loved each other, and had done it for years (at least Baz). And I loved that they kept teasing and being mean to one another even after they became a thing. 
 Baz was just this badass guy, so fucking cool in every situation even though he was shaking on the inside. And Simon was all over the place, but he was funny and easy to love, and did whatever he could to protect his friends. 
 When it came to Simon, Baz was so tender and loving and caring, and not his usual cold self. My heart practically melted because of that. 
 It's so weird when I think of it, because reading Fangirl I wasn't particularly enjoying the Simon-Baz story. It wasn't before the end of Fangirl that I started liking it, and then I read Carry on and my world collapsed. I have this feeling in my gut, the feeling you have after you've finished a really good book and you don't know what to do with your life anymore. 
 This book was really something for me, I absolutely adored every single page"
5,"I am sobbing 
 Ok, now I've finished crying..... There's not many books that can get me like this one did. I do sometimes shed a tear but not the ugly, snotty, bawling sobbing I did over the last 70 pages or so of this. 
 I usually read HEA and wished the ending could be different for Lou's sake, but, if the book was written from Will's POV, I'm sure I would be happy with the way it did finish. 
 Life is cruel sometimes"
5,"OMG! 
 But who do I support now? Which guy do I want Merit with? And OMG the world has turned upside down in this one!"
4,"A wonderful story of a young girls struggle after a comet hits earth. 
 The autism is portrayed excellently and sensitively, the plot is engrossing and tense. 
 The only downside for me was I would have liked more information about the spaceship, I understand there is a sequel so may we will learn more."
5,"Originally posted at: Blue Sky Bookshelf 
 First line: There was a boy in her room. 
 I love this book. I have written and rewritten this introduction who knows how many times because I simply cannot find the words to express how much I fell in love with this book. So I'll simply leave it at ""I love this book."" 
 We meet Cath. Unlike her twin sister Wren, she's antisocial and way nerdier. Both of them have enjoyed fanfiction--Simon Snow fanfiction to be exact--but Cath took it way farther. Her life was revolved around writing the stuff, even doing it so long that it made my butt hurt just thinking about how long she was sitting. 
 What I really loved about Cath is that she embraces her geeky life. Some might say that she embraces it too much, but Rowell writes her in a way that it just made me love her even more. Unless you have never been fanatical about something which is so against human nature, are you a robot?, then you can relate to Cath. While I have never associated with fanfiction (we'll get to that later), I have been so personally invested in some form of entertainment that I easily connected with her. 
 So there's Cath, who not only is being thrown into the scary world of college with a new roommate and experiencing separation anxiety from her sister and her unstable father, but then you add in the potentially lethal element of boys. 
 ...Cath kept noticing things. 
 Boys. 
 Guys. 
 Everywhere. 
 She doesn't understand them (another thing we connect on) because, hey, she barely understands people. What's amazing is that even in third person, Rowell manages for me to feel what Cath is feeling and sympathize with her on a level that's hard for authors to do even in first person. She's confused. Wary. Suspicious. Vulnerable. They're a mix of emotions that I had no problem connecting with and giggling at as she tries to wade through all the situations in her life. 
 ""Look..."" Cath said. ""I can't just let strange guys into my room. I don't even know your name. This whole situation is too rapey."" 
 ""Rapey?"" 
 ""You understand,"" she said, ""right?"" 
 He dropped an eyebrow and shook his head, still smiling. ""Not really. But now I don't want to come in with you. The word 'rapey' makes me uncomfortable."" 
 And we meet Reagan. She was one of my favorite characters, providing humor and snark. After they ignored each other, Reagan decides to help a pathetic sister out by bringing her into the real world. 
 ""I feel sorry for you, and I'm going to be your friend."" 
 ""I don't want to be your friend,"" Cath said as sternly as she could. ""I like that we're not friends."" 
 ""Me, too,"" Reagan said. ""I'm sorry you ruined it by being so pathetic."" 
 Reagan was actually like Cath in the way of people. Even though Cath was socially awkward and therefore, did not want to be around people, Reagan just didn't like people. I love people, I do, but I felt like I was a mix of them both. Similar to Cath, I always/usually sometimes would rather be with my beloved fictional characters than people and like Reagan, I also just look at people and think, ""Why do I have to be around you?"" 
 Wren was sporadically absent, but that was fine with me because less Wren meant more Reagan. And with Reagan comes the charming Levi. I have so many wonderful amazing, swoony, did I say amazing? quotes for him, but really, they're best when you read them as you're reading from the book, in context. 
 I never understood fanfiction before. I always judged it as someone being lazy or even to the point of being rude. That's someone else's work, characters, and setting. Why are you messing with it? But I thank Rowell because I see the pull of fanfiction through Cath's eyes. She explained it in the book that she fully believes that they're the author's characters, she won't take credit, and she doesn't seek money from her fanfiction. Instead, it's her way to manipulate her favorite characters, to play a what-if scenario on her terms. I mean, who doesn't sometimes imagine how your favorite book should have turned out? Ahem, Mockingjay. 
 Verdict: An outstanding book that most definitely lives up to all the hype."
5,Allie Brosh is one of my favorite internet people.
5,Love Kate. Love this original world building. It's a perfect urban paranormal. I read through the whole series up to date without stopping.
3,"I am on the fence on this one. There was parts I thoroughly enjoyed, then there was parts that made me feel stupid because I had absolutely no idea what was being said, let alone what was going on. 
 But I am still giving it 3 stars as the author did tell a good story, but just too technical for me at times."
5,"4.5 Stars 
 This book! Oh this book! It is so my kind of story. Flirty, funny, sexy. Best friends to more? Gets me EVERY TIME! I wish it never ended."
2,"I liked the idea of using a monster inspired by Beowulf, but apart from that detail both the overall setting and the supernatural agency set-up felt generic. 
 That wouldn't have been a huge problem for me if the characters were more compelling, but Makenna and company all suffered from a bad case of ""root for us because we're the heroes of the story."" I couldn't push myself into caring about her at all, and she had no sense of chemistry with the other folks in the book. 
 Mac's background and supposed skill set didn't always match her actions, and her employers came off as incompetent. (They somehow had a policy against training their monster-spotters for fighting monsters.) The plot's ticking clock wasn't as big a deal as it ought to have been either, because it was obvious that the villains wouldn't accomplish their reveal. So the stakes were basically about whether Mac would gain the respect of her coworkers, making it less than satisfying considering that I didn't like Mac. 
 Lisa Shearin is a good writer with an interesting, distinctive style. But these characters don't spark like the leads of her fantasy books, so I hope she moves on to other projects soon."
3,"3 stars 
 audiobook : 4.5 stars ... I liked the voice of the narrator it was like movie listening to it 
 I was in the mood of something romance and I wanted something that I knew I will enjoy it so I chose this because I enjoyed "" beautiful disaster "" it was a good one but this I don`t know and I still hate Abby so much 
 so this is the second book in the series where the story is from the point of view of Trav and there was not any new things in it except the prologue and may be the epilogue I DON`T REMEMBER IT IN THE FIRST ONE >> but I enjoyed it 
 I really want a story for their twin during their collage life ... I know I will enjoy espically the character of their daughter 
 I MUST ME MORE PICKY NEXT TIME WHEN I CHOOSE ROMANCE"
3,"I listened to the audio book on my commute this week, and it was enjoyable. I can't say I was wowed by it, but that might have been because of the format, or because I had just read another Jennifer E Smith book that took place over the course of a single night. Solid 3.5 stars."
3,"The first half is quite full of interesting facts and well told stories but after that it kind of becomes less relevant, repetitive and boring."
3,"3.0 out of 5 stars Evil is as evil does..., July 3, 2009 
 This review is from: Evil at Heart (Hardcover) 
 This is the third in the ""heart"" series about Gretchen Lowell, the ""Beauty Killer"" who has become so notorious that there are tours, web sites and fan clubs set up in her honor. Previous titles include Heartsick and Sweetheart. 
 What's her claim to this fame? She has kidnapped, tortured, and murdered many men and women through the years -- her most infamous escapade involved the near killing and then the saving of a cop who was on the task force formed to hunt her down -- Archie Sheridan. Yes, this was over two years ago, but Gretchen has escaped and is once again murdering -- or is she? Are these victims that bear her signature really recent attempts by Gretchen to resume her ways, or is this a copycat crime spree? 
 This series, more about the relationship between Gretchen and Archie than it is about solving the crimes, seems to me to be about played out. Archie has been reduced to a shell of his former self and, although he's returned to the police department, he's a psychological mess. I do appreciate that he's off the drugs and trying to get free of his Stockholm-like addiction to his captor. Gretchen is as heinous as ever, although she's not in this book as much. 
 Lots of description of vile torture and murder with gruesome details. Definitely not for the squeamish. It was interesting enough, but I'm hopeful that Chelsea Cain will move in a new direction and go beyond the Hannibal Lecter/Clarice Starling similarities. 
 The story seems rather anticlimactic and there's not much suspense or mystery, however, I'm sure most fans who read the previous two (and you should do that before you read this one) will want the ""rest of the story"" and will buy this book."
3,"*This book was given in exchange for an honest review and contains spoilers* 
 Fire was a unique book set in a unique fantasy world. I really enjoyed the idea of 4 different realms that have powers from the 4 elements. I thought it was interesting to see all the ways the people imitated their chosen element. I thought the characters were well-developed. I really like Brae, he was thoughtful and kind. He was also a strong characters and I liked how he was willing to be open-minded. I did feel bad that he left Helion thinking that Roxy had betrayed him. I did enjoy Roxy as well, she had a ton of spunk and wasn't afraid to live. I also enjoyed that she wanted to be the best Protector and spent so much time training. Jazz was tougher for me because while I really understood and empathized with her character, I also felt like she was the least-likeable character. I understood her pain at not knowing where she comes from, but I also felt like she took it too far. Plus, it's obvious to me that Roxy and Jazz are half sisters. Roxy's dad was part of the Brizan occupation, he stayed there for months and the Brizan queen was reportedly extraordinarily beautiful, and he looked shocked when he saw Jazz. Also, Jazz had incidents using both water and fire powers, she has brown hair(Helion) and blue eyes(Brizan), and her hair is violet. Violet being a mix of blue hair(Brizan) and red hair(Helion), I can't wait for the next installment to see if I'm right! The only thing that keeps me from giving this book 4 or 5 stars, is the fact that it was hard to get into. I was more than 25% through it by the time I started to catch on to the elements and the differences between all the different realms. I also felt that the dual point of view was part of the reason it was hard to get into. It just switched to quickly and just as I would start to get invested into a character it would switch over to a different point of view. I would still recommend this book because it ended up being a great novel and I can't wait for the sequel!"
4,"A note: This review is going to be a bit vague because I really, really, reallyreally don't want to spoil this book for anyone. Because oh my gosh.... 
 A note on the note: This review really is going to be vague unlike all my other 'vague' reviews which go on for about a year. 
 The first thing I did after I finished reading this book was to pick up my phone and text my best friend, who I have known since I was eleven and has been there through every single one of my problems and ill-advised fringes, and tell her that I loved her. 
 The second thing I did after I finished reading this book was flip back to the beginning and start reading it again. 
 I don't mind admitting that it took me and this book a while to really get going.. The way this book was written with all the capital letters bothered me and the changing in perspectives and everything really confused me. 
 It took me a good 100 pages to get into but seeing as this book is over 400 pages long; that was absolutely fine. 
 And after those first 100 pages, I learnt the truth and that is: This book is fantastic. 
 I knew I'd love it when I was noseying at the wonderful Chachic's status updates and then I read the synopsis. 
 Spies? Pilots? Codes? Secrets? History? Best friends? 
 Mancunians?! 
 These are a few of my favourite things... 
 I loved the setting. I loved the plot. I loved the era. 
 And the twists absolutely threw me (although, I did have the smallest of small inklings of one thing but that's only because I have a clever dad who eats history books for breakfast and I accidentally asked a question that got made me put a few things together...) 
 The twist and the ending.... I just can't even think about them without jibbering. 
 Code Name Verity is The Usual Suspects of YA literature. 
 Like I said above, the second thing I did after I finished reading this book was to go back to the beginning and read over certain parts again. I know that this book will be one of those books that will get better and better every time I read it. 
 I loved Verity. I loved Maddie. 
 They were real girls. 
 They laugh, they cry, they flirt with boys, they gossip, they're loyal, they fly planes, they can land planes, they can speak different languages, they can crack codes, they can do the unthinkable, they do the right thing. 
 I loved that, with Maddie and Verity, Ms Wein showed that you can be strong, you can be brave, you can be good at what you do, you can be the best at what you do and you can do all this without sacrificing your femininity and/or becoming a passive-aggressive ""message"". There was never a sense that these ladies did what they did in a ""Look! Look! We can do it too. We're just as good as boys!"" and because they had something to prove. 
 They were such rich and beautiful characters and I loved, loved, loved them both so dearly. 
 And, anyway, boys didn't even get a look in. They wouldn't be able to keep up with any of the girls in this book. 
 Pffft. 
 ;-) 
 The phrase ""Careless talk costs lives"" is mentioned frequently in this book and I couldn't help but be reminded of this poster: 
 [Here!] 
 Also, the fact that that I own that very poster [bought from the Imperial War Museum North, I've still not been to the London one, or the Churchill War Rooms, yet... one day :) ] and it is hanging up on my bedroom wall....that helped too. 
 So that's it. 
 That's my review. 
 It doesn't do this book justice in the slightest but it's the best that I can do. 
 Arm yourself with tissues, read this book, prepare to be amazed and always fly high. 
 Read this review and lots of other exciting things on my blog here."
2,"2.5 Stars 
 Makani wondered why discussing a tragedy - consuming every story about it - was often comforting? Was it because tragedies manifested a sense of community? Here we are, all going through this terrible thing together. Or were tragedies addictive, and the small pleasures that came from them a signal of a deeper problem? 
 This was pitched as Scream meets YA and I was super excited, because Scream is my all time favorite horror movie and I've liked Stephanie Perkins' books in the past, but overall I was left feeling a bit underwhelmed. In There's Someone Inside Your House, we follow students at Osbourne High School as classmates are being picked off by a serial killer. To discover the killer and find the next target, the students must look into their past and confront their secrets before it's too late. 
 Things I Liked 
 The romance was actually really sweet and cute. I liked Mikani and Ollie, their relationship was one of my favorite parts of the story. They had great interactions and I liked all their scenes together. Plus, hanging out with Mikani's grandmother was fantastic! 
 There was actually some suspenseful moments, this might have been helped by the fact that I was reading this at 3am. I liked the intense moments and the darker grittier scenes when the killings were happening. A few were a little ridiculous, but mostly they kept me engaged. 
 I actually really loved the beginning of the story, and it hooked me right away. I love that the school's play was Sweeney Todd - it set a great atmosphere, along with the Halloween time. And I really liked the introduction to the killer. 
 Things I Didn't Like 
 Alex, one of Mikani's best friends, was super annoying to me the whole time. We just clashed and I didn't particularly care for her. 
 I took way too long to figure out what was up with Mikani's mysterious past. And once we finally figured out what happened it was a let down, and just really took me out of what was happening in the main plot. Plus her parents were atrocious people. 
 I went into this expecting horror, or at least YA horror, and I feel like I got Disney channel horror. It wasn't bad, I just wanted a little more. Like I said above, I did find some moments to be suspenseful, but there was this haze of romance that kept it from getting really threatening. 
 The killer reveal happens around the halfway marks and I was like, WHO? Then I was like, who cares? I wasn't really blown away by the killer reveal, and I thought the motive was a little weak. 
 This was really a mixed bag for me: I loved the diversity we get in the characters (Mikani is black and native Hawaiian; Darby is trans), and the romance between Ollie and Mikani was probably my favorite part. But, I don't really want the romance to be my favorite part in a horror story. This felt more like a contemporary with a serial killer side plot. It was still a pretty fun read that I flew through, even if a few of the characters did annoy me. There's Someone Inside Your House was a good book to turn you in the direction toward fall and get you ready for Halloween, before the real spooky stuff gets here. 
 I received a copy of the book from Dutton Books FYR via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review."
4,"Sixteen-year-old Tessa has decided to stop her treatments for leukemia so that she feels well enough to enjoy her last few months of life. She makes a list of things that she wants to do before she dies, including having sex, doing drugs, committing a crime, becoming famous, and falling in love. 
 The title tells you how the book ends, but the story is not predictable. Tessa's list is so unusual that you never know what she's going to do next. This book is beautifully written. I especially like the end where reality is mixed with thoughts and Tessa's instructions to her family members. I also like the unconditional love that Tessa's family and boyfriend have for her. She treats them horribly, and they never give up on her. 
 The author did a great job of showing the complicated emotions that surround death, but the realistic emotions also made it difficult for me to connect with Tessa. In the beginning of the book, she is so angry, and so ungrateful, and so selfish that I disliked her immediately. She does get a little better at the end of the book, but it's not enough for me to like her. I really hate her pessimistic friend, Zoey. The younger brother is inconsistent and often acts much younger than his age. 
 This book's greatness comes from the effect that it has on the reader. It makes you think about what you want to do with your life. It makes you grateful for your relationships. It makes you appreciate the everyday things. Most of all, it makes you happy to be alive."
4,"Fire by Heather James is an enjoyable fantasy that follows the stories of Roxy, a fiery Helian Protector, and Jasmine, the girl who doesn't quite belong. 
 I really liked this book. I loved Roxy's chapters, watching as she was brought in on the scheme that follows the Helian pattern of generally just being nasty to the other nations. It's not often that we get a point of view from the antagonists, and Roxy was such a convincing character that I was really unsure of how this was going to end up. 
 Jasmine and Brae have been friends for a long time; so when Brae announces his intention to travel to the Helian realm for the 'conference', Jasmine immediately worries. After a few disturbing dreams and some unusual developments of her own character, Jasmine sails herself to the Helian realm to save her friend. 
 The characters in this book were so defined that even if they didn't have their names above their chapters, you could still tell who was narrating, and I find that to be an exceptional thing. Too often characters sound like sock puppets and to read a book that finally bucked that trend was extremely refreshing. 
 During the second half of the book, I was surprised at how much I felt for a certain development on Roxy's behalf. I did not see it coming and I cannot explain how grateful I am that I was completely blindsided by this. I love when the author takes me completely unawares; it's part of the reason I read!! This is certainly one development that I can't wait to see in the sequel, Water. 
 Jasmine's ... unique... development was also very well executed. I figured it out about three quarters of the way through the book and had to put down my phone and go 'ohhhhhhh' because it made perfect sense and yet I didn't see it coming at all! 
 Recommend those who love surprising novels and the elements."
4,"There are flaws in this book, the biggest one is that it is slow, and it is longer than it should be because it is too slow. There are also enough logical issues, but I'm not going to list them here, since it is also a jewel, uncovering important pieces of history (Will is pointing beautifully to all the problems in this book in his great review). And it is also a beautiful true love story. Full of racism, and narrow minded people, between Caucasian and Asians, between Chinese and Japanese. Oh! the world is so full of this, and it was so much worse in the past. And with it, an almost impossible love story. 
 I bet that when most of us are thinking about WWII, we don't ask ourselves how it was to be a Japanese American in the USA. But if you think about it, it is kind of awful to be part of the ""enemy"" during a war, when you leave among the ""other side"". And it is sad that people tend to look at others, and in many cases judge them, by their race (""Japs go back home""). So sad but so true. And I found out, that there are pieces of history that I didn't know before, that WWII has so many awful human behaviors in it, that Americans actually ""relocated"" or ""evacuated"" Japanese to camps and held them prisoners. That Camp Harmony actually existed. 
 So not really a 4 star book, but definitely more than a 3 star book to me."

 This is a very dark romance novel that is extremely well written. 
 The basic plot is Celeb kidnaps Olivia to sell her as a pleasure slave. The story is told from the points of view both of the kidnapper and the victim. You really get the feel for the motivations of the two. In the case Celeb it boils down to 'the ends justifies the means' to explain his evil. He is clearly a monster but he feels his reasons justify his actions even though he realizes they are wrong."

 I know there are a lot of fans out there for this series, but I'm just not getting it. I don't regret reading it, but halfway through, I wasn't just going to put the book down just because I found it bland, right? 
 The characters came off as flat and uninteresting to me. The boys all seemed to share the same personality, with one trait to differentiate between them. Even Blue's family, whose interactions held a little more of my interest than the boys', felt dull and shallow. 
 Tension was also rather lacking, too. The book was predictable, and I found plot points conveniently placed. Whelk is randomly given a couple of chapters in the beginning of the story, then isn't brought up again until the last few chapters of the story. 
 It also annoyed me that there was so much hype built up around Blue having her first kiss or not, and then discovering that that moment never even presented itself in this book. 
 Nonetheless, I felt it necessary to get through the book. It was an easy read, somewhat of a fun story regardless of the strained and forced relationships. I couldn't relate with any of the characters, so perhaps that's why I felt this story to be uninteresting. 
 If you're looking for a quick trip into an alternate reality, then why not give this a try. But if you want substance, give this one a pass."
4,"This review is also available on my blog, Bows & Bullets Reviews 
 Okay, fair warning, if you haven't read Never Never Part 1, this will give away spoilers for that novella. Okay, now that's out of the way, Let's get to it. Never Never Part 1 left us with one hell of a cliffhanger. Silas and Charlie have been separated and Silas has just discovered that they are both going to loose their memories again. Silas at least has a note in his possession that explains part of the situation, but Charlie is out on her own. Charlie is in the middle of a city with no money and no memory of who she is. Charlie won't even have a phone or wallet to help her out because Silas has both of those things. And that's the end. It just stops as soon as the memory of the past two days fade away. I was unhappy to say the least. I don't like cliffhangers. Actually, I hate cliffhangers. I won't say exactly how Part 2 ends, but I will say that there isn't as bad as Part I. 
 Charlie and Silas are the same characters they were in book 1. I still love Silas and I'm still on the fence about Charlie. Silas is so sweet and determined to help Charlie. Even here, when he has absolutely no memories of the girl, he is hellbent on finding her and helping her. He's driven with a fiery need to save a girl he has never even met. If he hadn't already won my heart in the first part, he definitely would have here. Charlie, on the other hand, I didn't completely love. I mean, the situation she is in here makes it difficult not to sympathize with her. Where is she? Who is she? Why is she here? All very valid questions, but she doesn't have a way to answer then just yet. But the more I learn about her past actions, the more I am hesitant to really like her. She's done bad things and yes, she's been manipulated into doing them, but that's not the best excuse. All said, she's just not a character I trust. 
 This is an very intense story. You don't know who to trust, you don't know who is the bad guy. What the hell is happening to Charlie and Silas? That is the biggest thing I've been trying to wrap my head around. This series hasn't shown signs of being on the supernatural side of things, so what can cause memory loss like that? What causes amnesia like that? What can cause an identical case like that multiple times in two different people? They aren't taking any drugs or exposed to the same people when this last relapse occurred, so what the hell is going on? 
 Basically this novel is a big mystery. It gives us a little more insight to pre-memory loss Silas and Charlie, but still leaves so many unanswered questions that I don't see how just one more installment will solve everything. One thing is absolutely certain, just like Charlie and Silas, I NEED MORE ANSWERS! 
 Audio notes: 
 I liked the narrators a little better this time around. Maybe I was used to them. They were better this time around, but they still weren't amazing. I'll definitely give more of their work a shot, but I won't go out of my way to seek it out.

3,"I've noticed that this book gets a lot of praise and a lot of hate. I understand both sides. When I started, I couldn't understand why people enjoyed this book. Once I finished, I understood the misguided acclaim. This was almost a great book. Almost. 
 I understood Mae's exhilaration at getting this job because it sounds perfect(view spoiler)[before the whole ""going transparent"" thing; that's a deal-breaker (hide spoiler)]. I want to live on this campus. I want free clothes and free food. I want next-level healthcare. All it costs is that I have to document everything on Facebook? Sign me up. I'll ride this pony for the next five years, save all my income by staying in the dorms and taking advantage of freebies and finish with a tidy nest egg. Awesome. 
 So with that mindset, I felt that Mae barely did any research on the Circle. She didn't understand the basic tenets of the job. She thought social media wasn't a priority when in fact it's practically the highest priority. She didn't realize that the workers in the circle were basically guinea pigs to learn about new trends. Anyone should have known this going in so why didn't she? With so many workers in the company being followed by millions of people, why wasn't she following anyone before she started so she could get an idea of what to expect? You dropped the ball, Mae! 
 Not to say that the Circle didn't screw up as well. Denise and Josiah at HR and Gina (from IT?) also failed at introducing Mae to the campus and social media properly. HR takes her around the campus and even state that they'll probably go over the same stuff that Annie showed her but somehow failed to mention the importance of social media and participation on the campus? When they have the meeting with her later and chide her for not knowing, did they not realize that it was their own fault for not going over it before? Gina waits well over a week to install Mae's participation screen and no one notices. What's that about? 
 TL;DR most of the beginning conflict could have been avoided with a newbie handbook. 
 Mae herself is a terrible protagonist. She's unlikeable and frustrating to follow. I constantly thought she was tstl but somewhere after the chiding session with HR in which Denise asked her if she had low self-worth, I realized that her personality is written a few years too young. She isn't a realistic 24 year-old but she is a completely realistic college/high school student (This goes for others, like Alistair, as well). She's impulsive, reckless, and easily slighted. It made the dialogue more palatable and the interactions between other workers more believable. She absolutely has low self-worth. This is evidenced by her continual return to Francis and insta-trust in Kalden. (view spoiler)[ Speaking of which, no one who prematurely ejaculates should ever ask for a sex rating. What a douche canoe. (hide spoiler)] The sexy scenes in this book are anything but. The word crown has been ruined forever, thanks. At the end, you realize that Mae had to have this personality for the story to work. It would have turned out much differently if Mae had integrity and self-worth. 
 So why would this get such high acclaim? (view spoiler)[ Because it shows how a dystopian future like Brave New World can turn into 1984. That is such an intriguing premise! I love both of these books and to be able to bridge them together is just So. Much. Awesome. It's too bad that it wasn't executed well. (hide spoiler)] 
 I had problems with the fact that absolutely no one would question the issue of privacy (view spoiler)[ especially after seeing in the demonstration an old lady walking around her house in a towel. (hide spoiler)] 
 The views on sex are puzzling. In some cases, (view spoiler)[like Francis and the reaction from the populace to Mae's parents (hide spoiler)], it's a total non-issue but then in others it is. (view spoiler)[Annie is sickened by and worried how others will view her parents having a consensual open relationship. (hide spoiler)] 
 Lastly, the idea that people are civil because of the transparency is inconsistent. (view spoiler)[ such as the treatment of Mercer online and a person saying ""up yours"" to Mae's MS-stricken dad. (hide spoiler)] 
 This story had so much potential. I feel like it could have been so much better if it had focused on Annie instead of Mae. Annie's character was funny, eccentric, and smarter. I was bummed when she left for a big portion of the story. (view spoiler)[ Why didn't Kalden go to her?! (hide spoiler)]. I would love to read that angle. I loved the premise. If the plot had been tweaked, this could easily have been on par with the greatest dystopian novels. I think that people liked the premise so much that they were willing to overlook the major issues in the book. I can't though. This diamond is bogged down by too much rough."
4,"A lot more action and violence, and Sookie gets more involved with the vampires. I kinda dig it. Also, I think I really enjoy Sophie-Anne."
4,I NEED DEITY OUT LIKE YESTERDAY OK THANKS.
1,"I am a big fan of Bella Forrest's Shade of Vampire series. When I realized she started a new series, I was absolutely excited. I stopped a little under halfway through the book due to lack of interest. I feel like the story has potential, but the feelings are automatic (no buildup, no chemistry, etc) and the relationship just moves too fast and isn't that believable. 
 Amy has always been sheltered by her father. She is home-schooled, doing her schoolwork online due to being born with HIV. Her father is a chef at a prestigoius acting school, and it's Amy's dream to become an actress. She often sneaks in to watch letctures and practices. One day when filling in her father at work, she ends up auditioning for a scholarship--and get it. The headmaster, Liam, was a famous actor and she's stunned he threw away his Hollywood career to run the school. She falls for him not knowing what he is."
5,"In my lifetime I've probably read thousands of books. I can honestly say I've never read anything like The Book Thief. I am not going to give a lot of details about the book because it just needs to be read, but I will say this - I cried at the end. And for those of you that know me, this is a rare occurence. I don't know if I was crying at the story, at the weight of what the characters carry or simply that this extraordinary book was over. I'll let you figure it out. 
 ""I have hated the words and I have loved them, and I hope I make them right."""
1,"It's a great premise, but 2 hours into the audiobook, I was just...bored. I had to shelve it; too many books awaiting!"
3,"Eve is a post apocalyptic or dystopian themed YA novel that takes place in a not too distant future America devastated by a plague that has killed a large part of the population. In their desperate attempt to rebuild, the powers that be make some drastic changes and enact some rather heartless policies. 
 Eve was full of action and suspense and I was sucked into the story very quickly, from the first chapter. There were many exciting plot twists that I wasn't expecting and Anne Carey was none too gentle with her characters. There were a few times that I thought that events happened a little too coincidentally but it was easy to overlook those small instances when the story itself was so entertaining. I finished this in just one day, this was definitely a book I couldn't put down once I started it. 
 The world that Eve inhabits is a fascinating place, however, it certainly pushed the boundary of believability in some areas. There were a lot of details mentioned but left unexplained regarding the hows and whys of this world. It raised quite a few questions for me as I was reading and I thought several times that there will be some readers who will dislike being expected to just take all of these things at face value. I honestly would have liked more explanation as to why it was so important, for instance, that the two sexes be kept strictly apart, what was being done with the children from the breeding programs, and how was nobody in this society having an issue with orphan children being forced to work in labor camps, among many other unanswered questions. I hope that some of these issues are addressed in future novels. 
 The characters were one of the strongest aspects of Eve. Eve herself wasn't always a very likable character. But this made sense considering the absurd ideas that she was basically brainwashed to believe since she was five years old. I thought that in many ways, Eve reminded me of a typical teenager, often making stupidly impulsive decisions that she later regretted. However, in this society, these impulsive decisions sometimes had deadly consequences. The author was none too gentle with her characters and none of them made it through the book unscathed. 
 The relationships between the characters were emotionally charged and believable. I loved the dynamic between Eve and many of the secondary characters, especially the boys Silas and Benny. It was almost a ""Wendy meets the Lost Boys"" kind of situation, with the boys so desperately needing a mother figure. I hope I see more of them in future installments. The romance between Eve and Caleb as well as the friendship between Eve and Arden was flawed, interesting, and seemed very authentic. Each of the characters were allowed to grow and change a little as the story progressed. None so much as Eve, who slowly grew from a naive schoolgirl to a tough and much wiser young woman. This made sense considering some of the harsh lessons she was forced to learn from her mistakes. 
 Overall, I thought that Eve was a thrilling dystopian that, even with its flaws, was an exciting read. Again, the characterization was where Eve excelled. The writing, pacing, and plot were also very well done. However, I'm only rating it a 3 because of the holes in the world building and because of the awful ending. I will definitely be picking up the second book in this series because, even though there were some flaws and it ended badly, I really enjoyed reading Eve and would recommend it to any fans of YA dystopian or post apocalyptic books."
4,"Daemon... love to hate him and hate to love him (book ended on a perfect note. I felt as Kat did.) 
 This book... love to love it. Aliens is new for the YA I've read so far and all too welcome if alien books read this well. 
 Looking very forward to picking up the next. Like in 3... 2... 1..."
3,"I really went into this book, thinking I was going to like it. I did like the romance part of this book even though it was a bit cheesy, it was quite adorable. Also I really liked all the characters in this book, well with the exception of Dad. I problems with this book or all the side stories, they were just a little I don't even know over-the-top, unnecessary, and just generally annoying. Another very annoying thing I found was this author is not American and it was very apparent and some of the terminology she used,, Maybe she needed and American editor or something, or unless she had her heart set on these boys playing hockey, I'm a little bummed I wanted to like this, but for a short book it took me an attorney to read. Definitely not my favorite, not quite sure if I will ever read another book by this author.perhaps she could've move this entire story to England, I don't know if the setting really mattered."
5,"I was thinking of 4 stars, but the conclusion of the book was so perfect and heartwarming that I had to bump it up to 5 stars. Bravo on that, R.K Lilley! Perfect ending. 
 ""Love doesn't let you walk away clean. Love is messy. Love takes a fucking piece of you before it's done."" 
 This is the conclusion of Danika and Tristan's whirlwind of a destructive romance. 
 In the first book we saw their beautiful beginnings. The young Danika and the flirty fun Tristan growing to have a love so deep and powerful that few ever get to feel that same passion. Slowly began their spiral into their Rock Bottom in book 2. Heartbreaking and so, so destructive. 
 ""I'm Tristan. I am an alcoholic and a drug addict. I'm here because using cost me the love of my life."" 
 Book 3 was their second chance at life, friendship, and love. 
 ""How can you still love her so much?..."" 
 ""Because that's how love works. It doesn't die, even when you don't feed it. That's just the way it is... Loving her has become a part of who I am."" 
 The book opens with a catch up on the time they spent apart leading up to their imminent face to face (literally, in the woods hehe) at James and Bianca's wedding. 
 In the beginning, I didn't think there was enough growth individually for them to try anything new. It was toned down but there was still intense jealousy, anger and hurt. But without the aid of alcohol and drugs, it was handled better. 
 There were a few things I didn't like, like them meeting the first time and jumping each others bones in the woods at their best friends wedding. But, that is them. They never had issues in the sex department. I just wish they would have started over a little more slowly and had more of the fun banter that was in the first book. 
 But all in all a wonderful book and an amazing ending to Tristan's and Danikas story. Two people never deserved happiness more."
5,"I was actually going to rate 4 because I think Brooke is such a b*tch. I'm not actually thrilled by this novella. And I prefer to have another ROAR novella (ROAR AND ARIA specifically). 
 But I considered it for Veronica Rossi's sake. 
 For making me fall for her novel and its characters. She's so good at making characters. I can't explain how, as if all of them is special and she makes me want to request a novella for each of them. 
 She somehow lift up Brooke's character because of this novella. I also like that she included the three Seer brothers here. 
 And for being so nice at her book signing (I think she's the nicest-friendliest author I've met. So far.) 
 (Now the story) Brooke is strong but I think she's lost. 
 ""We are all hurting and missing people. Everyone is scared, so you can't talk about your worries because worries are everywhere. When everyone you know is on verge of drowning, you don't stop to tell the person next to you that you don't like swimming. 
 You just don't."" 
 This is my imagination & reaction to the story... this contains spoilers 
 Hateful Brooke who hates Dwellers but liked Soren among all of those who made it to the Tides. 
 Me: They will fit each other. somehow same attitude. 
 She's hurt because of Perry & Aria so she decided to move on. 
 Me: That's nice your in the right track. 
 At exactly that night she made that plan through Hyde. 
 Me: That fast? Ok fine. 
 Next night, she was with Hayden. 
 Me: There you are again b*tch. What are you doing? They're brothers! 
 Next morning, she wasn't lost anymore. 
 Me: Congratulations! 
 ""Hyde and Hayden are incredible in their own ways, but I'm not ready to open my heart again. Not yet, but one day I know I will be. One day I'll find someone who will see me as the best instead of one of the best. I will find a life-sustaining love."" 
 I liked the ending most. When she chose to call Haven ""HAVEN"" instead of Straggler (who would trade a beautiful name for Strag?). Then she kissed him (which for me is cute) and that made me want to have a set of novellas from those 3 brothers. Just to know their reactions. 
 I don't know for others but for me, after considering things, maybe Brooke & Soren will be a good match. 
 Now I'm looking forward for that. Let's see in the next book..."
4,It felt like the action slowed down a bit and its beginning to feel like an overload of characters but it was still enjoyable.
4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 First of all, I'm going to start panicking over tornado warnings and being hyper aware of sirens and threatening skies again -- I usually get nervous, but it's true that I also don't usually go the basement again on the assumption it's just another thunderstorm. 
 And this book was a lesson in why complacency is bad. The action starts right away, which I like, with the first third being devoted to the massive tornado and its immediate aftermath, and rest covering how Jersey gets tossed around from place to place for the remainder of summer (there's a metaphor in there, somewhere). There's a lot of really excellent detail about just how devastating the aftermath looks, as well as how they tell you how to prepare for tornadoes, but not what comes after, when everything's mildewing and your power's out and the ambulances can't come through the blocked streets. 
 My heart ached for all the different kinds of loss she suffered (what the hell, Ronnie!), and there is honestly a whole 'nother book in there about what her life might have been like with her awful biological father's family and/or as a runaway (FANFICTION??), but I loved the happy-as-possible ending. Despite the steady revelations that her deceased mother might have actually been a huge jerk. 
 The detail I liked best was her collection of ceramic kittens and the single one that survives the tornado, especially after learning where they came from. I'm not going to forget that for a long time."
4,"More of a 3.5 but I'll rounding up on this one. 
 I was pleasantly surprised, this was an good read, and I'm very much wanting to read the next one. I liked the take on angels and Raffe made me happy. I wish it'd been a little bit longer, as the end felt a little bit loose, but I'm okay with it."
5,"""This is my secret - that any moment I might fly away."" 
 Wow and I mean wow. This is a tough book. NOT for the faint of heart. 
 but this is a wonderful book. About a beautiful boy and the girl who became his friend - because of a moment they shared. and that one moment and many moments after, all their moments, were pieces of a greater puzzle that left them both completely changed. 
 But this is a real story. It's ugly and hard and real life. It just is. 
 Read it, it's amazing."
4,"The book was great, but I actually liked the show's version (season 1) a whole lot better; A first for me..."
5,"Reread - Januari 9th 2016: 
 Still just as gorgeous. 
 First read - August 9th, 2014: 
 Very beautiful. It really pulled me in. I think it was really well done how it went back and forward between what was happening and all the flashbacks showing us what Mia's life was like. I didn't actually know the plot of this book before I started reading, so I didn't expect it to be this emotional. The fact that there's a sequel meant that I knew what she would choose all along, but that didn't stop me from getting absorbed in this story and in the terrible situation Mia is in. Honestly, I don't think I would've been strong enough to make the decision she made if it'd been me and my family."
3,I like the first boook but one would be terribly disappointed if she'd expect more on the romance part of the story. Risa is simply too frustrating to be a sex-crazed Mary Sue. But the reason for the rating was that the overall story that was too slow to carry on and only several events that revolved around it which made the book quite a pain to finish since all story progression was building up to the next book. Since the next book will be out in a month so I will not give up on this since I like Azriel and luckily Lucian is getting slimier by the moment so I don't really think its necessary to be all fandoming the Aedh.
4,"After reading Reckless the other day I was excited to read more by this author. Rebel didn't disappoint, though it felt like a very different book. Where Reckless made me so full of love and warm fuzzies, Rebel was just plain hot. 
 Rubi has a lot of issues letting people in. She doesn't really trust people or know how to have a real relationship. She has never seen that growing up so she doesn't have anything to base it on. Her dad has been absent and always just left without even telling Rubi. He was never there for her and she never had anyone really. Now as an adult she only sleeps with guys once and that is it. She doesn't want to know them or talk to them or anything. One night and done. That or she is friends with them. Either one, because she doesn't want to hurt anyone. She knows she has issues and so she never wants to go from friends to more as by the time they are friends she cares about them. 
 Wes is a country boy, but works with Jax at his stuntman company. He loves it and has always dated these sweet innocent girls. Then he meets Rubi and he is intrigued. He spends time with her, really getting to know her, and starts falling for her. She is exactly what he never knew he wanted and needed. He tries to go slow with Rubi, but she can be frustrating. He asks her out and she refuses even though he knows she wants to say yes. She wants him as much as he wants her so he has a hard time not acting on it. Until he does. 
 Wes is really great with Rubi. He knows she has her issues, knows she is scared of feeling the way she does and wanting the things she wants. He gets frustrated at times, but he keeps himself together. He wants everything with Rubi, but he knows if he pushes she will just shut him out for good. As it is it takes him a while to start to really move forward with her. He was incredible. So kind and caring and patient. I loved him. 
 Of course everything works out in the end, but getting there is a challenge. Rubi definitely doesn't make it easy on Wes, but man are they hot together. Luckily they both have Lexi as well who helps them both. Lexi pushes Rubi to give Wes a chance, to not ruin something that great because she is afraid. She helps Wes understand Rubi and why Rubi is the way she is. I loved seeing Jax and Lexi again and I can't wait for more from this author!

5,"Preppy is alive, obviously or there would be no book! My favorite character of the series is back and with his own books. Which is a big order as I have loved the whole King series and the characters. 
 When last we read the series, we had thought Preppy dead and then gloriously found out we were wrong and he was alive. I had hatred in my thoughts for TM Frazier when she 'killed' off Preppy. But not it is nothing but sunshine and roses!!!! Love you TM!!!!! Anyway, I digress, this book is about Preppy in captivity and also years early when he interacted with Dre, the granddaughter of Mirna, one of the grow grannies. 
 Dre had one unfortunate accident turn her life to hell. From the pain of the accident, she looked for an escape and found it in heroin. They meet when she and two male 'friends' decide to rob her granny of her weed but unknowingly put them in the path of one Samuel 'Preppy' Clearwater. He ends up chasing her, after firing some rounds at her. Then has to save her when, while on a water tower, she decides to end her life. What follows is a slow building, strange, no, a very strange relationship between the two. 
 Till Preppy does something to damage it. 
 Told in both the present, his being captive, and the past, their meeting, and relationship. This book was outstanding. I loved it. 
 5 stars!!!!!!"
4,"OMG!!! I Finally read it. This was one of my most anticipated books to read and I patiently waited for it to come. By the way I was very, very pissed off when the changed the release date. I was all excited ready to buy it and then BAM!!! They go and change the date. Why would they do that so last minute? Why? The point is that I was very excited and it did not disappoint, sort of. 
 This book starts where The Assassin's Curse left off. Our wonderful Naji and Ananna are still on the Isles of the Sky with no way of getting out. Only now they find a new creature on the island, a MAN-eating manticore with a taste for Jadorr'a which Naji happens to be, but don't worry she doesn't eat cursed meat so he's safe...for the time being. Then they set sail when Marjani finds them and helps them complete the three impossible tasks, or the two remaining ones any way. 
 Now here comes the problems with this story. The three tasks were first, hold a princesses starstones skin to stone. Second, create live out of an act of violence. Third, have true loves kiss. Now we all know that the one we really wanted to see was the third task when they would finally kiss and it would be very dramatic and romantic but no. They kiss by like chapter three or more like Ananna kisses him in his sleep and he doesn't return it when he wakes up and she whines about it the whole darn time. 
 In this book Ananna is ALL about Naji. She is all over him and all why doesn't he love me, blah, blah, blah? It was a bit too much but oh well. Naji is still pretty cool. I felt even worse for him I this book because of his scars and he is even more self-conscious than before. But there were some seriously steamy moments between the two of them. There was a lot of back and forth with the romance. It was I love you, wait I didn't mean it but wait I really do I just can't admit it and all that random crap. 
 Then there was that task where he had to create life out of violence and honestly I think the author didn't know how she was going to pull that off so she made up some weird ending with some awkward solution that was just strange. Seriously, that was such an awkward solution; I was like, what kind of bull is this? But it worked out sooooo, yeah. 
 I had a lot of problems with the story but I LOVED IT!!!! I never wanted it to end though I wanted more Naji. We never really got to look into Naji's mind. I wanted to know what went up in a love sick assassins mind. Oh well 
 By the way this is a really crappy review."
4,"There are so many thoughts that I want to 'vomit' it out but I can't. I need to properly process it, screen it back in my head and freeze it. 
 This book is good and as usual, weird. In a good way, for me."

 This review was posted at Under The Covers 
 OK, call me crazy, but you might notice that I didn't necessarily love book one of this series. I had to actually push myself to finish it. But here I am reading book two. Why you might ask? A couple of reasons actually. 
 1. I have a bad habit of wanting to know what happens in a series. It has to really be terrible for me to not give it another shot. 
 2. Kristina Douglas is actually a pen name of Anne Stuart. And I LOVE Anne Stuart. So I wondered how can I love her work as Anne Stuart and not give this other pen name another shot? 
 3. I actually liked the world itself in this series and I was intrigued by Azazel's character in the first book. 
 So what did I learn? The series does get a little better. For the most part I didn't want to kill the heroine and believe that's a step up from what I wanted to do the first heroine. However Azazel disappointed me. I was expecting him to wow me and he just fell a bit flat. 
 In a nutshell, it's been 7 years since the death of his mate and he's still not fully recovered. He's assigned with finding a human woman believed to be the Demon Lillith, and the prophecies say she's supposed to end up being his wife. His job is not only find her but basically deliver her to her death. Except she has no memories or even instincts of who or what she is and he finds himself caring for her as a woman. And if part of his job of bringing her down is to sleep with her, to prove that she doesn't have power over him, then well, we won't say how he succeded or not at that task. 
 Now Rachel is by no means the brightest bulb in the box but she's ok. And Azazel had some hot moments. So it's not all bad and there is hope still. However, it may take a little bit of time before I'm ready for book three in this series."

5,"Okay. Here's the deal. There is something about reading a book in one sitting that is unlike reading a book whenever you have time. I'm not kidding. When you read a book in one sitting, I don't know, it seems real. You forget YOUR life, and become absorbed in the book. It's like watching a movie. We tend to watch them in one go, and during that time we forget about everything else. 
 But most people don't do this for books. So while you can still really enjoy it, the experience will never be quite the same as if you had read it all at once. If you've never done this before (but let's be honest, you probably have since this is a blog about BOOKS), I really encourage you to do so. 
 Needless to say, I read The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer in one sitting. Perhaps that is why I am so obsessed with this book. I LOVED it. Really. 
 Let's begin with the cover. Seriously. Awesome. Period. Here's why: First of all, I really love underwater covers. They just seem so...ethereal. But another thing I like about this cover is the way they've staged the people in it. When you think of two people hugging, you get warm, fuzzy feelings, right? Well, not in this cover. The way the guy is reaching around from behind, his arms clasped tightly around her while her pulls her farther down into the water is, well, creepy. And it totally sets the tone for this book. 
 Then I read the description, and bought the book. So the cover succeeded. 
 Anyway, about the, you know, story. It's great. I'm not sure what it is, but there's something about the whole am-I-going-crazy-or-is-everyone-else-nuts storyline that intrigues me. I really liked the setting; warm locals are my favorite so Florida was a no brainer. 
 I liked Mara; she handled everyone thinking she was nuts pretty well. Considering. 
 But let's be real. No one cares about Mara. This is the Noah show. Holy God. This guy is ATTRACTIVE. I think I would like my own Noah. Just what is it about bad boys? I know in real life I wouldn't want to date one...And I swear some of those scenes between the two of I couldn't even handle, they were so hot. I don't think I've been so invested in the relationship of two characters for quite some time. 
 Funny story, but after I had finished the book I tweeted the author about how much I wanted my own Noah, and I kid you not a couple days later a Noah Shaw tweets me. I DIED. That was so cool. 
 This book isn't perfect, though. There are a couple things I didn't like. While I adore Noah, there were some things he did (or was rumored to have done) that I didn't like. It made him seem like more of a jerk than the whole tortured soul thing. Mostly I had a problem with it because I know I'd never be able to date a guy like that and I really, really want to be able to imagine myself with him. ;) 
 Also, Mara's brother was kind of annoying. Too perfect. He never did anything wrong, always told her what to do, blah, blah. I hope I get to see some character development with him later in the series. 
 I also thought there could be more paranormal elements to the story; it seemed more focused on the romance. 
 But seriously, though. Loved this book. Definitely read it. I am just dying (har-har) to get my hands on the next one. I totally have October 23rd marked on my calendar. 
 5/5"
4,"4.5 stars 
 ""Has anyone ever taken care of you?"" he asked quietly. 
 ""No."" I'd long since stopped feeling sorry for myself about it."" 
 Feyre, oh what a badass character she is. She has overcome so many obstacles in her 19 years of living. From riches to rags, at the age of 13 she taught herself how to survive, to keep her family alive. And it made me furious that they didn't appreciate everything she did for them. For 6 freaking years Feyre fed their sorry asses just because her mother who surprisingly, didn't appreciate her, made her vow that she would take care of her sisters and her limping father. I don't hate them though, I actually grew fond of the sisters. 
 The writing is beautiful. Sarah J. Maas captured beautifully every grassy green hill and the colours Feyre saw through her eyes. I've got to admit that I seriously had to google what words like 'brethren' meant but I love knowing more so good for me? (view spoiler)[All the sex scenes were quite intense but appropriately described. So were those scenes in which Feyre felt lil tingly in her private parts, e.g. ""-- heat began pounding in my core, between my legs."" Girl... I see you. (hide spoiler)] 
 The characters were complex. All of them had so much depth it was almost overwhelming. (Not really but I just wanted to say that to make this review more professional even though I've already said 'ass'.) I actually liked Rhysand and had a feeling he was one of the good guys when he lied to Amarantha. He's probably a selfish prick though and it's why I don't trust him completely. Nesta and Elaine's character development, YES. Lucien was wonderful and witty, everything I need from a character. Plus he's got that tragic past and sadness that lingers with him. Oh and Tamlin with his awful compliments and killer body. I love him. I love them all. 
 I feel kind of bad for not giving this book 5 stars."
4,"Why must Lara Jean always take something pretty bad, ruin it, and then take something great, throw it in the trash, and then decide to fix the bad thing instead of the perfectly whole great thing?? 
 Is she okay?? Does she even HAVE a brain? 
 (I know that whole first sentence made no sense but bear with me. I'm upset.) 
 In the spirit of the series, I thought I would write Lara Jean a letter. 
 (view spoiler)[ Dear LarafrickinJean Song Covey, 
 I hate everything you did in this book. The hate fills up inside me, all the way to the brim, and I feel like I could overflow. I hate your decisions so much I don't know what to do with it. 
 Peter is not right for you. You know who is? John. 
 You know why? Because he likes you a lot, and he respects you, and you're on the same wavelength. You just fit so perfectly. 
 I know he lives a half hour away from you now, but shut up. That's no excuse. He's your soul mate. I mean, if you're too blind to see that, I wouldn't mind having him. Since, you know, you turned him down even though he was a much better boyfriend to you than Peter ever was even though he wasn't even your boyfriend. Whatever. 
 Genevieve. 
 You need to either get over her, or get over Peter, because at this point you have to understand that they're a package deal. Which is weird. I don't think you get that this will just become something you guys can throw in each other's face for the rest of your relationship and, knowing you two, you definitely will. 
 You had a wish. You could have wished for John to go on a date with you, or something. Instead you wished to get back together with the emotionally confusing Lax Bro that basically no one but Kitty approves of. 
 I just don't . . . understand. You have no future with him, necklace or no necklace. He can't always protect you, video or no video. He definitely can't understand you, which he's pretty much shown. 
 In all fairness though, it's not only Peter. You're pretty annoying too. 
 I'd really appreciate it if you got your act together in Book #3 and either brought Josh back into the picture (where the heck did HE go?) or march your butt up to John's house and profess your love. Either or, I'm really not that picky. 
 Always and forever, 
 Claire 
 P. S. You still like John and you know it.

2,"I wasn't a huge fan...half way through I got terribly bored and I felt no connection to any of the characters. And again, again, again, another book about two people falling in love in a completely unnatural way. Can't people fall in love by just getting to know each other anymore? I don't know anyone who meets a guy or girl and then mere weeks later is completely in love with them. And if they did, I would think they were an idiot who confuses love with lust. It was too unrealistic and the whole revenant thing wasn't that interesting to me, especially when Katie hung out Vincent's dead body. Yea, I don't care how much you say you love the dude. That's just really creepy and weird."
2,"You can find the full review and all the fancy and/or randomness that accompanies it at It Starts at Midnight 
 Le sigh. I wanted to love it, I wanted to soooo badly. But alas. It wasn't bad, but it was a bit underwhelming I suppose. Lucie and Ethan just did not excite me as characters, nor did I feel any real chemistry between them. Ethan was akin to watching paint dry, but at least he wasn't always around. Lucie just didn't strike me as a noteworthy heroine. She didn't really do much of anything, nor did she really inspire anyone or anything. 
 But the hardest part for me was the lack of world building. Okay, we're in New York, but some kind of weird New York, where there is Light and Dark, but I'll be damned if I know why or how. There was also a pretty sizeable info-dump which may have explained some of it, but I started skimming because I was bored. And I am not a skimmer by nature. And why did these people not like each other? I still don't understand. The Dark residents were clearly treated as ""less than"" by the Light Dwellers but I am still not sold on why. Then there was a revolution, because of course there was. Some of it felt like it didn't make sense, and the rest seemed cliched. Lucie was ""special"" to the revolution (which, in itself was pretty underwhelming), and the ""not-quite-a-love-triangle"" was extra special. Actually now that I think about it, there were a lot more similarities and tropes than I initially realized- but they're spoilery, so I can't even talk about them. Let's just say this checks a lot of boxes on the ""generic dystopian/fantasy"" trope list. 
 I did like a few things about the book. Mostly Carwyn. More of him and his snark, please and thank you. I feel like his presence made Lucie's personality ""pop"" a bit, and I liked their interactions together. I also liked Lucie's concern for her family, and the lovely family that took Lucie and her dad in after Lucie's mom was killed. 
 Bottom Line: I was mostly confused and underwhelmed, but there were a few bright spots. Still, definitely not what I had hoped for.

5,"I highly recommend Perfect Chemistry. 
 ***** 
 ELECTRIC. DELICIOUS. TEMPTING. 
 It is not hard to fall in love. It's the admission, the acceptance that's difficult. 
 I was never in Realistic Teen Fiction subgenre of YA, but wow, Simone Elkeles changed that. I read mainly to escape reality, so why would read stories that delve into that? 
 I did not just fall in love with Alex and Brittany. i was WHIPPED! and yeah, i'm proud of that. 
 amidst the flirting and attraction lies the reality of Alex's and Brittany's lives. One wants to escape, while the other wants to stay (stay perfect, stay still), but both puts up a facade. and yet, they see through each other's masks and found comfort and strength in each other's arms. 
 i have to say that i love Alex's POV more. it's raw, humorous, and well, goosebumps-worthy. i now have the hots for Alex. *fanning myself* 
 when the story got good, i have a sinking feeling that this might have a sh*tty ending, reality-fiction and all. Boy, was i wrong! It was rather an unexpected one, one that was very very much to my taste. :P 
 i liked that the author didn't beat around the bush. halfway through, when Brittany's feelings are starting to come out, she cuts to the chase and lay her feelings on the table. NICE! i'm impatient with stuff like this, so sue me. 
 Perfect Chemistry is a fun, spine-tingling, swoon-worthy read. 
 Feeling neglected by a loved one, lately? Then read this. teen romance, if not first love, doesn't get any better than this."
5,"Let's start with three facts, my friends. 
 When I listened to the audiobook of Days of Blood & Starlight, I gave it a 3, because the narrator does not work for me at all. 
 At several intervals, I paused while reading to put the book down and yell, ""THE WRITING IS SO PRETTY."" 
 Upon finishing, I basically just said ""Holy fucking shit"" over and over. 
 Read the full review at A Reader of Fictions."
5,"Main characters of color, an elaborate heist, magic of all shapes and sizes, more double crossings than you can imagine, witty dialogue and exciting action sequences make this book an incredible tale to fall into. I'm a bit confused as to how this is a series since the end got wrapped up neatly, but I'm interested to see what happens."
2,"This book had the great misfortune that I started to read as little as 5 days after I came across Torka aldrig tarar utan handskar, the emotionally most wrenching and painful series I've ever known. Compared to this Swedish show, The Fault in Our Start has been half of a children's party. 
 Despite that, I liked it. I liked it so much that I read the entire thing in less than half a day, which hasn't been happening since I was a child, and it was sad, really sad. 
 I'm going to give it three stars because honestly, the beginning was so terribe that I only continued to read it in order to make fun of the bad writing style. Over the course of the book it got better, and after Hazel and Gus returned from the Netherlands it was actually brilliant. Sad, but brilliant. 
 Unlike the other books I rate with 3 stars I would totally recommend it, too."
1,goodness I HATED the heroine in this book! The hero was great. But she totally ruined it!
5,"This book is beyond amazing! I mean I laughed, I cried, I couldn't put it down. I straight up devoured this book and it completely cements Ms. Cullinan as one of my all time favorite authors. I always tend to enjoy the stories about characters with disabilities, but this resonated with me in so many ways and was just plain touching. I adored watching these boys struggle to find their feet and step into the life that they could have together. 
 Emmet Washington may just be one of the strongest characters I've ever read. His autism is severe, but he's learned ways for him to function. Ms. Cullinan does a brilliant job writing his voice. As someone who grew up with a family member on the autism spectrum (though really I think looking back he probably would have been diagnosed as Asperger's if he'd ever had any sort of diagnosis) I understand how difficult it can be for someone to relate to and function in the ""normal"" world. I love how committed Emmet is to not only finding more ways to help himself, but how much he wants to help Jeremey and realizes that things are not right for the other boy. Emmet's voice was so distinctive and clear. I was drawn in by him and loved how he related to Jeremey. 
 As for Jeremey, oh my heart just broke for him. He was so buried under all of the emotions around him. He struggled each and every day just to function. But with Emmet in his life you could see the will to try growing for him. I really loved watching him find his feet, deal with his setbacks, and truly face the overwhelming depression and anxiety he was dealing with inside. 
 These two boys are two people whose difficulties in life should have made it impossible for them to be together and yet they so perfectly compliment each other. The skills they've had to learn in order to get up everyday and function actually help them to work things out as a couple no matter how hard it is. 
 I can't recommend this book enough and I know I will come back to it time and time again. It's so poignantly written and I fell in love with these characters. I can't wait to read the next book in the series!"
4,"This book was reviewed for Musings of a bookworm 
 I don't know if the premise of this book is realistic but it is interesting. This couple have been together 10 years and are just now facing their first bump in the road. There relationship is being tested by the opinion of the new preacher and his wife who are hateful, this turn the town, who it seems are all members of the preachers congregation, against the couple. Now the old preacher had no problem with them and the couple even went to the church, so just because the new guy says they are sinners the town shun them and even become aggressive and try to sabotage things on the ranch. I personally would like to think people are not quite so sheep like to blindly follow something that is 100% different from what they were doing before the advent of the new preacher. This is basically the story of how the couple deal with this and that is a interesting journey to take and makes for a darn good story."
4,"Well, this was beautiful! I did have enough problems with it so as not to give it a perfect rating, but I don't think it was anywhere near a three-star score, so... yup! 
 I wasn't as moved with this book as I was with Jandy Nelson's other one (and this is a very unfair comparison to make anyway) -- even though it does have a deeper, darker feeling to it (one I admit I could relate more closely to) --, but I really liked it and could hardly put it down. 
 And by the way, thank the saints I bought a physical copy before trying to read it digitally, because my Kindle would never be able to do Lennie's scribbled poems justice like paper and ink did. 
 Furthermore, it was interesting to see how much Nelson's writing improved from one book to the other, and how equally emotional and consistent her style is even while telling two completely different stories with very different characters and told from totally different points of view. I really, really, really want to read more from her! And I'll probably re-read IGYTS sometime soon, so there's that. haha"
3,"I wanted a lot from this book, and I would give it a B- on an A-F scale but based on what the stars mean on the Goodreads scale, I'd give it 2.5 stars. In between ""It was okay"" and ""I liked it."" 
 Premise: LOVED the premise. Had me sold right away. Sounded like Lost meets Mean Girls. 
 The first couple chapters had me laughing out loud and the whole tone of the writing made me smile - this very savvy, satirical, almost tongue-in-cheekiness that says ""I know this is ridiculous, that's the point, and can you tell that I'm actually making fun of our world?"" In many ways and in many scenes it reminded of something like Austin Powers - this kind of meta, self-aware parody that loves the source material but also loves making fun of it, saying everything with this big exaggeration and a wink. At times it also reminded me of the Josie and the Pussycats movie (do you guys remember that?? Alan Cumming was the bad guy!) 
 So all of that, I loved. The commercial breaks and little inserts and footnotes from The Corporation were very clever -- for a while. 
 About midway through, the book started to feel tedious. I think we were just on the island too long? So many meandering things happened that didn't need to or could have happened faster. I skimmed a lot of the middle TBH. 
 There were also SO MANY CHARACTERS that I never connected emotionally with any of them. The 3rd person narration had to be with all of them all of the time so it never gave me time to really identify with any of them. While I found them all interesting, I certainly didnt care if any of them died. 
 A while back, I saw some author answer a question in an interview (and I have NO IDEA who said it) and the question was ""What book would you like to see get made into a musical?"" and the author responded with this book. That's actually what made me look it up and want to read it. And I have to say I totally agree with the assessment. It would be a HILARIOUS musical, and the musical format would force them to cut down to only the necessary elements and shorten the whole thing a bit which would make it stronger. 
 I wanted to love this book but I didn't. It was okay. I really liked parts of it, and thought the concept was great. It was just too long and meandering and had too many characters. I would totally love to see the musical though."
4,"This was undoubtedly the most exciting book in this series thus far. The various weddings, deaths, murders, surprises, and twists made this a veritable unputdownable read, despite its hulking length. 
 I can't say exactly why, but despite all the excitement of A Storm of Swords, A Clash of Kings is still my favorite ASoIaF book so far."
3,"Cute cute cute. 
 Although it could have been trimmed a lot. Still. It was nice to get lost in some chick lit."
5,"First Line: ""Today I'm five."" 
 This is one of those hauntingly beautiful stories that will stay with you long after you finish the last page. Although the subject matter is difficult, Jack is such a well-developed and sympathetic (not to mention adorable) character that going through his trials and tribulations with him is both painful and cathartic. His innocent worldview makes hearing about the abuses of his captor both more and less painful which is an interesting dichotomy. He had the ability to make my chuckle and tear up simultaneously. His absolute love of his mother was extremely touching. I was also endlessly impressed by his mother's attempts to improve his physical and mental health and to keep him entertained and educated during their captivity. I don't want to give too much away, but if you are looking for an amazing read, please give Room a try.

4,"Funny, cute, and complicated."
4,"Another fine volume of the Swamp Thing, though it didn't feel particularly deep due to excessive decompression. I continue to be confused by the whole Alex-is-alive thing. I don't mind it, I just find it hard to figure out after 25 years of the converse. The highlight of the volume was the two issues set in the past (#0 and the Annual) both of which offered great backstory, great horror, and great Arcane."
5,"Oh my gosh, this was so good. I need to get my hands on the sequel."

4,"First read: fall 2011. 
 Read again: fall 2014. Liked it better this time around."
3,"I really like the idea behind the two main characters both having different issues to sort out and finding solace. That being said, it sometimes seemed like they were using each other and that it would all crash and burn. 
 The dual points of view, while serving to show more of the story, made it difficult to keep track of who was actually speaking unless they made a comment about their problem. 
 Additionally, I felt that the characters werent fleshed out enough. 
 Overall take: cute little story but don't expect in depth character development. It's written for youth and would be great in that age group. 
 *book received through netgalley in exchange for honest review*"
4,"Really interesting...unlike traditional paranormal books, here the werewolves, vampires and zombies are created by an evil government agency known only as the Project. Regular soldiers are taken against their will and infected with experimental viruses. The transformation is gruesome and permanent. The werewolves now also have the ability to turn or infect others by biting or scratching. 
 Lillian is a psychiatric hospital manager and she meets Jack when they bring him in to treat his injuries. There is an insta-lust mate love thing that happens immediately and it's pretty hot. 
 In a parallel story, we get to know Antonia the Blood or vampire. She's sent to hunt down the escaped pack...and runs into a hot werewolf of her own. I'm hoping this will be the next book."
5,"When i went to read this book i thought it would be like the first two in the series, good but not great. Then once i started reading i knew before i even reached chapter 5 that it would better than many books i've ever read. This book offers new conflict and characters are exposed in a new way. Not to mention the action and detail that had me practically seeing everything in my head. A page turner and exquisite read ""Better off Undead"" brings the The Bloodhound Files to a whole new playing field."
3,"Read this to Madam and favorite Cousin last night and they LOVED it. I love the strength of the language of how the owl describes his escapades, but found the book overall a bit tedious by the end."
4,"SERIES REVIEW 
 Allyson and Willem's story started in the first book, Just One Day. A series of fortunate circumstances - serendipity, you might say - brought them together to spend an amazing day in Paris, and within twenty four hours, find love in one another. 
 To be honest, I was really hesitant to pick this up at first. I didn't really like the sound of Shakespeare in the synopsis. I only picked it up because of the endless gushing of bloggers and readers alike. I still can't say whether it was worth it or not. 
 On the first book, we got to see Allyson's side of the story. We got to see how she and Willem met, talked, and eventually went on a trip to Paris together. Before meeting Willem, Allyson was the shy goody-two-shoes, but then after just one day, everything changed and she became this whiny teenager that I really hated! It was like she wanted to inflict more pain to herself by thinking about crazy things. Because of this, I wasn't able to enjoy the first book so much. But then about the middle or so of the book, Allyson goes to college and meets Dee, which is the redeeming point. Of course, at first she was still a bitch, but then with the help of Dee, she finally puts herself together and stopped being the whiny teenager that I've come to hate so much. So thank you, Dee, for being that thing that salvaged the book for me, and for being one of the reasons why I continued on to the next book. I seriously couldn't connect with Allyson for the most part. By the time she stopped being a whiny teenager, I was already 65% through, and too late to convince me to like the book. 
 As I said, Dee was only one of the reasons. The second is that, I thought: Well, I got this far already! I couldn't just go on with another book without knowing Willem's side of the story! I felt a need to understand what really happened, so I dared to read the second book, and hoped that it would at least be a bit better than the first book. 
 Reading Willem's point of view is definitely a great change because I didn't have to deal with a whiny teenage girl anymore. It was refreshing, and it actually made me thankful for continuing on to the second book, despite not getting what the fuss was about the first book. Willem's POV definitely made things better, and I began to like the story. In Just One Year, we get to see what really happened that night in Paris. Why had he left Lulu, and had he tried to look for her? All things were answered in the second book and more. Willem's book is definitely the better of the two, and I even picked up a few wise words from him here and there. I really like the second book, which make me almost thankful for picking up the first one. Almost. 
 Overall, I don't get what all the fuss was about the first book, but I finally understood after reading the story in Willem's point of view. I guess it was just the whiny part that I didn't like about the first book, but you've got to admit, it's pretty much a big part of the book. I give the first book 3 stars, and the second book 4.5 stars."
5,"At a point in your life you began to realize the obligation you have towards classics, you just owe it to yourself to read Dostoyevsky, i picked this one for i have set a goal to read whatever classics i can put my hands on, and i couldn't feel better i'm even proud of myself there's a hint of pleasure and accomplishment running through my veins while writing this because honestly Fyodor is MIND BLOWING. 
 Spoiler Alert! this is a short review only contained leading characters ""in my opinion"" (view spoiler)[ 
 Story takes place in ST.Petersburg Russia, Raskolnikov a former student is the leading character in the story, he's smug, arrogant delusional and a divided character, troubled young man who his pride and intelligence leads him into thinking he's superior to the rest of mankind, he believes the world falls into two categories ""Superior"" special people who can do whatever they want with no law of moral boundaries and second class who had everyone else. He believes he can break the rules in this case commit murderer for higher purposes, such as doing good and helping humanity with what he steals, so Raskolnikov murders the pawn keeper Alyona Ivanovna and Lizaveta her step sister, however guilt torments him and he believes he's not a Napoleon material, the idea of confessing torments him through the whole book, while reading i came to the conclusion he is crazy! even tho he thinks about confessing but not for the sake of being guilty for murdering the pawn keeper, he remains convinced that his crime was justified. 
 Raskolnikov's relationships with the other characters in the novel do help in understanding of his conflicted personality. Although he cares about Razumikhin, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, and Dunya, Raskolnikov is so caught up in his own head to the point he never notices their attempts to help him. He finds Sonya, his connection to Sonya was due to him thinking she's a sinner like him but what he fails to understand that Sonya's sin is selfless she sacrifices herself to help her parents and her three siblings but he essentially commits his crime for his sake alone to prove his theory. 
 Sonya is a quite poor devoted girl who sacrifices herself prostituting for the sake of her family. 
 Sonya, in her infinite capacity for understanding, begins to care deeply for him. She is not horrified by his crimes, but rather, concerned for his soul and mental well-being, urges him to confess. 
 Dunya is Raskolnikov's sister also one of the main characters in the novel. She is intelligent, proud, beautiful, and strong-willed. she is the strongest female character in the novel, neither as crushed by poverty nor as timid as Sonya. 
 Svidrigailov is as conflicted as Raskolnikov, first he's represented as a villain, he murders his wife, attempted to rape Dunya, tries to marry a 16 years old girl but still we witness Svidrigailov perform goods deeds, such as giving money to the family of his fiancee, to Katerina Ivanovna and her children, and to Dunya. Although he is a violent and sneaky and dishonest snake he's some how capable of doing good, when Dunya rejects him. Although the painful realization that she will never 
 love him forces him into committing suicide.

 "" Consciousness might be the promise of a future crisis, of a new view of life and of his future resurrection"" 
 This story isn't about who killed the pawn keeper, that we know form the beginning,it's about poverty, redemption, pride love understanding and forgiveness i cried at the end not because it was sad but because it couldn't have ended in a better way ."
5,Review to come but for now I absolutely loved this book and it was unlike anything I've ever read and I'm so excited for the sequel!!
4,"Written and narrated by Neil Gaiman, ""Click-Clack The Rattlebag"" is a short, chilling exchange between a young boy being escorted to bed, and his sister's boyfriend. Click-Clacks are scarier than vampires, probably made of dark, and will come in when you don't pay attention."
3,"I didn't learn anything from this book. But I did gain a greater appreciation for the good film versions of Bond. The literary 007 is smarmy and sexist. However, the women in the books are (in my opinion) a bit more smart and cunning than the film Bond Girls. I like both the films and the novels for similar reasons: the glamor and action."

 I feel like I've broken the sequel curse lately, having read two amazing sequels in a row! It gives me hope for the world! 
 Prodigy is amazing! (So many exclamation points are going to be in this review, get used to it). I feel like I can't even begin to describe it. I only finished it last night - having stayed up all night to finish it in one sitting and I'm still buzzing. 
 (On that note - I really need to stop starting books at night time. I am beginning to get seriously sleep deprived.) 
 This book follows closely in time from Legend - only 3 days or so after the events of Legend - and June and Day are on the run from the Republic. In order to save Day's life and try to find his brother Eden, June and Day agree to join the rebel group the Patriots. In exchange for their assistance the Patriots want June and day help incite riots between the already tense people and the leaders. They also have to assassinate the Elector Primo. 
 Day agrees, and June reluctantly agrees. 
 The things that make this book an incredible sequel are that the plot is strong enough to be a stand alone novel - it is action packed, well paced and answers a lot of questions raised in the first book. It deepens the world building, providing more background, history and context and also takes the characters to the next level - really getting into their souls and asking the hard questions. 
 June and Day's relationship is the most well developed that I've read in a while. I think something a lot of writers seem to miss when writing a romance aspect of a book (and sometimes even in romance books) is that the romance is still a sub-plot, it still needs to bring tension to the book. With romance plots the tension is obviously whether or not the couple will end up together, and a lot of the time you just know that they are going to be together and so nothing that happens gives you any sense of anticipation. In this case, Lu has done such a great job of developing very real flaws in the relationship with June and Day which really makes you question whether they will end up together. In places it's truly heart-wrenching to read. There is also a slight love-triangle/square. I actually don't mind the love triangle as long as there is tension - as in, you actually don't know who will end up together. There can't be a love triangle if you know that there is no chance of a couple getting together (cough, Twilight, cough). 
 I've kissed a few boys in the past...but Day makes me feel like I've never been kissed before. Like the world has melted away into something unimportant. 
 Outside of the relationship, as individual characters, June and Day are so realistic and their growth over this novel is beautiful. They are both dealing with the deaths of their family members and I loved reading how the each approached grieving. I really feel sorry for June in this book. Because she is such a tough character I sometimes forgot how much she has lost, and how alone she is. Then Lu would put in these tiny moments showing her vulnerabilities and it would just break me. 
 I am June Iparis, I remind myself. I'm not going to let him see the chaos I'm feeling. 
 The plot in this book is also very strong. You learn so much more about the relationship between the Republic and the Colonies, what the Colonies are like and the political climate of the Republic. 
 I feel like this book is what World After should have been like. 
 I feel like all books are now putting Hunger Games on the cover as a similar book - however I disagree with this one. I think this series feel more like the Divergent series by Veronica Roth. I feel like the way they both explore the issues of death and killing is more similar. Or maybe Day is more like Katniss and June is more like Tris. 
 Few people kill for the right reasons, but if any reason is the right one, it must be this. Isn't it? 
 And the ending - I have to know what happens next, straight away. I'm going to have to go out and scourer the local bookstores to try and find a copy."
4,"It took me FOREVER to get into this audiobook, but then I read, and liked ""More than This"" so much that I sort of forced myself to listen. I just finished it (after a listening binge), am too busy screaming ""noooooo!' ""whaaaaat?!?"" and ""OMFG I need the next book now!!"" in my head that I can't form a coherent critique. Off to listen to the next book (thank you, downloadable ebooks from the library!!)"
5,"Wut. Seriously though what the heck? Ok I'm getting ahead of myself, this book was phenomenal obviously by the rating I gave it. Kathy Reichs, you're the bomb. I've been with this series from the beginning back when I thought Virals was a stand alone. I deeply hope there is a next book to this series (she cannot possibly leave it like that). Now this book was different from the others. It was still you know the Virals taking care of business, but it was more hardcore. Which was like, whoa, this is a whole new level of crazy. There was some serious stuff going on and I didn't always like their decisions (I'm like Shelton, can we freakin' go to the police now?!) but they obviously handled it well. Now for the real talk (view spoiler)[ First of all Ben WTF. Like no. This is unacceptable. I totally understand Tory in the end not wanting to forgive you. I don't know that I could. I mean, you were unknowingly in cahoots with a flippin serial killer! Then you figured out he was a big fat red flag, you didn't tell your own pack!!! NO. NOT OK. And you were in a bad mood the whole book. Yes I get that it wasn't just a ""bad mood"" but until the end, I thought it was just petty jealousy over Jason! FYI, Ben, that is not the way to impress Tory. Piss her off, yes. Impress? WTF were you thinking. I betcha that if you would have just freakin come out and said what you felt, she would have said, ""Cool, yeah I like you too, Jason just doesn't do it for me, you do. Plus you're super hot."" (at least he is in my mind I mean you could fry an egg on the mental picture I've got of him) Tory never comes out and says her real feelings for Ben, but you can tell it's gonna happen. It's like Ross and Rachel, he's her lobster. But now I'm not for certain if they are going to happen because he went and mucked things up!! Holy crap she already knows you're cool Ben! You don't need to be anything else. All you needed was to TELL HER. Now you're expelled, which is stupid. And that is stressin me out. Ok rant over. (hide spoiler)] 
 The crime part of this book was fantastic. I had no idea what was going to happen next. It was so fun to read! (view spoiler)[ I really would never have guessed that the Gamemaker was pretending to be the forensic cop guy which the name escapes me. That was intense. I loved it. I really wanted to know how many times he'd done this crap before. I just wow. (hide spoiler)]"
5,"Full review @Scaredy Engines End of Line Library 
 Five QUINTILLION stars! Seriously though it has been such a long time since I stumbled across a book I love this much and to top it all off it's set in a place I visited a lot on holiday while growing up: Bangkok! 
 But this wasn't the Bangkok we all know, it was one that is a result of the aftermath of global warming and what humans are doing to the planet. I read this book while on holiday in Thailand so I got a deeper experience of the many culture points in the plot as well as (believe it or not) some nostalgia for my childhood days when we used to stay a month in Thailand every year at Christmas. But don't get the wrong idea, this was not a happy book, not even close it is dystopian after all. There were many interesting topics raised in this book as mentioned in the description and wow the author did a really good job of delivering."
1,"The Girl of Fire and Thorns was, unfortunately, disappointing. I kept reading it in hope to find out what raised such a wave of adoration, but, well, unsuccessfully. The book does have some pleasing moments, though: 
 - Hispanic elements - language, culture, places. 
 - A commonly flawed, far from perfect main character. 
 - Pace of the narration. 
 - Well-conceived, easy to imagine world. 
 As to the nays: 
 - Fat-hating, fat-shaming, fat-talking - that's all you get about the main character, Elisa, for the most part of the book. 
 - All the cracks and holes of the story are filled with religion. Unnecessarily so. 
 - Elisa is special, because she has a stone in her naval and everything about it made me nauseous. 
 - The way the author discards characters you thought to be essential to the plot (and the way the main character fails to react to any of it). Some reviewers say this is what makes The Girl of Fire and Thorns more realistic and appealing. Well, it just made me feel...fooled? 
 The book, indeed, differs from other yaf series, which is an achievement in itself. But it just wasn't my cup of tea."
4,"See my full review at my blog, The Bookaholic 
 Cruel Beauty is a re-telling of Beauty and the Beast. That much is noticeable right away as the story begins with a daughter arranged to be married to the town's mysterious and rumored villain--a hermit that lives amongst a run-down castle off in the distance. Sounds a bit like our traditional tale in many ways from that start, but there are also notable differences that made it stand apart and give the story its own voice. There are bits and pieces I thoroughly enjoyed, and things I nearly loathed enough to almost put the book down at times. 
 For me, this was one of those reads that I found a ""likeable enough"" middle-ground and by the end, I couldn't get past that little hump to say that I either loved it or hated it. It was an enjoyable read that I can honestly say was hard to put down, which is why I couldn't find myself marking this as DNF like I almost wanted to in a few areas...

5,"Aidan Aidan.. What a foolish man you are. No wonder Em call you a manwhore. Lol.. 
 Shouldn't skip this if you've read the #1. This is the ending for Em and Aidan. Plus you get to peek a bit of little man's life."
3,"Likely a story better left for the littles. I kept reading because I was very intrigued by the premise and the focus on storytelling, but it could easily have been half as long."
5,"Final Thoughts: *sniffles* I'm not sure whether I should be happy that the wolves reached their safe haven and that the characters came out of this predicament alive (or dead *looks away*), or be sad because this trilogy has concluded. It is one of those trilogy endings that bring out conflicting emotions, like yin and yang, opposites that only exist in relation to each other, smiles and tears. And with this end to the trilogy, we come to a close with the characters. Through all three books they have grown and matured, and we farewelled them at such a perfect time. But it did feel open ended so let's just hope that we will see these characters once again in the future. A perfect close for a perfect trilogy. 
 - 
 Forever felt like an almost entirely different book. At the end of Linger we see Grace finally become the wolf that was wrestling its way free, and with this change she has the duty to protect and save the wolves before it's too late and every single one of them is killed. While Grace has this going for her, Sam finds it difficult to accept that he has lost Grace now (and not himself), and he longs for his Summer Girl to return. Isabel and Cole, just like Grace and Sam, have important roles in the outcome of this trilogy, too - if not more vital. 
 There's really not much else to say considering the trilogy has come to the end. The plot stayed together and had continuity all the way from the first page of Shiver, through Linger, and to the last page of Forever. It was really just one big book split into three. Therefore, there's not much else I can say about Forever which I have already said in my previous reviews of the first two books besides just telling you what happens in this instalment. There's no huge change in plot or character, or even setting; Forever tied the trilogy's plot together perfectly. 
 I did wish however that there was an epilogue of how things progressed or continued on after the good deeds were done. In some books it doesn't quite work because what happens in them is to some extent almost too cheesy and predictable. But knowing Maggie, I know that she would make an epilogue that you would be falling head over heels for as you just want to know that everything is alright, that everything is happening for these characters (e.g. Sam's music career, or even Cole as some spontaneous scientist, and Grace, well, as a wolf. Not sure about Isabel.) This ending though has given the reader an opportunity to be creative (like I just was) and create your own happily ever after. 
 Am currently reading The Scorpio Races with open arms. It's Maggie! Looking forward to whatever else she puts in front of us as I'm sure it could be just as good, if not better."
4,"This book came to me on a strong recommendation. 
 That is to say, in my sister's infinitely more experienced opinion (as far as romances are concerned), this book was better than The Fault in Our Stars. 
 Having since read it, I haven't figured out why she bothered with the comparison to begin with. 
 Because it is just not comparable. 
 I guess in one respect, as it pertains strictly to the romantic genre, it is a better romance book. 
 More than that, it is one unfettered with the nonsensical burden of unnecessary drama or angst that seems to lately go hand-in-hand with romantic books and is very quickly tiresome and moreso annoying; like a kid sister that won't stop whining to you about first-world problems that really aren't problems, just whining for the sake of whining. 
 Mostly through its main character, the book completely strips itself of such complications and views it through cold hard logic; which while often weighed in truth, lacks the warmth and understanding of human frailty. Graeme Simsion however does not ignore that obvious deficit. He instead expounds on it brilliantly through a form of wry humour as well as the character's humble nature. It actually manages to make such unfeeling behaviour bearable, comical and ultimately forgivable. 
 And as a result, surprisingly lovable. 
 (Not to mention, for any who has actually dealt with those bound by logic, they are so often combined with a superiority complex that it makes them a most obnoxious character) 
 It is also a shrewd piece of writing in that the author never once broke character, even when the character himself was a very difficult one to manage throughout. For that, I give him full marks. 
 So why the 4 stars? 
 Well for one, the story while evenly paced, was perhaps a little too slow and bogged down with things that really didn't bear so much necessary repetition. I understand that the main character was a man of habit and routine, but listening to the inside of his head almost berate him for breaking said schedule every time he did, which in this book was often as a result of circumstances, quickly lacked impact. 
 While understandable and true to the character, it happened one too many times. 
 The ending also while satisfying to my sister felt a little bit deus ex machina to me. Not that the ending wasn't a satisfying conclusion, just that I've developed a real issue with deus ex machina's as a reader to the point that I'm probably hyper-sensitive to it right now. 
 I understand the value of a good last twist to close out a story. But an easy way out is an easy way out. 
 But I think what really did the rating in was the very fact that it came to me as a book that was supposed to be comparable to The Fault in Our Stars and ultimately fell short of those expectations. 
 As a romance book, I give it full marks both for its creativity and its humour. And in those things I agree that it was a much stronger book than The Fault in Our Stars. But I was expecting something a little more intellectual or thought-provoking from this book. 
 It is beautifully written fluff. And very cute. 
 But nothing that bent my mind and sent me soul-searching. Which was what I wanted from it. 
 More's the pity as it is really no fault of the writer's. And that shame is mine to carry ultimately."
4,"3.85 
 I enjoyed this book. I liked the friends-to-lovers scenario, it was what I was looking for and it worked really well in this book. I liked following the boys from childhood, seeing their friendships grow and develop. I liked all the characters...yeah, I just liked it!"
4,A nice departure for Ms. Weiner's normal storytelling.
4,"This is a beautifully written and well-researched tale of the last woman executed in Iceland. There is a crispness to Kent's prose well-suited the starkness of the landscape and Agnes's story. 
 Agnes' own first person present tense narrative, interwoven with the third person past tense narrative, worked to give an immediacy to her perspective, and to locate the reader quite firmly in her fear and her heartbreak. The characters are well-drawn, and the subtle shifts in their relationships with Agnes are executed with skill. Even with her prickly character, I became quite fond of Agnes myself and found myself tearing up as it came to the day of her execution. 
 Hannah Kent is definitely one to watch."
4,"I ended up liking this one more than the first. The first third was very close to the last book, but the rest had so many more new scenes and emotional development. I loved that we got to see more of them together at the end; that the HEA wasn't as simple as it appeared to be in Summer. 
 :) Definitely hooked on this author. 
 I have something like Spring to read and another of his fantasy stories. Can't wait!"
5,"""Failure doesn't define you. It's what you do after you fail that determines whether you are a leader or a waste of perfectly good air."" 
 If you need to find me, I have sold my soul to the Soul Catcher. 
 A Torch Agains the Night picks up right where the first book left off. Readers continue to follow the mysterious paths of Elias and Laia as they journey to Kauf Prison to rescue Darin. Meanwhile Helene has to deal with the responsibilities that came along with being the Blood Shrike. 
 Let me just say that the sequel to An Ember in the Ashes did not failed in making me want to read more even after it ended. I braced myself to start to this book because for the very first time I was scared for what was in store. After calming myself down, I followed a trail of torches that lit the path that the author intended for me to follow. There were plenty of times I wanted to take a detour and strayed from the path, but the author always had a way to pull me back in. 
 Unlike the first book, where there were only two perspectives; readers get an additional character point of view, Helene, in the second one. They allow us to get into the mind of the characters, and at the same time let us know what is going on around them. Laia and Elias provided the intel on the Scholars while Helene is our eyes and ears on the Martial side. 
 The author further developed the characters into ones, whose readers would think twice before they underestimate them. Laia and Elias continue to be strong and reliable characters. To them, giving up is not an option. Helene developed the most in terms of how she first was. She realized she can't be loyal to the Empire and follow her heart at the same time; it's one or other. 
 It is possible to feel empty after selling my soul to the Soul Catcher, but it feels even more when I finish this book. My soul wants to read more yet sadly it has to patiently wait for the third book. 
 Rating: 5 stars"
2,"You can find the full review and all the fancy and/or randomness that accompanies it at It Starts at Midnight 2.5* 
 I won't lie, I am pretty fascinated by the Lizzie Borden case. I think the fact that it has been unsolved, and probably will forever remain as such that makes it so compelling. And fiction based on the case has always been of interest to me, because I love to read different authors' takes on what may have happened. To read different accounts of who Lizzie might have been, who her family might have been. The psychology surrounding the case is endlessly intriguing, and makes for a pretty great read. 
 In this particular Lizzie Borden book, we see the perspectives from several of the key players in the case. They're shown mainly in flashback form, both leading up to the murders and afterward. I enjoyed the varying perspectives, as they kept the mystery going. It was also interesting how the author portrayed Lizzie- which I won't get into because that would be spoilery. 
 The main problem I had with the book is that it often seemed quite slow. There were large chunks that I felt like nothing was really being revealed, nothing was happening. 
 Bottom Line: While I enjoyed getting into the minds of some of the players in the Borden case, I do wish the stakes had seemed higher, that there had been more revelations.

2,"I liked the story overall, but couldn't connect well with the main character or her family. Grace Divine is a preacher's daughter. Very goody-goody. Daniel is the opposite but likes her softness or naivete. Another thing is that Grace is scared of werewolves and in these books it's more like a curse than anything cool."
5,"Stay with Me is the fourth book in her series and it's actually one of my favorites. No one can top Cam and his cookies, but Jax was pretty damn close. Holy hot alpha male! This was not only sweet, steamy and funny, but it had some drama, grit and angst, too."
2,"I was intrigued by the blurb. I love a bad-boy rock star just as much as the next girl.. but I should have gone with my gut and dnf'd it when I first felt the need. 
 Since I didn't listen, it is what it is and I'm sorry for the low rating. 
 Honestly, I didn't much care for Riley. I thought she was going to be sassy and headstrong from the beginning, but she turned out not to be. 
 I also found the connection between the two mc's to be too rushed and without merit. I didn't feel it. 
 And Jax. I knew there was going to be something he was hiding, something from his past... but I just couldn't grasp how we were introduced to it. The events that occurred seemed to come out of nowhere. It felt like I had turned the page and started reading a different book!!??

5,"I'm in loveeeee !!!!! :3 :3 This book was so beautiful !!!! 
 I love Nick ! 
 Nick Nick Nick !!!! Silly, beautiful, sweet and amazing boy !! Sometimes I just wanted to hug him and other times I just wanted to shake some sense into him for have so silly thoughts. He was so insecure and so afraid.. poor Nick he was a complete mess. But oh god him and Adam... So damn cute !!! I love them together. So many hot and amazing scenes that I felt that my heart was going to jump out of my chest. Jesus Christ and (view spoiler)[ they did it !!! (hide spoiler)] :D I wasn't expecting that and it was so hot and cute and perfect !!!! I love Nick !! :3 
 I love Gabriel ! 
 Jesus Christ Gabriel what was that ?? I was so not expecting to him to react like that !! I thought... I was so convinced that he was going to punch Nick for not telling him that he was gay and then everything would be okay... That they... Seriously I didn't see this one coming. Why Gabriel ? Why ? What he did in the end was amazing and really sweet though. 
 This was one thing that really disappointed me. Not just in Nick's book but also Gabriel's. They are twins and I love them and them love each other very much but in both books they are always fighting or not talking to each other and I HATE THAT. And for god sake, is only in the end of the books that things are good between them. I want more scenes between Gabriel and Nick !! I love them together. I want more !! I love Nick. I love Gabriel. 
 I love Michael ! 
 Michael !! I love him even more each time. Is an amazing big brother. His reaction when Nick tells him that he's gay was just perfect. Seriously I don't even know what to say.. Michael is amazing. Just amazing. 
 I love Adam ! 
 Adam. I'm so glad Nick found him. They are perfect together. And after all the shit Adam when through he deserves someone like Nick. And he's so strong and so comprehensive. Perfect !!!! <3 
 I love Chris ! 
 Chris was never one of my favorite Merrick brothers but in this book.. Chris was awesome. When he said ""I love you brother"" to Nick my heart just... I just wanted to cry of pried and happiness. :') 
 I love Hunter ! 
 And Hunter... god I feel so bad for all the bad thoughts that I had about him in the previews books. The scene before Hunter (view spoiler)[ caught Nick and Adam together was sooooo hot !!! And when Hunter caught them I was like ""Oh shit!"" (hide spoiler)] but Hunter really is a great friend. That he said about Gabriel: ""I'm not his best friend, Nick. You are."" ... Once again I just wanted to cry! I need more Gabriel and Nick scenes!!! 
 And I'm so sorry but I have to say this... The thought of Gabriel and Hunter making out... I would like to see that very much. (!_!) 
 Quinn. I'm not going to ruin my mood by talking about her. I don't like her not even a bit and this book only made my opinion of her even lower. I know that she has a lot of problems at home but .. the was she acts... And for what the hell?! When she tells Tyler about Nick.. I hated her so damn much in that moment. 
 I'm glad she's with Tyler. I don't like him all that much either so they are good together. He was good in the end and he's good to Quinn and I like that but that doesn't make everything that he did right. 
 I know I already said this several times but I have to say it again. I LOVE NICK AND GABRIEL AND I WANT MORE SCENES BETWEEN THEM. I would be awesome if Brigid wrote like a short story or extra scenes something between them. It would be just perfect!! 
 Only on book left and I'm so afraid of what is going to happen!! Please Brigid don't let let anything bad happen to Michael !! Please!!! 
 I don't want this series to over. I want more. I love this books so much."
3,"I definitely kept thinking this was by Janet Evanovich and that wow, this is a step out of her normal fare. Oops! 
 Seemed popular as the Overdrive queue was long. I find it to be a ""women in crisis"" of the fluffier and more superficial story level. In other words, a beach read and what does fall into ""chick lit"" for me. 
 It's a decent read for that classification. Fun. Doesn't really go deep into the emotions of the characters."
4,"I think that the HP series just gets better as it goes along. You really get to know and love the characters (well, most of them anyway). This is an interesting part of the series...I remember that I was always fascinated with how Harry, Ron, and Hermione figured out the truth about the Chamber of Secrets. I know that some people feel like the ending of this book is too similar to SS, but I disagree. Plus, this is the first glance we get of a Horcrux."
5,"My first 5 star rating for a book with only loathsome characters! 
 I have never before rated a book 5 stars if I didn't love at least one character. I loathed all of the leading characters. I found little to be redeeming in any of them. Despite this, Emily Bronte made me have sympathy for all of them and hope for each of them to have a more desirable outcome. Her writing style was exquisite. And I loved the descriptions of the moors, the mansions, the people. I loved the story within a story style of telling the tales involved. I loved that when Heathcliff was missing the question of his whereabouts and doings remained untold. I loved that Nellie told the story from her viewpoint which meant there were emotions, thoughts and actions that we couldn't understand. 
 The book is an intricate exposure of what happens to people when they live for revenge. Emily took Heathcliff down a very twisted path and allowed him to be very unlikable. 
 She allowed him to seethe in his own jealousy, anger and grief. She allowed him to be repulsive. And I am so glad that she did! 
 Some of the other reviewers disliked Emma Messenger's narration. I didn't have a problem with it. This is my first reading of the book, and know very little about the appropriate accents, so I believe that I do not have the knowledge some others may have. But I enjoyed her choices for the voices of the main characters and especially liked the sinister quality she gave to Heathcliff."
1,"This book begins with a great hook - a group of extended friends gather at a bbq where the cousin of the host slaps the child of another guest. One of the things that intrigued me about this plot was that I saw a similar incident play on in the first season of Mad Men. At that bbq in upstate NY circa 1959 no one batted an eye when the neighbor slap another neighbor's child. It was one of those ""can you believe people used to do that?!"" details that makes the show so addicting. In 2010 Australia (and presumably most places in 2010) the slap creates a much different result. 
 As much as I wanted to enjoy this book, I really struggled to get through to the end. This is a book I heard raves about on the Guardian podcast and was recently nominated for the Man Booker prize. I haven't seen it in my local bookshops yet so when I found it in NYC I snapped it up hungrily. Perhaps that anticipation is what makes it so disappointing. Each chapter takes us inside the head of a different character who was present during the slap. But while the first two chapters are integral to the incident (the host, Hector and his slapping cousin Harry) the book starts to drift farther and farther away with each subsequent narrative. While trying not to give too much of the loosely connected plot away, the ""legal"" aspect of the slap is decided a little more than half way through the book - leaving me to wonder what the heck the rest of the chapters were going to be about. Tsiolkas seems to let his plot spin out of control, meandering into too many irrelevant life paths. 
 These are not characters that I liked or wanted to get to know. Frankly I had a hard time envisioning them all as friends who would want to spend any time with each other although it does explain why they are drunk or high most of the time - to get away from each other and themselves. I've seen a lot of reviews comment on the mysogynistic perspectives of almost every male character, but Tsiolkas gives us some pretty unsavory female characters as well - all of them self righteous and narcissistic regardless of gender. 
 And despite all of my criticism, there were moments where I thought this book gave us glimpses of real relationships, the struggle of loyalty to family vs friends, the way friendships evolve over time to where you wonder if things would be the same if you met that friend today...these little moments are in there but buried under uneven plotting and one dimensional characterizations."
4,"I read this for a book discussion group, and I probably would not have picked it up on my own initiative, but I enjoyed it very much. The two main characters are engaging and memorable. The story is historically fascinating--I had no idea that children were stolen by various Native American tribes and then repatriated. The fact that there is historically a very low success rate in converting these children back to western culture is in itself fascinating. My only complaint is that the ending is not really plausible; he wouldn't have gotten away with it."
5,"This was so cute!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I finished this last night at 5 am so I couldn't write a proper review, and I still don't know what else to say other than, I LOVED THIS SO MUCH. Enemies to Lovers is my favorite trope, and this is definitely my new favorite contemporary. Also I don't think I've ever laughed and smiled so much while reading a book, this was unexpectedly hilarious. I adore Sally Thorne's writing style. 
 And now I'm going to have to take a break from the contemporary reading binge I've been on and start reading fantasy/sci fi again because nothing else I read in this genre right now will live up to this."
4,"I loved the first third of this book. The writing style felt very similar to To Kill a Mockingbird, and the story was lovely and intriguing in its simplicity, the way that TKAM is. And that flashback to Scout, Jem, and Dill playing revival (featuring Dill wearing a sheet as the Holy Ghost)...oh my goodness. So hilarious! 
 Then things change. I had heard about Atticus being a racist in this book, and as one of the millions of people who loves Atticus, I was understandably worried about that. When Jean Louise finds out about Atticus and Hank attending that meeting, the book changes a lot. The writing style changes: for the most part, it becomes a lot more scattered and less cohesive and simple. And from then on, the story is basically Jean Louise struggling mentally for a day or so before she confronts her father. 
 Here's how I feel about that aspect of the book simply in itself and not connected to TKAM: I found it harder to read, mostly because it got pretty political. I got the gist of what they were talking about, but a few things were a little fuzzy for me. I can see how this part is really applicable to what's happening in our country today: seeing how racism can exist in ways even in good people. And I can appreciate the theme of how it's not realistic to expect people to be perfect, even if they're your mentor or someone you really look up to. But in terms of actual enjoyment of reading: I enjoyed the first third much more than the rest of it. 
 And here's how I feel about the book in connection with TKAM. I love To Kill a Mockingbird. I still love Atticus. My appreciation for that book isn't lessened in any way, and Atticus' reputation isn't ""tarnished"" in my eyes. For one thing: Go Set a Watchman isn't a real sequel to TKAM. It was written first, and characters and parts of it were taken and adapted into TKAM. It doesn't read as a true sequel to TKAM: the stories don't match up. Hank (or Henry) supposedly grew up with Scout, Jem, and Dill, but he doesn't exist in TKAM. The rape case that is so prominent in TKAM is very different in GSAW (and had a different outcome). 
 I read Go Set a Watchman as the starting place for TKAM, and it made me thankful for the different direction in which Harper Lee took the story. The editor who suggested she go back and focus on Scout's childhood was a genius, because the flashbacks are the most vibrant parts of this book. For me, GSAW is a sort of alternate universe, rather than a sequel. From what I've read about Harper Lee's life, GSAW was probably very autobiographical, and it certainly seems that way from the extremely visceral reaction Jean Louise has in the book. It feels like Ms. Lee was writing from experience. So I don't mean to discount the issues that are tackled in GSAW, but logically I just can't see it as a true sequel. 
 It's a story worth telling and worth reading, in my opinion. It's different, and I'll always love To Kill a Mockingbird so much more. But I'm glad I read this one."
3,"Plots behind plots, plans beyond plans. There was always another secret. 
 3.5 stars. Mistborn was a great fantasy read - I loved the characters, especially some of the smaller roles like Spook. I enjoyed the writing, although the book can definitely be read by all ages, it does not feel like it was written for YA specifically. There is also no real romance, and the little bit we see feels real. The magic system is what really defines this series I think. The most important system is Allomancy, which allows its user to ingest and burn metals which gives them special powers. The burning of different metals causes different special abilities. Mistings inherit the ability to only burn one metal, but Mistborns can burn all. And this is not the only magic system described in the book, I hope to find out more about Feruchemy in the rest if the series. If this is a genre you enjoy and have not read Brandon Sanderson, you're missing out."
5,"Masked Innocence picks up right as Blindfold Innocence ends. Julia has just experienced a sexual experience with Brad and another man. They have decided that they are in this for relationship together, neither one is able to stay away from the other. The animalistic sexual hunger that was portrayed in Blind Innocence is in full force this book. Both Julia and Brad expand their sexual escapades in this book. I don't want to spoil the adventure for the reader by giving too much of the plot away, just know that the sexcapades are HOT!! Inferno HOT!!! <<< excessive use of exclamation point warranted. 
 Where Brad was raw and frank in Blind Innocence he is more conflicted in this Masked Innocence as Julia has done something that no other person has been able to make Brad do, he feels emotions when he is with Julia. Yes Brad has sex and has orgasm with anything on two legs, but I don't think Brad has truly allowed himself to feel too deeply for anyone since he was abandoned as a child. Brad is the type of character who has built wall around himself and very few people every really know the real Brad DeLuca. 
 Torre takes both Julia and the reader on a wild ride as she further explores Julia's sexual adventures and her new found sense of self. I am glad that Julia trusts Brad as much as she does. She comes to rely on Brad deeply. Maybe a little too much? This book has sex, suspense, danger and romance. I am the type of gal who trusts herself more than anyone else, so Julia's choices and mine would not line up, because this girl just might get burned. Intriuged, you should be, I highly recommend this read. 
 A review copy was provided by publisher."
4,I would say 3.5 mostly because it was very well done but super disturbing/sexual.
4,Keplinger takes on a challenging topic in a very realistic way. I recommend this book to everyone!
4,"If it wasn't for the ending, I'll probably rate this one a 5-star. Loved the first part till the middle, but as it gets to the ending, the character was just out of their minds! I almost fell head over heels with this one but the ending is a definite turn-off. URGH. :\ 
 Anyway, what I like in this book, is the imperfection of Dobbs (physically) since most of the books I've read, the main character is always skinny, long-legged etc etc. But this is actually the first book I've read wherein the main character is ""healthier than usual"", and she still gets the handsome guy. yay! 
 Overall, this is still worth reading :)"

 He loves me...He loves me not. He loves me . . . Or does he? All women love the charismatic Hamish Wolfe. The fact that he is a convicted serial killer locked away for life for brutally murdering three women and suspected in the disappearance of a fourth doesn't phase them. The proof of their love and devotion is in the hundreds of letters and photographs Wolfe receives weekly, many of them graphic, many of them proposing marriage. Devastatingly handsome with a charming, manipulative personality and a killer smile, Wolfe is always in control, an intensely compelling and lethal man. His fan club of dedicated groupies call themselves The Wolfe Pack. They are united in a fevered, obsessive passion on a mission to undo what they perceive as a gross injustice - Wolfe's incarceration. The Pack has set their sights and hopes on lawyer & true crime writer, Maggie Rose. Problem is some of these followers are a few bricks shy of a load - looney as the day is long. Are they also dangerous? 
 Maggie Rose is an eccentric, compulsive, gaunt yet beautiful woman who shuns the public eye even as she flaunts bright blue hair. Protecting her privacy at all costs, she lives as a recluse, avoiding interviews, and public appearances and only meeting with clients when necessary. Maggie has made a great deal of money by challenging the cases of convicted murderers and then writing books about them. She will only accept a case IF she sees flaws in the chain of evidence. Whether they are guilty or not is truly irrelevant in her eyes. Every client deserves to have every stone turned, every piece of evidence validated, every lead explored, every question answered. Maggie is good at what she does. She has represented seven convicted murderers in the past and gotten five of their convictions overturned. It didn't matter that she didn't believe in their innocence . . . in fact, she's pretty sure some of them were guilty as sin. It's all about winning. Can Wolfe and his followers convince her to take his case? Will Maggie fall under his spell? 
 Daisy In Chains is a psychological thriller that grabbed me by the throat and held on until the final shocking page. The story is revealed through three main characters in a brilliantly written narrative intermingled with emails, letters, and police and newspaper reports. Complex, multifaceted characters kept me off-balance - leaving me guessing, never quite sure who was telling the truth and who was lying. I quickly found myself lost in a sinister maze of twists and turns, frantically searching for answers as the author manipulated both the characters and me. The ominous atmosphere of the setting took on a life of its own, engulfing me with an edgy, almost spooky feeling of impending doom as I read late into the night. Several social issues involving discrimination of certain classes are interspersed and woven into the plot line, giving voice to the flawed perceptions of people who often judge others by class, body size, or celebrity status. 
 Like a puzzle with a missing piece, Daisy In Chains perplexed and taunted me as the suspense builds to the shocking, blockbuster ending. While I was able to find and place some pieces of the puzzle, the final piece eluded me until the very end. Brilliantly written, this is a psychological masterpiece! A Page Burning, Keep Me Up All Night Must Read!"
5,THIS IS THE KIND OF BOOK I WANT TO READ MORE OF
4,"I learned many new things and I laughed a few times as well. That's pretty much a win for non-fiction. 
 Humanity's impact on the environment tends to either be presented in a deliberately polarizing manner for political reasons or presented with assumptions of scientific knowledge which most lack. The author did an amazing job of explaining the science behind the impact in layman's terms without omitting details that frequently don't make ""news"" stories on the topic. She even took the time to explain how mistakes and theory discrepancies happen in science. Even better, she did all of this calmly by presenting facts and logic without resorting to emotional manipulation. 
 I loved the inclusion of small personal notes about the assorted scientists featured. While such asides don't contribute to the main premise of the book, they do make it much more engaging. Between that and her wonderful descriptive style, I found myself able to visualize her experiences and environments with a fullness usually only found in fiction. 
 There are two things which would have greatly enhanced my pleasure in this book. An insert of color photos of the assorted plants and animals discussed would be awesome. I did Google quite a bit while reading this and it would have been preferable to have photos right in the book.Additionally, a chart/timeline depicting the assorted eras and epochs mentioned in chronological order with dates and maybe a few sample organisms listed for each section would have been great. Perhaps with the mass extinctions and suggested range for the anthropocene marked as well? As clear as her explanations were, some information processes better in images than text. 
 Things I think should be changed before the final release: 
 I'm hoping the end notes will be numbered in text with subscript in the final edition. 
 The graph on page 16 is hella blurry. 
 On page 46 at the end of chapter 2, she first mentions that the megafauna extinction is becoming understood as being the result of the spread of modern humans. No specifics are gone into on this until page 230. This left me wary that she was going to start making assertions without any kind of backup in the beginning of the book and I felt a bit weirded out all the way through the book by that hanging thread even when it became clear that she was validating her beliefs with facts. As a reader, it would have been better for that statement to have been omitted in chapter 2 if it wasn't going to be developed for almost 200 pages. At the very least, it should be noted that it will be expanded upon later in the book. 
 Page 86, line 19, the paragraph that starts with ""The bolide arrived from the southeast..."" I'm assuming that ""doe to its trajectory"" (later in that paragraph) should read due ""to its trajectory."" 
 The last sentence on 113 going over to page 114 reads ""Change the atmosphere's composition atmosphere..."" Is that right? It seems like the second atmosphere is superfluous or at least awkward. 
 I would omit the bit about the gift shop cashier not showing Ms. Kolbert around from page 226. It comes across petty and unflattering to the author. Even if there were no other customers, it's a given in *any* clerking job that you don't leave the shop unattended. You can get fired for that. 
 I received a complimentary copy of this book via a Goodreads giveaway. Many thanks to all involved in providing me with this opportunity."
5,"*4.5 Stars * 
 I loved this book and I can't wait to read the sequel, even though it broke my heart many times. I almost cried at some scenes. The connection between the characters and reader is really good (at least it was for me). I had my percentage of annoyance with the main female character, Zoey, for a considerable part of the book. I found her a little immature taking in consideration the circumstances in which they were living. But, if there is something good on this book, is the development. Not only plot development but also character's development, and I'm talking about secondary characters too. Zoey grew up a lot throughout the book and I stopped seeing her as immature, instead, I found a very strong, courageous and determined young woman. I loved Ash, the main male character since the moment he steeped in. The romance on this novel is very good and I also loved reading about Zoey's relationship with her father. The story is good, the action scenes are great and the pace is perfect. However, I think some scenes were not necessary or were over detailed, while in other parts of the book I felt as if something was missing. I also found some grammar mistakes. But to be honest, I loved this book so much and I was so interacted with the characters, that I simply forgot whatever was missing. In general, the book is great, it's in my list of favorite books read this year. I totally recommend."
4,"Geeky fun. An engaging male adolescent fantasy, with ""I heart the '80s"" pop culture references galore. Gamer nerds rule, corporate drones drool. Don't overthink this one; just enjoy the virtual, interstellar ride."
2,"pretty good for an alternate universe House,MD fanfic."
4,"Very different but captivating. Writing, style and story were incredibly refreshing and new."
3,"This was nowhere near as good as the first one. The only reason I was still interested in this book was the romance but even that was infinitesimal. Now, don't get me wrong, it was entertaining, and not a total waste of time but still... there's room for improvement. But the second book is usually the hiccup in a series, so I really hope the third book gets better."
5,"So.....I loved this one. 
 It was a fast paced page turner that had me entertained from beginning to end. 
 Sarai was a good lead character. 
 Victor was sexy. 
 And because I'm weird and tend to fall for side characters...I loved Niklas. For some reason, even though he didn't have much focus, he became my favorite. (view spoiler)[ Really happy Niklas made it out alive, I was worried about that. (hide spoiler)] 
 Hoping the next one is just as good."
5,This and Thud! are my favorite of the Watch books.
4,"I didn't like this one as much as previous volumes. Probably because Marko is separated from his family for most of the book, and the focus on Marko's ex, although I do like the little girl the bounty hunter rescued from Sextillion. It seems like the goal is to get increasingly x-rated with the content. Plenty of violence and some really overly sexual imagery in this book. I still like the concept and the fact that it's narrated by young Hazel. Alana and Marko are compelling characters and their star-crossed love story definitely appeals. Not to mention cute little Hazel. I just don't think the storytelling is as strong at it was initially."
5,"I am sitting in a stunned silence as I have turned the final page of this book. The question as to what is in fact my favourite book has plagued my mind for years - never with an answer. 
 But alas, I have found it. We Were Liars is without a doubt the best book I have ever read. 
 I cannot begin to explain what this book is about because I will not do it justice (or will give away the fantastically shocking ending which I adore). All I can say in this sobbing state is read this book, for it will change your life."
2,"To see so many overly positive assessments of this very average novel is surprising. 
 I was in the mood for some nice military SF (hoping to find another John Scalzi) and the ratings & comments were promising or should I say deceiving? 
 Now there's nothing wrong with Terms of Enlistment and I do not regret having spend a day on it, but it is on the edge of standard to sub-standard military SF: the scenery leaves a lot to be desired as do the characters and the plot. Sadly, there is also no sense of wonder whatsoever."

 *Note: Some slight spoilers ahead 
 Born started off so promising. I was drawn into the story and loving it until about half way through. Then things started to fall apart a bit for me. Emma started to becoming super annoying and a lame love triangle was developing and I just didn't enjoy the last half of the book. A good idea, but the main character, or really most of the characters, got on my nerves by the end of the book. So much so that I didn't want to continue on to the next one. 
 Emma has been on her own for the past ten years. Ever since the world as we know it was destroyed and her father died. She has a pet wolf, but that has been her only companion since she was 9 years old. So she is not so good with people as she has hardly been around them. Her father taught her to survive, to take care of herself, to be independent. He taught her to not let other people in because that can get you killed. Stay by yourself, pay attention, don't do anything stupid and survive. So that is what she does. There are lots of bad people still living, seems like only the worst survived what happened, as well as the infected. I really enjoyed the world that was created. The ideas were pretty cool even if I don't know everything yet. The others, the infected, the breeding camps, everything was really fascinating and kept me wanting to read more. 
 So Emma is on her own for years until one night she gets a knock on her door. A girl, Anna, who is asking for her help. Her brother Jake is stuck in a hole not too far away and will surely die if she doesn't help. Anna doesn't care if Emma kills her just as long as she promises to help her brother. And this is where Emma starts to change. Unfortunately we don't get to see the change happen, we are just told it does. The book just skips time and Emma is all caring about these new people now and not going to kill them, will do anything to save them, etc. I didn't really understand since I didn't get to see the change, but I just went with it. 
 Then when Anna is in danger Emma runs off to save her. She meets some allies, a group of people who are actually living peacefully in the woods and trying to make a new life where they can. Through them she gets some help and starts to try and save everyone (though it was the beginning of Emma turning into a super annoying character). Once she meets everyone that is where the stupid love triangle comes in. She obviously likes one boy more than the other, but is very resistant to the idea. Plus the boy she likes is kind of a jerk and not cool at times. It was not so good. Then she risks her life to save one person, then decides she must save everyone! Every single person, except the people she indiscriminately kills because they are on the inside. Who knows some of them could be good people, she knows this as some of them helped her before, but let's not think about that. She gets all crazy by the end, runs off willy nilly and does whatever she wants. She won't listen to anyone, won't stop for a second and make a plan. Nope. If someone questions her she just gets angry and runs off by herself because that is smart. Good thing she is super awesome and nothing can stop her.... 
 She also is super judgmental of most of the other people she meets. She hates the girl who also seems to like the boy she likes. She even goes off victim blaming her for being raped which is a HUGE no no. She was horrid. Absolutely horrid to the girl who wears clothing that Emma deems inappropriate. Plus thinks she is a whore because of said clothes and that the boy she likes likes that girl to. Or at least used to. Her and her judgmental self got on my last nerve. The victim blaming was the last straw. That happened near the end and really made me say nope to reading more of this series. I just can't stomach stuff like that. Not cool. Not cool at all. I just wanted to tell Emma to get over herself and stop treating everyone else like crap because you think you are so much better than them. I hated it. Such a shame as I did really like the first half. I was all in and couldn't put it down until Emma because someone I hated. Oh well."
5,"I loved this book! If you are a child (or teen) of the 80s, there are more pop culture references to your formative years than you can shake a stick at in this book, which is just plain fun. The story itself, at least to a video game playing geek like myself, was also really, really good. Of course, I am, as noted, a gamer, and I've always found the concept of virtual reality fascinating. (If you also do, and love honkin' huge books, read Tad William's 4 book Otherland series, but I digress.) It read quickly, was well-written, and definitely grabbed my attention and made me read late into the night. I'm not going to summarize the storyline, as I am dashing on to goodreads and dashing off again, really, but read the blurb, and then read the book, 'k? ;)"
4,"If you are a fan of the paranormal genre, Kiss Me Deadly is a must read for you. I don't know about you guys, but I constantly feel as though I am being consumed by my TBR pile. (Get it? Consumed? Okay, moving on.) This anthology was awesome because it allowed me to get a sampling of some authors who novels I've been wanting to read, such as Sarah Rees Brennan, Carrie Ryan, Rachel Vincent and Michelle Zink. Thankfully, this anthology has motivated me to take a look at these authors, as well as a few others. 
 Kiss Me Deadly was a thoroughly enjoyable read for me, and if you follow my blog regularly you know that I took my sweet time with it. I think the best way to approach an anthology of stories or poetry is to read one and then let it stew for a few days, as opposed to moving on right away. I will admit that after reading several stories, the plots began to look a little similar, and that by the end I was ready to put this book down. There were some stories where I felt like the author wasn't giving me enough information, or the ending just kind of fell float. 
 Honestly, though, I'll definitely re-read parts of this collection. There was more than enough awesome to make up for the stories that were lacking. Instead of continuing this review by being vague or harping excessively on the negative, I'm going to write a little bit about some of the stories I found particularly noteworthy. 
 ""The Assassin's Apprentice"" 
 Kids, this is my idea of starting off an anthology right. This story had a great plot, a kick butt female heroine and an appealing male. Honestly, what's not to love? 
 ""Lost"" by Justine Musk 
 This story had a fantastic balance between intriguing and haunting, making for an atmosphere that drew me in. On top of this, it has realistically relationships and a beautiful ending. This is quite possibly my favorite story from Kiss Me Deadly. 
 ""Hare Moon"" 
 I confess: I have not read anything by Carrie Ryan, although I do have a copy of The Forest of Hands and Teeth lying around. Now I realize I need to remedy this ASAP. Ryan's writing was gorgeous and emotional. More zombies, please! 
 ""Familiar"" by Michelle Rowen 
 When I first started this story, I thought I'd really dislike it and that it would be far too bizarre for my taste. Instead, it turned out to be fun, adventure filled story. I wouldn't mind winding up in a bizarre circumstance such as the one Brenda encounters with her familiar. 
 ""Fearless"" by Rachel Vincent 
 Of all of the stories in this anthology, ""Fearless"" has stuck with me the most. While I do wish Vincent had been a bit more specific at times, the concept of the story is terrifying. I am still wary of falling asleep at night, even though I read this two weeks ago. 
 This is only the tip of the iceberg of awesome that you'll find within Kiss Me Deadly. If you love paranormal, I think you'll definitely find a story or two here you'll really enjoy. Thank you so much for the publisher for sending me a review copy!"
3,"i would have given it a higher rating if the author stick up with its plot. the New Hope gives the book a dystopian thing in the story. the twist with the Fraises(????) was not grand. I dont like it at all. I think I understand that the author wants the book to have problem that was caused its people but really, I think it was shitty. 
 I really really like Amy, she's a bad-ass, loves to rescue people. 
 I think thats my only problem with the book though some people compare it with 5th wave...."
4,"No spoilers for Hollow City, but proceed with caution if you have not read Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. 
 We rowed out through the harbor, past bobbing boats weeping rust from their seams, past juries of silent seabirds roosting atop the barnacled remains of sunken docks, past fishermen who lowered their nets to stare frozenly as we slipped by, uncertain whether we were real or imagined; a procession of waterborne ghosts, or ghosts soon to be. 
 Hollow City picks up immediately after the events of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. The peculiars have just lost their home and their headmistress, Miss Peregrine is stuck in bird form. They are headed to London to find other ymbrynes to help her. They are being pursued by wights and hollowgasts and are about to find that life in the wider world is full of dangers between a world war in the normal world and a fight for survival for peculiardom. 
 I was very excited when I learned this book was coming out. I have been waiting since I finished the first one. I have to say I liked this one more than the first if only because of the travels into the wider world. Meeting more peculiars was awesome, as well as exploring 1940 London. The writing was top-notch and I was hanging onto every word. I loved the photographs that accompanied the text and am happy the author got away from introducing every photo and let them speak for themselves. The last few chapters blew me away and I cannot wait for the next book in the series. 
 Maybe I'm a bit nitpicky but the only thing that annoyed me about the book is that the author referred to the monarch of England in 1940 as ""Her Majesty."" In 1940, the English monarch was George VI, most definitely not a her. It annoys me when people write fiction set in historical time periods and cannot get the basics right. 
 I highly recommend this book to anyone who read the first book and enjoyed it. If you like a unique, adventure story with a touch of the supernatural, this is definitely a series for you. 
 Paranormal Scavenger Hunt: ruins"
5,"Third person present tense, very real, great feelings, angst and very very hot sex. Great story."
4,"The Goodreads star tags don't really work for me for this book. 4 stars is ""I really liked it,"" which I didn't -- it made me numb, and sad, and creeped me out. Reminded me of when I was in high school, in a one-act version of Shirley Jackson's THE LOTTERY... Not a book that makes you feel good about being a human being. 
 But I admired the author's craft immensely. Hence the 4-star rating."
2,"I guess I forgot what this book was about by the time I picked it up, because it wasn't what I was expecting. But the whole cult ""community"" thing was pretty interesting. Lyla's inner-turmoil sometimes annoyed me though, and there is a pretty severe case of insta-love. I think I liked the first half a lot more than the second half actually. There was a lot of ""action"" near the end, but it seemed kind of contrived and Pioneer was a little over the top in his evilness. He had absolutely no redeeming qualities, I mean I know he was the bad guy, but we really don't know anything about him or his motivations, which I would have been interested in."
5,"Let us begin!! 
 **************THERE WILL BE SOME SPOILERS ************* 
 Okay, so I freaking hate Mehmed! He was alright in the beginning of the first book when him and Lada, and Radu were just friends. And then he becomes Sultan and Lada encourages him and he's a prat! First off, I don't like that crap custom of having the harem. He's in love with Lada but popping out kids. My arse! 
 And Lada and Radu just keep loving him no matter what. The hell? 
 Anyhoo, Lada is off trying to get her throne of Wallachia and she's having a very hard time. No one cares for her and no one wants her to be prince. < -- Yes, prince. Assassins are trying to kill her but Lada and her men take care of most of that and then Lada just starts taking her revenge. 
 Lada knew punishing Transylvania for everything that had gone wrong in the past year did not make perfect strategic sense. But it felt better than anything else, and so Transylvania burned. 
 I love Lada's men. They are very loyal to her for the most part. Bogdan and Nicolae hold a special place in my heart. I also fell in love with Hunyadi who was an enemy at one time but became a great friend to Lada. Then that baEURC/aEURC/tard Mehmed happened! 
 Lada asked Radu to come to her and help her but he's stuck so far up Mehmed's rear end that he doesn't go. He's in love with the jerk. Once again, what the hell? Mehmed is doing nothing in this book but using Lada and Radu. I really hope Mehmed either takes a turn for the better in the next book or that Lada kills him deader than dead! 
 I love Radu's wife, Nazira. She was so much fun and so smart! She had me laughing a few times. 
 Then Mehmed sends Radu off to Constantinople, he just sends him out to possibly get killed. I loathe him! Nazira goes with Radu, so there was a whole shaEURC/t show over there. 
 Lada goes through all kinds of hell. She even saw her mom which was beyond crazy train! 
 There are those that are killed of course and I wish they weren't but it is what it is. 
 Then Lada gets her throne and she's not all that happy with the way things have been going. I love her so much. She's bloody, brutal, but she takes up for those that need to be taken up for. 
 You better rock it in the next book Lada and not let anyone kill you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 She had done what was necessary. She watched as each body was removed. She would mark their passing, and acknowledge their unwilling sacrifice. Because with each body they drew closer to her goal. She clutched her locket so tightly that her fingers ached. 
 She was a dragon. She was a prince. She was the only hope Wallachia had of ever prospering. 
 And she would do whatever it took to get there. 
 Some court people thought they could tell her what she needed to do. Wellllllll, that didn't work out too good for them in the above excerpt =) 
 To Radu, my brother, 
 I do not acknowledge your new title, nor Mehmed's. Tell the lying coward I send no congratulations. He sent none to me when I took my throne in spite of him. 
 You did not choose right. 
 Tell Mehmed Wallachia is mine. 
 With all defiance, 
 Lada Dracul, Prince of Wallachia 
 Take that baEURC/tches!

5,Awesome!! Loved it :) good to know where these Bradford men came from :)
4,"I just read this and actually really enjoyed it. There was a massive plot twist at the end, without saying enough to give anything away, it definitely made me want to read the next one. The suspense got really good during it aswell, although I knew it could not be Noel, mainly because they suck at guessing who A is, I also knew that A was still out there, while they were trying to pin everything to Noel, A, or A's I should say, was digging up even more on the girls, setting them up for the fall. This book being the 13th definitely put my faith back in the series, whether or not it ends and the next book, or Sara Shepard keeps going until the girls are 40, I definitely want to read more."
5,"This cover really speaks to me. The image... the title... the position of the hand... 
 It says: ""The magician's lie is that, instead of making the doves disappear, she hides them in her butt."" 
 Right? 
 Pardon me, but... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! 
 No offense meant to fans of the book or the author, but the unintentional symbolism of the title and the cover is hilarious. Keep on keeping on, Greer Macallister. I'll give you five stars just for giving me a chuckle."

3,"Where the first book in the series was self-indulgently entertaining to read, this book kind of kicked it down a few notches. Oh sure, there's some eye rollingly bad scenes of the sexual and non-sexual kind, but ultimately this book just didn't deliver on the promise of Fifty Shades of Grey. All I can ultimately assume is that James just got a little bored while writing this one. 
 I do have to give credit where credit is due- James's writing style did improve in this book, although if she didn't grow even slightly as an author by this point then I'd have been surprised. Most should improve with practice, after all. The downside of this is that the Ed Wood badness of her previous writing style is what really made the first book such fun to read. There are some sweet scenes here and there, but in the end the best parts of the book were the minor characters, most specifically Christian's exes to varying extents. (Although one of them is portrayed in such a way that didn't really match up with later and more extreme actions.) 
 There's less sexual content in this entry, which I also think hurt the book. James comes alive when she's writing bad sex scenes and trying to shock. The general idea of the second book: the revealing of Grey's past and the progression of his relationship with Ana is interesting in theory, but I don't think it required 532 pages to tell. If this had been about 100-150 pages shorter, the story would have been much improved because the later half of the novel just dragged on. This is despite several revelations that are supposed to be gasp-worthy. 
 I liked the book well enough to warrant wanting to read the final book, but if the first book had been this dull I probably wouldn't have bothered with the next one in the series. It was just a disappointing read overall. My score is 2.5 stars, but since I can't give half stars I'll round it up to a 3."

 If I Lie by Corrine Jackson 
 Publisher: Simon Pulse 
 Publication Date: August 28, 2012 
 Rating: 4 stars 
 Source: Copy sent from the author 
 Summary (from Goodreads): 
 A powerful debut novel about the gray space between truth and perception. 
 Quinn's done the unthinkable: she kissed a guy who is not Carey, her boyfriend. And she got caught. Being branded a cheater would be bad enough, but Quinn is deemed a traitor, and shunned by all of her friends. Because Carey's not just any guy--he's serving in Afghanistan and revered by everyone in their small, military town. 
 Quinn could clear her name, but that would mean revealing secrets that she's vowed to keep--secrets that aren't hers to share. And when Carey goes MIA, Quinn must decide how far she'll go to protect her boyfriend...and her promise. 
 What I Liked: 
 I have not read many books dealing with the military (other than Something Like Normal by Trish Doller, which I read AFTER I read this book), so I was not sure what to expect from this book. I have to say, this book pulled at my hearstrings and made me want to cry many, many times (and I am NOT a crier, for movies or books or anyone). 
 I had a feeling I knew what was wrong with Carey, both physically, and why Quinn had to lie for him. I felt so bad for Quinn, because she went through so many awful things, in order to keep a secret. I really felt bad for Blake, because he did not deserve to not get what he wanted. 
 This story is so twisted, but in a bittersweet, heartbreaking way. Quinn cannot be happy no matter what she does. Blake cannot get what he wants. Carey cannot get what he wants. It seemed like there was no way that anyone could get any silver lining out of this situation. 
 I really liked the mutliple plots - of Quinn dealing with Carey's secret, and Quinn dealing with her mother, and Quinn's past being revealed. It made me sad for Quinn, sad for Quinn's father, and sad for Quinn's mother. I just felt bad for everyone, even though, in a way, everyone did something that was bad. I do not know how Ms. Jackson did it, but she wove this story in a way that made me hate and love everyone. I think if I had to really hate anyone, it would be Carey, for asking Quinn to keep that secret. Not because of what the secret was, but because he ruined her life by asking her to keep it. 
 I liked how the story switched from past to present. This kind of thing is either done very well, or absolutely abysmally. Ms. Jackson did a wonderful job with the switches. It kept me on my toes, to make sure I understood what was going on. And it was an interesting way of revealing Quinn's past and present at the same time. 
 The ending was very bittersweet, but I think it ended well. It is resolved, but there are some things about the end that not everyone will like. I completely respect Quinn's decisions. Honestly, I may have done the same thing if I were her. 
 What I Did Not Like: 
 I said it already, but I really did not like the fact that Carey asked Quinn to keep that secret, and I guess, that Quinn actually kept the secret. That is SO not something that you should ask a person to keep quiet. Obviously, there would be no book if Quinn had not kept the secret. But I still did not like this. Also, I really, really wish Quinn could have, um, had a nice ending with that nice boy, instead of doing what she did. But that's okay, because I completely understand why she did what she did. 
 Would I Recommend It: 
 Yes! This book is so bittersweet, but it is so, so good. And sad. And good. It's not a light, quick read, but it's definitely worth the time. 
 Rating: 
 4 stars. This contemporary novel is definitely one for the ages!"
1,Manipulative and contrived.
2,"I am not reading the entire book right now though I may go back to it. I just wanted to read the story famous enough to make the final question on Jeopardy...and described in Wikipedia this way: 
 ""first published in the June 26, 1948 issue of The New Yorker.[1] Written the same month it was published, it is ranked today as ""one of the most famous short stories in the history of American literature"".[2] It has been described as ""a chilling tale of conformity gone mad.""[3] 
 Response to the story was negative, surprising Jackson and The New Yorker. Readers canceled subscriptions and sent hate mail throughout the summer.[4] The story was banned in the Union of South Africa.[5] Since then, it has been accepted as a classic American short story, subject to critical interpretations and media adaptations, and it has been taught in middle schools and high schools for decades since its publication."" 
 I always wonder how those rankings are determined.... 
 Are you curious enough to read it?"
5,"This was even better than Claimed. I couldn't stop laughing. I think it was because Baird always knew what he was saying to Liv was provocative and dirty, whereas Sylvan is being serious as a heart attack. when he makes these outrageous sexual comments. He might as well be reading the Wall Street Journal. 
 I have to hand it to Ms. Anderson. She has a real gift for making sex NECESSARY FOR SURVIVAL in her stories. I keep reading to see why it is they HAVE to get busy this time. 
 Favorite Part: The Tharp. It's like an X-rated Dr. Seuss creation. 
 Sylvan is definitely my favorite Kindred Warrior so far."
4,"This is a fantastic book. I was really in the mood for a fantasy book when I started, but it quickly grabbed me."
4,"Better than expected but it kind of dragged toward the end. I had the mystery answered a few chapters in so it wasn't much if a shock really. At first, I didn't care for the second person voice, but grew accustomed to it as I read. It actually fit the story rather well. I found Judith a wonderful MC; her strength and endurance while faced with cruelty were amazing. I may have to have another read through soon."
2,"This book was OK. The world building in this book was very good. The descriptions of everything were also very good. Other than that, this book was pretty bad. The characters were poorly developed and I didn't feel any connection to any of them. The story was confusing, most of the time, I didn't know what was going on or why things were happening. I really didn't like the whole young adult aspect with girls being popular and whatever....boring! But I knew it was a young adult book so I didn't really hold that against it. The main thing wrong with this book was that it was hard to follow, I didn't know what was going on, who people were and why things were important. 2 out of 5 stars."
4,"Binti is the first of the Himba people ever to be accepted at Oomza University, the finest university in the galaxy. But in order to take advantage of the scholarship, she'll have to leave her family, her village, her entire way of life, and travel among strangers (her fellow students) who neither understand nor respect her traditions. 
 This is a coming-of-age story, an adventure, a buddy road-trip, and a space opera all in one small package. I loved Binti. She's resourceful, mentally and physically strong, a loyal friend, a compassionate person, and a canny negotiator. I loved the way that she slowly developed a relationship with Okwu, the young Meduse warrior (?), carefully observing and strategically offering information and help once she understood the issue. 
 Science fiction is not my favorite genre (understatement), but I might read more of this series."

 Honestly, there's just nothing that makes The Moon Dwellers unique."
0,"Let me get this rant out of the way: 
 I find Blue highly annoying. In the last book, she clearly felt attracted to Adam and had some feelings developing for him. She was also clearly attracted to Gansey, but not in a way that was ever directly addressed. In this book, boom, she doesn't even seem attracted to Adam. I get it. Things change. People change. Feelings change. It is perfectly okay to realize that you didn't like one person as much as you thought or that you like someone else more than you thought. What's not cool is the way she strings Adam along because she would have PREFERRED to like him instead. It's been, what, six weeks since they started dating? Adam thinks she is his girlfriend. She goes along with that, but when he tries to kiss her, she freaks out on him (and we know why, but he doesn't) and is all ""no means no, and isn't that good enough?!"" 
 Yes, no means no. Yes, that needs to be respected. Absolutely. 100 percent. But what pisses me off here is that she's saying these things not because she feels she is ""too young"" to kiss, like she told him. She just doesn't want to be with him. And she's trying to make HIM feel guilty for his feelings. She seemed to reciprocate them in the previous book. Fine, she changed her mind. So END it. Don't throw out feminist sentiments as a tool to make someone feel guilty when they shouldn't. He apparently hasn't tried to kiss her again in six weeks-- that's a pretty long time! And when he finally asks her why she won't kiss him, she's all, ""I want to be more than just a pair of breasts to you! Why can't you want to do friend things with me instead of wanting to kiss me?!"" Um. Because he thinks you are his girlfriend. Because you have been dating. Because a romantic relationship is NOT the same thing as a ""regular"" friendship, and it shouldn't be! I don't treat or view my husband in the same way as I do my friends because THAT WOULD BE STUPID. It's a whole different level. That doesn't mean we don't talk and laugh and joke with each other-- it's just that we are more than that, too. And for her to act as if he is somehow being the jerk by wanting to kiss her PISSES ME OFF. The fact that she uses things like ""no means no"" and ""I'm more than just a pair of breasts"" to try to make HIM into the jerk PISSES ME OFF EVEN MORE. 
 And after all this, what does she do? 
 Go sees Gansy. (view spoiler)[And pretend kisses him. Because OF COURSE. (hide spoiler)] 
 It is also somewhat indicated that part of the reason she no longer likes him is because he is angry? Like, at the beginning of the book he kicks a box when he is mad about something/arguing with her. Okay, that's not the greatest thing ever... But, my words. He JUST left his abusive home, he's working three jobs, living on his own at 17, and SACRIFICED a part of himself to the ley lines! He's at the breaking point, have a little compassion!!!! That needs more exclamation points. !!!!!!!! I mean, she doesn't have to kiss him or be with him out of compassion. But she can be a little more understanding. She could have not made it worse by leading him on. She could have been HONEST with him instead of acting like he was the one doing something wrong. 
 But, no. Of course it's all Adam's fault! He didn't do what Gansey told him to do, which is just the worst thing ever. How DARE he not do exactly what Gansey wants/tells him to do. Quick, Adam! Go apologize! You should know better than to not listen to rich people!!!! 
 (I don't really like Gansey either.) 
 Having said all that, I stayed up until after midnight reading this book and immediately bought the next, despite only having $7 in my personal spending account. I like most of the characters and tolerate the rest pretty well. I found Ronan's story line compelling, although there were parts where I definitely wanted to be like, GET ON WITH IT ALREADY! 
 This is definitely a slow-burn, character-driven book. Plot-wise, not much really happens. It's all about the characters. Which I love (except when we are learning about Gansey and Blue, obviously), but it might not be for everyone. 
 I'm getting old. I try to remember what a book was about and draw a complete blank. Here's a summary to help me out a year from now when that happens: 
 (view spoiler)[ 
 Ronan is definitely gay. We learn a lot about his emotional and mental struggles over this fact while not actually saying that he is gay. Most of this book is about his struggle to accept himself. I THINK he does by the end of the book. Probably. 
 Oh, and he also learns to better control his dream powers. This other guy, Kavinsky, also has the ability to bring stuff back from dreams. He is also probably gay. He teaches Ronan about the dream ability. But only Ronan is actually a Greywaren. 
 Random bits: Blue and Gansey moments. Adam is losing time/seeing things. Noah is hardly in this book. When Ronan uses his dream abilities, it messes with the ley line's power. Adam has to fix it. Persephone helps Adam and there is a line about her ""coming back,"" so there is probably more to her story. Blue is feeling left out because she is not male or psychic, which apparently means that she doesn't think she fits into either group of people she is around. Mr. Gray is a hit man-- he killed Ronan's father and is currently dating Blue's mother. He was sent to find the Greywaren. He is a big part of this book as several chapters are told from his POV, but I didn't remember to add him until now-- which is probably how he would like it. Adam is Ronan's second secret. And if this ship doesn't happen I am going to be PISSED. There is a reason I've been staying up so late to read these books! I shipped them from the moment they first interacted in Raven Boys. FANGIRL LIFE!!!!! 
 So, yeah. Not a lot really happens in this book. Oh, they find a really old shield and really old car wheel which probably belongs to Gansey's car which means that somehow it existed centuries ago. And Blue's mom disappears. But these are all kind of secondary to Ronan.

3,"I am thoroughly enjoying this series. I could only truthfully give this one 3 stars, but I'm late at writing my review and I know I have already rated the next one 4 stars so don't be disheartened! This entire series is well worth the read although I admit I am only on book four out of five. I just already know that I'm going to be reading them all. 
 I have mentioned in a previous review that these books aren't perfect. I have to mention a few of the small things that bugged me the most and brought down my rating - 
 *Editing - there were a lot of errors in my copy of the book e.g. their instead of they're and other typos. Often this sort of error will completely snap a reader out of their 'zone' which is NOT a good thing. 
 *The characters - A lot of the decisions felt forced and slightly out of character coming straight off the first book. Not only that, but the characters at times seem like they are just going through the motions that are required to get us from a) to b) in the book. Each of these decisions/actions was a plot device but could have been better written to make it more believable for me. Elena and Lucian's relationship wasn't easy, but it did seem like there wasn't quite enough substance to it for them to be so entirely in love 
 *The events - sometimes I think the author needs to step out of the characters shoes and look at the happenings of this story as a world wide point of view. What effect would these events have on the rest of Paegeia and what would be the overall reaction? I know we're kind of viewing things from inside a bubble here, but there is talk of the rest of the world and sometimes I don't think the impact is felt hard enough all around or explained well enough in the book 
 *The Dialogue - I also have a problem with the dialogue at times feeling a little flat - hardly any of the characters seem to have their own inflections. Also the use of adverbs and adjectives a lot of the time (I said evenly, Sir Robert said confidently, she said smiling, She said with a wink, Isabel said with concern, ""This is so exciting,"" Lucille sang, Becky shrieked). 
 *Concentration on unimportant things - sometimes the author seems to get diverted with describing things that aren't overall notable or even necessary to the plot and this can distract the reader from the essence of the story. This book lacks a little focus. 
 Don't get me wrong - I do like this series, a lot in fact. It has all the makings of being incredible - an interesting, well thought out and fairly well built world, an exciting set of characters that the Author is able to build upon throughout the books, a great story line that the reader can see has been carefully considered and planned and it has managed to keep me hooked. I am definitely invested in this story and these characters and will be continuing to read through the wee hours of the mornings until I'm finished!

 I couldn't put this down. The Faceless were terrifying, but even more terrifying were the people Brady had to deal with.

4,"What a delightful little read! I don't know how Robin Sloan did it, but he managed to gather together some of my most favourite things in the world (and some not-so-favourite things) and wrote a story around them. Who wouldn't enjoy a book with: 
 - mystery 
 - history 
 - roleplay 
 - Harry Potter references (!) 
 - fantasy 
 - an incredibly nerdy smart woman who doesn't fit any female stereotypes 
 - and BOOKS 
 This was like a birthday gift, customised to include everything I love. Did I mention that no one is actually dumb or annoying in this book? This is about a bunch of super-gifted people who don't waste their time and lives doing drugs, drinking incessantly or being pathetic about their love / sex lives. They are busy doing things they love and enjoying sex and love and friendship. Yay!! 
 And guess what - there is a scene where a bookshelf swings open to reveal a secret passageway. That's orgasm material right there! 
 The story starts off with Clay (our protagonist) seeking a job during the downturn. He sees that a bookshop is hiring and walks inside. This simple step would change his life forever. He gets the job along with some curious instructions and some even more curious customers. Slowly he, and his group of friends unlock the key to the secrets. The only setback is that the climax is more of an anti-climax. But the delight of this book is in the journey, not in the destination."
5,"As usual with most Patricia Briggs novels, this one swept me up into a world more coloreful and enticing than the last. The level of suspense in the novel had me biting my finger nails; it was the kind that made me remember why I love this author and allowed me to forgive the last Mercy Thompson novel (River Marked). Add to it an explosive unexpected ending that will affect both series, and you have perfection. Though we have to wait one year for the next Mercy Thompson and two years for the next Alpha & Omega, as long as the quality is as great as this novel, the wait will be well worth it."

 Rating: (4.5/5 stars) 
 Jenny Lawson is also known in the online world as ""The Bloggess"", with a popular blog of which this book shares some of those anecdotes. Growing up with a taxidermist father, Lawson and her younger sister were constantly surrounded by bizarre things and events, from squirrels in boxes to ""turkeys"" following them to school. This book is a collection of some poignantly hilarious life stories that has gotten Lawson to where she is today. Told in her distinctive voice, the stories range from a good ol' narrative storytelling to a Post-It note argument to recounting events via blog entries. 
 This book had me from the first page of the first chapter. I must have read that Starbucks/Doctor story to countless numbers of friends because of how hilarious I thought it was. I loved Lawson's style, the spastic, off-on-a-tangent way of telling her stories, complete with footnotes and ""editor"" interjections! As ""evidence"" of said stories, the book was interspersed with some small black & white photos (which I often found hard to really make out what it was clearly... would have loved if it was a bit bigger or in colour). While most of the book had ridiculous moments, it was the chapter about her meeting fellow bloggers for an outing that I felt really connected to. Finding some fantastic kindred spirits that don't judge and are supportive of you because of a shared, connected interest. 
 The stories our often outrageous and almost always hilarious. You know the saying, ""it's funny because it's true""? All the more relevant with Let's Pretend This Never Happened. So crazy, you can't make this stuff up! (And honestly, how can you resist that adorable mouse on the cover??)"
5,"This is a beautiful, depressing dystopian novel about a society where men are the heads of the household and women aren't allowed to gather in groups of more than two. The story slowly ekes its way out in beautiful prose, narrated by various young women that live in the village. A very difficult and depressing read at times but the author handles a difficult subject very well."
4,"I really enjoyed this book. I liked the ending...well, most of the ending. Of course some things happened during the story that I didn't like, but you get over it. =) 
 Edit: Just finished this book again in preparation for the movie this weekend. Loved it just as much as the first time I read it."

 Ugh, I thought it would only be right to review this since I reviewed The Selection and The Elite. I am also needed to really exhaust my bookshelf for content for my blog. So here it is. 
 Basically, I suggest you read my reviews of The Selection and The Elite because a lot of my thoughts from those reviews still stand. 
 I feel like the plot was absolutely exhausted, I don't think it was necessary to have three books, two yeah okay but not three. You could tell because the plot was everywhere, everything was pretty random and didn't contribute a huge role towards the end and I'm sort of confused about it. I expected everything to be tied together and for things to be more final but nothing really happened. The series didn't really end with a bang for me, I mean it did end with something but for some reason it didn't just leave me feeling like it was finished. I felt like there should have been more, it kind of just fizzled out. It felt like there should've been more but there wasn't. It left me feeling a bit confused. 
 Also, I wanted to mention this in my last review but decided to leave it out for this one. America makes a ridiculous amount of mistakes. Not just 'oh whoops, my shoes on the wrong foot, silly me' no, it's more like 'maybe I should embarrass the king on live tv while the whole country watches, good idea'. How can someone make this many dumb mistakes, does this girl have no awareness of consequences? And every single time she's like crap, I screwed up again why does this always happen to me. Maybe you should think at least one step into the future, maybe? America literally doesn't think anything through. I've definitely made my fair share of mistakes but certainly not on the scale she has. Would she not learn? Like 'oh maybe I should think my next public appearance through a bit more and not do something like that' ugh ugh ugh. She's so frustrating and she just got more frustrating as the series went on. 
 Also, for some unknown reason I can't stop thinking about bloody Maxon and America. Why can't I go to sleep without thinking about them? I don't bloody know. I'll be in the middle of maths class and then I'll remember that one thing Maxon said to America that was sweet. Has Kiera Cass brainwashed me? I don't know and I hope I can move on soon. I also read this series incredibly quick and I don't know how, I haven't read like that in ages. It definitely got me out of a reading slump. Mostly, I'm just very confused about why these books have me feeling this way but I'm kind of happy they have since I haven't felt this much about a book in a while. 
 All in all, the series was okay. I can't say much more than that, it definitely made me feel all sorts of things which I guess is pretty good but it just was so frustrating. Maybe had America had more common sense, I'd have been less confused about my feelings on the series but I just don't know about it. I definitely will give The Heir a try because I know the bachelor thing is right up my alley and maybe the characters will be more bearable, hopefully."
5,"What word is there for the way summer tastes, the accumulation of sunlight in the air like a head of sweet foam, the snap and fizz of fireworks, the heat that never relents? 
 What is this book? 
 The best book I've read this year. Possibly the best book I've read in the past five years. Perhaps the best book I've ever read. 
 I mentioned in my review of Unteachable that Leah Raeder's style reminds me why I'm studying Literature. This whole book reminds me why I savage through decent book after decent book in search of the one that shows what written art should be like. 
 One thing that should be clear: Black Iris is a very difficult book. It is extremely heavy, in the way literary fiction often is. There are so many layers to this story that I feel like I will be rereading it for the tenth time and will still notice something new. It's hard to explain without giving out spoilers, so I will just repeat: this is what written art should be like. 
 I bottle up my hate until it ferments into poison, and then I get high off the fumes. 
 I must say that this book is not only heavy in the literary sense, but also theme-wise. Drugs, manipulation, unhealthy relationships, unhealthy lives, it is all there, tangled in such a way in a plot so carefully crafted that you feel anxious every second you're reading. This is not the book you read to escape reality. This is the book that from the first page showers you with reality and says, ""I'm just getting started. There's a storm coming."" 
 It's got a very easily unlikable protagonist, and yet, somehow, I found myself sympathising and celebrating with Laney time and time again. Leah has a way to pull you in the head of her characters, and, even though I disagreed with Laney's actions ninety-percent of the time, I still couldn't help but eagerly wait to see how it would plan out and worriedly wonder what I would do in her place. My INTJ soul connected to her. 
 The secondary characters were also so well-developed it hardly felt like commercial fiction. I know I keep comparing Black Iris to literary fiction, but there's something about this book that makes me feel that, if I gave it to one of my professors without saying anything about it, we might get some interesting feedback. And that's coming from someone who more often than not prefers commercial fiction over literary snobbishness. 
 ""I feel crazy,"" she said, running fingertips down my cheeks like tears. ""I need to get out of here."" 
 Now, back to the writing. I've saturated this review with quotes, I know, but that's because I couldn't choose just one. My e-book is more highlighted than not in many pages. The imagery Leah created, the way feelings and places and people are described, are just utterly beautiful. It's the sort of writing that makes me simultaneously want to write ten thousand words and never write again. When I closed the last page, it made me want to start reading again just to bathe on the words and it made me want to start translating it, because that's what I do when I love something so much I can't stand it. 
 Just to conclude, on a side-note, I've seen some people complaining about the timeline, saying it was confusing, but I didn't even notice that until I started reading other people's review, long after I was done with the book. I don't think it's confusing at all. The book actually sort of prepares you for it (or at least it felt like this to me). There's something in the way it opens that already says, ""This is not your typical NA book."" And that was enough for me to read it like something other. 
 All-in-all, I am utterly in love with this crazy story. I recommend it to anyone who loves a well-written, well-told tale. I will remember Black Iris for a very, very long time. 
 Two girls, cherry-mouthed, glitter-lashed, our skin luminous with moonlight and sweat, making out beneath pennants that still shivered with the afternoon's boy bravado."""

 My review in French: http://featherandink.blogspot.fr/2012... 
 The inspiration from Frankenstein is there. A little something from Everwood as well. I'm afraid it doesn't make it good enough though. 
 The characters, Emma and Alex, are really nice and endearing but the whole story is just disappointing. 
 The plot takes a while to unfold and the only reason the story takes off is because Emma finds out the big bad secret and does...nothing. That's right. No explanations. She's freaked out and scared but she does squat. 
 Completely dumb and unbelievable. 
 She sees her dead boyfriend in her new one and there's a explanation but it's lacking. You have no explanation as to why villains come to know each other, why the bad guy really does the things he does, etc... 
 For more than 3/4 of the book you read about this relationship between Emma and Alex and her conflicting feelings about him and her memories of Daniel and so on. It drags on and on and on until BANG, you finally get to the point, she does the dumbest thing and it all goes to hell. 
 Of course, we had to have a happy ending (rolling my eyes...) and it just feel way to convenient and easy. 
 I guess it had a lot of promising stuff in there but, in the end, it was not good enough for me."

 I don't even know what to say about this book. This book felt like it was told by someone in an altered mental state. I can't say it put me in a great mood. Not to mention the extended angst. A part of me really didn't like Kit -- everything about him that pissed Helena off about him pissed me off too. I also didn't feel like he gave enough of himself for me to fall for him. But, at the same time, I wanted to seem them together. I would have liked more time with (view spoiler)[Kit and Helena together (hide spoiler)]. 
 Also - WTF was the storyline with Muslim? That was kind of out of left field and overly short. It almost felt like more was originally written and then the author was advised to clip it. I wouldn't have clipped it. For a second there, I started to believe that (view spoiler)[this was becoming a vampire book and Helena got bitten by Muslim and turned into a vampire (hide spoiler)]. 
 The Neil storyline was pretty brief too -- there is mention of his grovelling, but I didn't really connect with it. Actually, half the time, I felt like I was drunk, swirling around in circles, while reading this book...and I am completely sober. 
 I think this book could be part of a series, with a book for Muslim and a book for Greer and maybe a novella from Kit's perspective. 
 Here are some quotes that resonated with me: 
 ""When people resolve themselves to something, it becomes very difficult to feel anything but that resolve."" 
 ""I've noticed that people don't really look you in the eye, because their eyes are somewhere else. Pointed inward."" 
 ""Don't be upset that you can't attain constant happiness. It's the quickest way to feel like a failure in life. If each of our lives represented a page in a book, happiness would be the punctuation. It breaks up the parts that are too long. It closes off some things, divides others. But it's brief--showing up when it's needed and filling tired paragraphs with breaks. Being content is a more attainable constant state."" -- Thanks Tarryn -- Something I needed to read today. --"
4,Again the development between Jace and Clary really drives my enjoyment of the series and this book really impressed overall when normally I never enjoy the second books in a series anywhere near how much I enjoy the first. I loved everything about this.
5,"This book has my favorite and least favorite story from the series. Dark angel is okay; it is not the best, but it is not the worst. It took me a while to actually get around to read it, but I got there eventually and didn't hate it, so that is a good sign.. right? The Chosen is my favorite because of the whole enemies turned lovers. The mc of that story is just a total badass and Quinn is to die for. The plot is also great and breath taking; it still has many holes, but the excitement is just overwhelming. Soulmates is great too, but it is not on my favorite list. It probably place in the bottom middle, but that is just because there are so many great stories in this series. Don't expect Shakespeare and you will have fun reading this series."
5,"You don't like this series? Well, fuck off then. You and I are N-E-V-E-R going to get along."
5,"It's a straggle between facing life and death and the poetry in the story is so heart flowing. As much as I want to make my review long, I'm not taking the chance and spoil people. Yup! I just slammed this book with 5 stars!!"
4,"This is a short story that is really well written and beautiful. 
 We have a serial killer who is taking a girl a year. But, we also have a crazy f-ed up town that does absolutely nothing about this situation. They just worry every year about which girl will be taken, but they don't actually do anything to catch the killer. Hmmm... sounds like either the laziest police in the world or that the police are actually the ones killing the girls.... Either way, it sucks to be a girl in this place. 
 So, our heroine, Verena, actually has the nerve to write an article about the killer, called the Maiden Thief, wondering why nobody is doing anything to catch him. 
 The power of the press is evident. No, this doesn't call the police or people of the town to try and find the guy - it makes the killer target her family. 
 This story has a bit of a Grimms fairy tale quality to it. You will like it in the end, but you will also rage at the patriarchy until then. 
 Thanks to Paige for recommending it. She wrote an actual good review here: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."
1,"WTF Roald Dahl. WTF? 
 This is a children's book? Where's the moral? 
 (view spoiler)[Oh yeah, let's completely lie to a woman that I have creeped on every single day and then continually lie to her. Then when the lie has become so big, ask her to marry me which she accepts! And then we live ""happily ever after"". 
 So what are you telling kids, Roald? Lie to that hot piece of ass so you can then get in her pants? Fuck you. (hide spoiler)] 
 I almost gave this two stars because Quentin Blake's illustrations are on point as per usual but the story. The fucking story."

3,"City of Bones (The Mortal Instruments 1) by Cassandra Clare 
 I did it. Finally. I started The Mortal Instruments, and I'll be damned if I didn't enjoy it. 
 Clary (though I hate that name) thinks she's a normal, everyday human being, but when she sees something unexpected and horrific at a club, her world starts to unravel before her eyes, and she must search through her forgotten past to discover who she really is and how she can save those she loves. 
 Put like that, it reads just like every other YA novel these days. And in some regards, it is. There's a YA formula for a reason: it works. 
 The fact this book came out in 2007 and I just read it in 2015 probably taints my perspective on this series as well, as I would have been a lot closer to the characters' ages in '07 (I would've been 20) as opposed to now, when I'm 27 and have read a lot more similar-sounding stories since. That being said, here are my thoughts: 
 I enjoyed the Supernatural elements of the book (though I don't watch the show), with the Shadowhunters and the demons and the Downworlders; I liked the concept that ""all the stories are true,"" which means beings like vampires, werewolves, faeries, mermaids, etc exist. I even enjoyed the slight political-class drama between the Shadownhunters and the Downworlders, though some of the backstory was slightly confusing. 
 I also really liked Jace and Luke. Clary wasn't particularly my favorite, though it was nice to have a heroine who wasn't automatically an amazing fighter, though her skills with the runes did come super fast to her at an advanced level, which I'm not sure I totally buy. Jace, however, is brooding, funny, admittedly narcissistic, and broken - just the way I like my book heroes - and Luke reminds me so much of Lupin (and not just for the obvious reason), and I do love Lupin. 
 What I didn't enjoy was that I felt Clare tried to make the backstory and the history of the Shadowhunters too complex, and parts of it were confusing. I also thought that some of the twists were tired and expected, and the relationships wrapped up too neatly at the end. These are teenagers, after all, teenagers can be flighty, sure, but they also hold grudges and aren't always so quick to forgive. I also wanted more from Alec. It's rare for there to be a LGBTQ character in a series such as this, and I wanted him to have more to do, more to deal with, and I thought it was a cliche for him to take that out on Clary,. 
 But that just points to another of my issues with this, and that's the characterization. Other than Jace and Luke, and perhaps Valentine and Simon, I didn't really feel like I got to know the characters. It wasn't until halfway through that I realized Clary had red hair, and Isabelle and Alec were just kind of there to fill space most of the time. Other characters were in place purely for plot points, and Simon's devotion to Clary didn't really seem to waver, even after she broke his heart and then continued to use him (and the whole Jace-Simon-Clary thing was just laughable and so teenage, ugh). 
 Also, I'm not in love with the whole twist at the end regarding Clary and Jace. It's a bit weird for me, and I know that's the point, but... Jace is more of Han to me than Luke, and this is all a bit too Luke and Leia. And Jace seemed to get over that shocker a bit faster than I would have anticipated, especially since he went all psycho-brainwashed only days before. 
 The plot, once it got going, went, and was a fun read. I like unraveling mysteries when reading, and even though I predicted it, it was still fun to uncover. 
 Even though I didn't love it, I liked it enough that I flew through it in a manner of days (and being almost 500 pages and a super busy week at work, that's impressive for me), and I'm curious enough to continue on with the series and see where the story unfolds."

4,"I kept hearing about Rainbow Rowell, but didn't know she was a Nebraska author. 
 A fun, cute story I read in one night. I think this works well as an epistolatory novel because the writers are newspaper women. I totally buy that they would write in proper English, with quotes and all. Also, only about half the novel is in email format."
5,"It's a joy to see Fitz back at Buckkeep, though he chafes at it and makes excuses and stubbornly drags his heels. Like the first book in the series, this one is about relationships, specifically about how relationships evolve. Fitz sees his relationships with almost everyone he's close to change -- Chade, Dutiful, Hap, the Fool. Wonderfully, Kettricken -- who I could stand to see much more of and who steals every scene she's in -- remains a solid and comforting, if rather absent, stalwart. The glimpses we get of characters long distant (as well as one we're just getting to know) leave the reader emotional and hungry for more. This book in not action packed; it's mostly politics, yet it's never boring or slow. Perhaps it's because I have these on my kindle as one large book, but this series really does tell one long story that just happens to be broken into parts. More than ready for the big finale that is book 3."
3,"I have been anticipating this book for months so I was super excited to get my hands on a galley for an early review. I definitely did not get disappointed. 
 The dystopian setting was great. The world created by Carey is set in a future not too far from now. A deadly virus has wiped out a large part of the population and has resulted in an unhealthy divide between men and women. I would have liked more details on how the society was running, but maybe we don't get to know because basically Eve does not know either. Some parts of it reminded me of ""The Handmaid's Tale"" where there was also a shift in relationships between men and women. And, just like in 'The Handmaid's Tale', in Eve there are also characters who still remember the old days, which makes it even more sad. 
 Eve has spend most of her life at an all-girls school and was taught not to trust men. When she meets Caleb it goes against everything she learned in school. Her naivety made me laugh sometimes, and it was interesting to see Eve struggling between what she learned and what she was experiencing. I did feel that the started to trust Caleb way too soon and it would have been more believable if Eve had kept her distance more. 
 I did like Eve, but sometimes she did things that made me want to scream at her. She is supposed to be intelligent but some of her decisions were just so stupid that it made me mad. 
 I hate overly happy endings, especially in dystopian fiction and this one was just right. It was satisfying but sad at the same time, and it left enough interesting material for the second book in the trilogy. I have still some question marks, but hopefully they will be tackled in the next installment. 
 Although not the best, Eve is a great addition to the YA dystopian titles that are currently out there and will appeal to readers who enjoyed Wither, Birthmarked and Delirium. 
 The original review can be found on my blog: Fragments of Fiction"
3,"YA for grown ups. 
 Involving and thoughtful. Perhaps not a masterpiece but eminently readable and certainly it captures a certain experience of the late twentieth century that I very much related to (as someone who began an undergraduate degree determined to major in Classics and got entirely waylaid by Post-structuralism). At the same time Eugenides does a brilliant job capturing the experience of urgency in your late teens/early twenties and grappling with life's big questions without in any way belittling or trivialising this time. 
 I was a little disappointed in the ultimate trajectory. The way Madeleine is depicted in the penultimate scenes is terribly unflattering and a little unfair. It was telling to me that the epiphanal moment for the characters occurs in a conversation from which Madeleine is excluded. 
 The audio was brilliantly done. The narrator had one of those voices that could bring any character to life and somehow he made all the twenty-somethings distinct and vibrant."
4,Ok.... I LOVED IT.! I thought this was gonna be weird since Gabriel's Inferno wasn't a Paranormal story or had any paranormal on it but this was surprisinly good.. The prince kept me intrigue through the whole book and I can't wait to read what'll happen next.!!!
5,"Soooo the 5 stars go to.....UNFIXABLE!!!! 
 I love Tessa Bailey's books and this one wasn't a let down. I'm happy that Willa's story was told because I adored her in the Protecting What's His novel. 
 I look forward to what Tessa has instored for us :)"
4,"Journalist Mikael Blomkvist has taken a personal and professional hit, one that comes with a three month jail sentence for libeling a financial mogul. As crooked as the untouchable giant is, Blomkvist's passion for justice was no match for the power of money. It was a harsh lesson to learn, and one that put his career and everything he holds dear on the line. 
 Following his conviction and public embarrassment, Blomkvist receives an unexpected request from a man known for being one of Sweden's premiere industrialists. With that call comes an opportunity that will change the course of Blomkvist's life. 
 Forty years ago, a young woman, niece of industry giant Henrik Vanger, disappeared from the mostly family-owned island where she was staying. Once a year every year since that fateful horror, her killer has taunted Henrik with memories of the beloved child, with his failure to protect her, with his failings as both a man and a corporate giant. Forty years Henrik has been haunted by inaction and cold leads. Now in his eighties, he wants answers, and in Blomkvist, he thinks he's found the tool necessary to dig for those answers, whatever they may be. 
 As Blomkvist's and Vagner's lives start to intersect and a family dynasty suffers intense scrutiny, a young girl will be drawn into the hunt. Brilliant and cold, odd and passionless, Lisbeth Salander doesn't have friends so much as she has people she probably wouldn't kill. A savant at information gathering, it is her skill set more than her personality that appeals to Blomkvist. At first. 
 The alliance they form and the attention they put towards a mystery that spans the last century will uncover a rotten core of pretty lies and powerful deceit. Together Blomkvist and the girl with the dragon tattoo will try to solve a case that has baffled police and criminalists for years so they can bring closure to a man in the twilight of his years. The race for the truth will become a cat and mouse game that will threaten their lives and rip apart their souls. Unfortunately, solving that extremely cold case is one thing. Living with the answers...that's quite another. 
 ~*~ 
 I avoided this book for so long, and for fairly predictable reasons. So much hype, and most everyone talking about it like it was the best thing ever written. I know myself well enough to know that those types of books usually don't work for me the same way they seem to for everyone else. 
 To a degree, that was exactly the case with Larsson's incredibly popular debut. I didn't think it was the most incredible book I'd ever read. I did, though, like it. Parts were absolutely awesome, thrilling, suspenseful, intriguing, and completely worthy of every ounce of praise it's received; some parts bored me to tears (like the first 200 pages or so). I wasn't crazy about Blomkvist, who I didn't much like as a man, but respected quite a lot as an investigator and a journalist. I loved Lisbeth Salander intensely. 
 In fact, where the first two hundred or so pages struck me as rather emotionally flat and colorless, including character introductions, so much exposition I would have happily been struck blind as I was wading through it, and a mind-numbing expose on the financial climate in Sweden, every word of every scene with Lisbeth was vibrant...and slightly off-kilter...and excessively colorful. The girl is not normal, but I sorta fell in love with her morally ambiguous and sometimes cruel little heart. 
 She was the sole reason I kept reading...right up until Blomkvist and Vagner meet. From that point on, it felt like I was in another hemisphere reading a completely different book in a totally new language. Maybe I just related more to an uncle's pain and sense of loss, or was captivated more by his extensive and decidedly peculiar family history (sorta like the Adams family meets the Manson family). I know my interest is more piqued by the missing and the dead than capitalist crooks with dollar signs where their hearts should be. 
 And when, finally, Blomkvist and Salander start working together directly...well that's when this book shined its brightest for me. I loved them together. I still didn't much care for Blomkvist as a man, and I think he's got some serious issues with women, but he and Salander just fit together in the story in a way that took me aback, I enjoyed it so much. 
 That's what I'll take from this book that both thrilled me and bored me. That's what I'll remember most. In time, maybe I'll forget the first two hundred or so pages and remember only the last three hundred and fifty or so. I don't consider this the greatest book I've ever read, and I do think there was a ton of superfluous detail that did nothing for the story at all. I liked it, though. Parts I completely loved. And the girl with the dragon tattoo...well, she just totally rocked. 
 ~*~*~*~ 
 Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another."
2,"meh. as far as youth fiction goes, it was okay. the writing was okay, the plot line was okay. what really bugged me though is that lena spent the entire book yelling at ethan and telling him he didn't understand her. and yet, he couldn't live without her? she brought nothing to the relationship table and he couldn't get enough. i've seen this happen too much in real life to be okay with it happening in fiction. i won't be continuing on with this series."
5,"I didn't think I could love a Markus Zusak book more than I already love The Book Thief, but I am the Messenger comes very, very close. 
 Zusak has this amazing way with language. His descriptions, his characters words, all of it is so well chosen and beautiful. It adds to the world of his fiction, bringing it to life and drawing the reader in. 
 And it is very hard not to get drawn into Ed's world. Here is this stalled nineteen year old, thrust into something more as each card arrives and he delivers each message, and the reader sits on the edge of their seat as they go with Ed to each address, to each person. 
 Until the end. 
 And what an end. It isn't every day that the book sums itself up as succinctly and beautifully as I am the Messenger does: 
 (view spoiler)[""I did it because you are the epitome of ordinariness, Ed....And if a guy like you can stand up and do what you did for all those people, well, maybe everyone can. Maybe everyone can live beyond what they're capable of....Maybe even I can."" (hide spoiler)] 
 ""Keep living...It's only the pages that stop here."""
4,"It was nice reading about the English Playboy, Alex, finally settling down with Jessie."
3,"Margaret of Cavendish was an interesting woman who was well ahead of her time. In the 17th century she was writing feminist plays and science fiction, she spoke her mind and eventually became the notorious ""Mad Madge"" who was known for her unusual behavior (wearing a topless ballgown) and respected for it. I knew nothing of her before reading this book and am now far more interested in her actual life. 
 Margaret the First doesn't read like a book that takes place in the 17th century. The prose is easy and it's structured like a series of vignettes. Recommended for an entertaining palate cleanser."
4,"So for those who have read my review on Wool 4 you'll already know that I actually read this one before Wool 4. I got them mixed up on my Kindle and started the wrong one. I would've enjoyed this book so much more if I had realized I was actually reading the end of the series. Since I was reading Wool 5 as actually being #4 I was expecting another book to follow and was so excited to see what happened but was hit hard in the head by a 50 million ton brick when I realized I had just read the end!!!! NOOOOOOOO!!!!! This has been one of the best series ever and I just shot myself in the foot! Oh well, enough complaining, I'll give the best review I can given how upset with myself I am. 
 I thought the way the book ended was brilliant. I have no idea if Hugh is planning on continuing past Wool 5 (minus the prequel)but I hope he is. The end of Wool 5 leaves you feeling happy and hopeful for those who are still around to see the aftermath of Wool 4. The entire environment introduced to us with the next door silo is amazing. I love that Jules comments how everything is exactly same in their silo but it is obviously so glaringly different. One can only guess the devastation that happened there, especially as you get further into the book and realize the history of this abandoned silo. 
 I had absolutely no problem picturing everything that Hugh describes in the book. His explanations are clear and straight forward rather than taking 10 pages to describe something lame and non-essential to the story. 
 I really wouldn't change anything about this series, unless you count that I wish I could go back and read these in order before I knew how it ended. :) 
 Hugh Howey is an amazing author and I am so happy and feel so privileged to have the opportunity to read books during this highly technological era. Wool is a series I probably never would've found any other way except Amazon makes it so much easier for new authors to find their fan base. There are way too many authors that don't properly edit their work and review it before putting it out to the masses. Hugh is not one of these authors. I would happily read anything that he writes and will recommend it till I'm blue in the face to everyone I know. Oh wait...I already do that!"
2,"What was disappointing: 
 1)Boring description on first few paragraphs 
 2)Kiera and Denny being too much of a typical couple in the first few chapters 
 3)Way too much uses of the same verbs (come on, there is only so much laughing, smiling, and blushing a person can act out). The verbs also got me to wonder what was so special about the book. 
 4)Kiera not doing anything, really 
 5)Kellan being too nice to be loved (first few chapters) 
 6)Kiera. Not. Having. Any. Guts. And that's what I hated the most. She would be loved by two men, God knows why, be groped by a pervert, God knows why, be loved by her family and invited home several thousand times, and would never be able to say a thing for herself. She doesn't know how to yell, to shout, to argue. She just freaking stands there and blushes and expects to be loved. 
 7)Extended period of over 450 pages (or so) to get it out to Denny (in the most cliched way, for the record) that Kiera loved someone else. 
 8)Extended period of time, thus, to let readers know that the conflict was resolved and all that reading and reading just couldn't lead anywhere. When I least expected it, the ""issue"" was ""over."" I actually flipped back a couple of pages and thought, ""So... it's done?"" at the scene of the conversation with Denny in the hospital. 
 9)Sort-of disastrous ending. I don't mean it too much, but the three-months-of-separation kind of killed it. At the rate of things happening in the book (day after day of conflict) you would think Kellan and Kiera would be locked away in a bedroom two pages after the hospital scene. 
 That's kind of why I wondered why Thoughtless is so high on Goodreads charts... but I guess I don't like it that much partly because I don't enjoy books based too much on romance. There's only so much patience I could bear. 
 I grudgingly gave this a two-star rating."
3,"I enjoyed some aspects of this book, but I have begun to get a bit frustrated with this series and this book in particular. To be fair the book is written for 'Young Adults' and I am obviously not the target audience. 
 However, having a plot based on the chief character telling the people in charge what they need to know, then constantly being disbelieved, becomes annoying after a while. Also the use of 'good manners' as reason not to act sensibly has been over worked and has now become irritating rather than amusing. 
 This is a conclusion to a four part series, so, as expected there is a lot of action, especially in the last half of the book. This is quite exciting and comes to an admirable conclusion, although again there were several illogical decisions and events (Helium exploding?)."
4,was definitely different from the first story
4,Everything I expected through paradox of choice to be. The only difference is that How We Decide wasn't a disappointment.
5,"I love this book with a deep, burning passion (pun intended). In many ways it's even better than the Goose Girl. I love that we get to see beyond the happily ever after ending, and find out what happens next! 
 Enna is a feisty, strong-willed heroine, which is why I love her so much, but I also love the fact that we get to see her weak side. But she stays strong throughout it all which I think makes her so admirable. 
 I love how this book focuses on Enna and Isi's friendship. They would give anything for the other, even if their life was at stake. And I think that it's beautiful. The way they interact and work together makes me smile. 
 And who could forget about old Finn and Razo? Finn's such a sweetheart. He and Enna are complete opposites, which is why they go together so well. And then Razo is as funny as ever, always there for some comic relief! 
 This book is just so amazing on so many levels. It's something you could read over and over again and never get tired of. It's something you can never forget."
4,"*Review of Audiobook* 
 I actually prefer to hear Alexie read his work; he's an excellent narrator and of course knows just when to emphasize or change tempo for his work to be received as intended. This always boosts his work for me and this collection of shorts was no different! 
 War Dances feels very autobiographical, even if that's outwardly impossible. Every story has a clear part of Alexie in it, from his experiences as a father, a husband, a native, a son, whatever. It's also 100% male-centered, but because it feels like Alexie opening himself up to the reader that doesn't feel lacking. Yet the stories are also varied with each short still managing to fully humanize each character. Some of the writings are too short to evoke much and feel a bit out of place, but they're in the minority. Overall it's an excellent collection about the myriad of ways average people make their way through life's many twists."
3,"More like 3 1/2 for the first half and finishing up with a resounding 4. Definitely an enjoyable, fun, thrill ride of a series! And I am happy to report that Greer made her way into my heart in this one, but Gretchen and Grace remain my fave sisters."
3,"Hover is the sequel to the very promising Gravity, West's fabulous Ya science fiction series. It's a short and fast read, set on the planet Loge after the big showdown on Earth at the end of Gravity. Ari is still completing her change into an Ancient and she has to find a place in the Ancient society. But this is not the paradise, people thought it might be. Because there's still Zeus who follows his own plans which includes the poor humans who've made it to Loge and the whole of humanity which is still on Earth. 
 Ari, being the born leader, doesn't seem to have big problems to be alone an another planet. Sure, she talks about missing her parents and feeling awkward in a new, strange surrounding but as a reader I couldn't feel any real pain or misery. Even though that felt a bit weird, I just accepted it as a sign of her personal strength. Of course, she needs to figure out how to stop Zeus now. But that's not easy as she realizes how big his influence and how powerful his regime on Loge are. 
 The most interesting plotline in the novel is her relationship to Jackson. She thought she knew him on Earth but it's not like he could be himself there. Now on Logan, she not only has to deal with his betrayal of her trust but with his past and a Jackson who is not the person she thought he was. They have to work on their relationship if there's even anything left of it. And I like the slow way, Ari opens her eyes, stops thinking only about her own needs and starts to truly see things. She has a lot of doubts in herself whether she really is as strong as everybody sees her. But that seems ridiculous considering that she's never acted anything but strong so far. 
 All the human characters that were introduced in the first book, play a rather minor one in this sequel. But we're introduced to a few other interesting ones: Emmy the healer and her grandson Vill who is Jackson's (and now Ari's) roommate. 
 But there was one huge disappointment for me in this book. I was so excited to read the sequel because it would take me to another planet! But Loge was completely missing any special alien atmosphere. Yeah, they clothe differently and eat different food. But hey, you can travel to another country to experience that. It didn't feel any different than being on Earth, it was completely missing the atmosphere. I had hoped for much more, sorry. 
 Besides being disappointed, I also kind of got angry towards the ending. This book is so short and in the first 70% next to nothing really happens. And then all out of sudden the big action starts, people start acting, some even against their former beliefs, people trust Ari with so much and there's no explanation whatsoever for this trust. There hasn't been any development up to this moment. And the ending... well don't let me get started. I don't mind cliffhangers, but this ending can't even be called a cliffhanger. It just ends in the middle of the book which is outrageous! 
 The Taking is a great series, combining sci fi elements with the alien trope and a wonderful love story. But it's lacking in so many details that it just can't be as amazing as other series in this genre. It still needs more development, more background, more atmosphere and definitely lots of more pages for that."
3,"This wasn't my favorite Ms. Marvel installment, but it was still pretty solid. 
 The main problem I had with this one was the lack of resolution of the plot - it didn't seem like this issue had a fully fledged arc, but rather something that is leading up to the next one (maybe). It is the end of the world and it seems like that's it. 
 I feel like this one connected this story with other Avengers stories too much and that kind of flew over my head since I'm not up to date with that. I did like the Spider Man issues that were combined into this, they seemed to have some cool story going on other than the thing that caused the Miss Marvel to appear and it also got me interested on the Spider Verse, so maybe I'll be following up with those? 
 Overall, I had fun reading this installment, it was entertaining and I still enjoy Kamala's character and her relationships, but I didn't feel as excited reading this one as I did with the previous Ms. Marvels."
2,"Warning: If you are a fan of this book you may want to avert your eyes. I like to think that I am open minded. I read the first book and.... eh, it was ok. I read this second book and I liked it more than I am willing to admit. 
 This book? 
 Um... 
 With my warning in mind, let's proceed...... 
 ""Her words slam into my libido like a bucket of water on a flame full of testosterone. I think my dick just twitched in protest."" 
 That above quote pretty much sums up this book. 
 Mate, what does that even mean? A flame full of testosterone? What is his dick twitching in protest to? Being hit with a bucket of water? I just.... I just don't know. 
 This book.... 
 This book... 
 This book slammed into my intelligence like a bucket of water on a flame full of intellect. I think my eye just twitched in process. 
 I know I shouldn't complain but I mean come on... I am a complete advocate for reading books that should technically be classed as 'guilty pleasures' even if I don't believe in them. (If something brings you pleasure, why should you feel guilty?) 
 This book did not bring me pleasure, not matter how much this Fuentes brother tried. 
 Let's talk about the characters. 
 Luis Fuentes- come on dowwwwwn. 
 Mate, I don't like you. Seriously, I have a lot of tolerance when it comes to the Fuentes brothers. HEY, I have boobs, it's in my nature. Right? RIGHT? All the girls love the Fuentes. ALL OF THEM. With your washboard abs and your violence and your sexually aggressive tendencies. 
 But you, mi chava, you were so dull and infuriating at the same time. It was like the boring/dull/horrendous parts of Carlos and Alex had been smushed together and we'd been given you. Gah. 
 ""I don't know if it's a good idea to get involved with me right now."" 
 The only time I want a YA boy to say that- is if he is actually a {insert supernatural creature here} who will EAT his lady love. Not an adrenaline junkie gang bangin' poet who can't keep his la tengo duro to himself. 
 Speaking of lady loves... 
 Nikki- come on dooooowwwwn. 
 I wanted to like you, really I did. I relate to you so much. I know exactly what's it like to be broken up with because I'm not Mexican enough. It's awful, isn't it? It's happened to me so many times I've lost count. You'd think it wouldn't bother me now but you're wrong. It's rough, yeah? 
 You taught me a lot though, darling Nikki, because now I know as long as I have a bicep to cling onto, I'll be reet and I'll be able to face the world with my head held high and.... what not. 
 Also, was it just me or did the italicised Espanol get ridiculous? I have no idea what half of this book said. Oh and every time someone says 'andale' to me, I get this song in my head. 
 This book made no sense. The characters and story lines were just flung together in the way I imagine the ingredients would be if I were to ever make enchiladas. 
 I have so many questions. 
 Why was Luis in a gang? 
 Why did Nikki hate boys so much and then kiss them in pool houses? 
 Or... OK, fair enough.... A bit of a distrust but why did she think that Luis was going to be the same as Marco? Not every Mexican boy is the sa- 
 Wait.... Just got a call from Latino Boys In YA Official Group of Gangbanging and Officialness and I've been informed that yes, every Mexican boy is the same as Marco and they are all affiliated with a gang and they all take drugs and gangbang each other (did I use that right?) and shoot people and fall for rich girls who they see as a 'challenge'. 
 I have more questions but I get too angry to ask them. 
 In a sentence- I wanted this book to be about a shy Latino boy with two badass gangbangin' brothers who meets a sassy Mexican gal who is all sassy and.... um.. sassy. 
 In a paragraph- I wanted this book to be about a shy Latino boy with two badass gangbangin' brothers who meets a sassy Mexican gal who is all sassy and....um.... sassy. I would love to have seen Nikki completely sass him (is that a thing?) and have had a Fuentes brother who didn't know what to do with a full-blooded mamacita. Instead I got a book with two unlikeable characters that I didn't understand, a completely unfeasible plot (tell me again why Luis is in a gang?), angst thrown in for no apparent reason (HEY MARCO!) and scabby dogs. Oh and character assassinations of people that I loved. Carlos... crying? You're having a giraffe, right? 
 I have no more words so I'm going to post random snippets of the commentary my fellow readalongers and I created. They aren't in any order and they don't make sense... kind of like this book. 
 I'm keeping this bit anonymous so we can play a game of Pin the Snark on the Reviewer. Out of Reynje, Flann, Trin and I.... Who said what? 
 SPOILERS. 
 I would vomit on someone if they proposed to me like that. 
 She sounds like she lets her PANTIES drop for any Mexican around 
 If I was Kiara, I would kick Carlos in the face while he's down on one knee. 
 I'm just skimming for biceps now. 
 This hey, hey business is the worst EVERYTHING IS THE WORST! 
 **** this ****ing book. 
 Because all gangbangers are awesome at sex and not one of them ever was not anything less than a facepunch of sex-awesome, according to Elkeles. 
 I couldn't stop laughing thinking about driving over there and just picking up a Mexican guy for sex. 
 I always think of other boys when I'm in bed with a gangbanger. 
 I just can't stop straddling things. It's a real problem. 
 WHEN HE LOOKS AT ME I ALMOST BREATH! This is so tense you guys! 
 I hate it when my boyfriend's beautiful mesmerising eyes pierce my soul. 
 If someone got gangbanged, I'd think they were in a porn video rather than in the hood. The way the Elkmeister uses it is such a secondary meaning for everyone. And it makes me chuckle every.damn.time.. 
 May the gangbangers ever be in your favour. 
 As much as this review is full of snark and negativity, I want to reiterate something: I finished this book. Yep, I finished this book. Thus the power of Ms Elkeles, she will always get the last laugh. 
 And it seems I am, and always will be, a sucker for gangbangers. 
 That sounds so wrong to my fragile English brain I can't even deal with it. 
 You can read this review and lots of other exciting things on my blog, Wear the Old Coat."
1,"Thank God it is OVER. I thought it would never end. I read it on the recommendation of a friend who said she couldn't put it down. She neglected to explain that she couldn't put it down because it NEVER ENDED. And since it never captured my interest, never ending is not a good thing."
3,"I didn't read Prom Night From Hell and didn't know this was a continuation of Kim Harrison's short story until I read some other reviews. It did feel, though, like it was the second book or so in the series sometimes- the way the character's internal thoughts recapped events prior to that book's start. 
 The book was kind of shallow for most of its very short 232 pages. The girl is dead but there isn't much more than a surface feeling from her. There is plenty of drama, angst and inner turmoil she could be feeling but all she feels is bad for lying to her dad and sad that he was sad when he thought she was dead. 
 It was also kind of irritating to get the whole ""I'm different because I shop at Hot Topic and you're popular because you shop at The Gap"" thing. It was not nearly as bad as the mallgoth cliche of Vampire Kisses, but it was still noticeable. 
 This book actually wasn't very interesting until Nakita came back. After that it picked up and that's the only reason this got 3 stars. I'm hoping next one is better, but I think I'd have to read some of it before I bought it. I don't like buying hardcovers that are so short."

 The Help is set in 1962-1964 in Jackson, Mississippi and focuses on the lives of Southern women -- the black maids who work in middle and upper class homes and the white women who employ them. The setting of Jackson is during the early stirrings of civil rights, but after Rosa Parks made it possible to sit anywhere on the bus. The story is told from the point of view of three women, Aibaleen and Minny, two maids, and Skeeter, a college-educated journalist who thinks that the traditional attitudes about segregation need to change. The three women come from very different backgrounds and ages, but their lives intertwine around the project spear-headed by Skeeter, to write a book telling the story of what maids go through -- the good and the bad. In particular, the story focuses on Aibaleen's trying to raise her employer's little girl to be less racist and to be more confident in herself, on Minny's trials as an opinionated woman whose mouth often gets her fired, and on Skeeter's rejection by her former friends for even thinking about desegregation. There are other sidelines in the stories of Hilly, the most racist and superior of friends, Elizabeth, the friend who can't quite leave Hilly's orbit, Celia, the white ""trash"" beauty who just can't get anyone in Hilly's crowd to call her back or embrace her socially, and the other maids who first refuse to share their stories and then whole-heartedly embrace it after Hilly arranges for her maid to have a all-too-speedy trial over the theft of a cheap garnet ring. 
 I believe that the characters of Minny, Aibie, and Skeeter are well-developed, believable characters who come together in unlikely circumstances. It might seem unbelievable at first, but someone had to be first to cross the race barrier; otherwise, we would still have some form of segregation. I think overall it is Aibie who is the most memorable and believable and who really illustrates the struggle and dilemma of black women of that time. She puts up with much from Hilly and just bites her tongue -- but would doing otherwise have benefitted her? As we see, Minny loses her job and can't get another, and another maid goes to jail for a relatively minor theft. Hilly even manages to frame Aibie for the theft of her silverware...thankfully, Elizabeth decides not to press charges. This shows the precarious nature of the jobs of these maids and why so few of them spoke up. However, the danger of their meeting with Skeeter so regularly is somewhat hard to believe.....I applaud what they do, but I wonder if they really would have been able to meet so often without many noticing Skeeter there. Overall, though the character of Aibie is an inspiration. 
 I also feel strongly about Minny and her struggles with her abusive husband and her concern for her children and her pride and unwillingness to take so much abuse from her employers. I think that her circumstances working for Celia are a bit unrealistic, but adds a sense of comic relief at points and shows that the rigidity of the southern white social structure also excluded white trash. I think though that the main point of Celia is to show that not all women then were so rigid in the segregation. Celia insists on eating with Minny at the same table, and the women each save the others life at some point. (Celia saves Minny from the crazed naked white man, and Minny saves Celia from hemmorhaging after her fourth miscarriage.) The final satisfaction of having Celia's husband appreciate and thank Minny is the ultimate pleasure in a book otherwise showing mostly ungrateful employers. Also I am sure am glad Minny finally left Leroy after that final showdown and beating. Enough is enough. 
 I have less to say really about Skeeter, though she is the impetus for all the interviews to even happen. She writes, she submits, and she publishes the book under anonymous. Her mother wants her to marry, and she does fall twice for Stuart, but ultimately has to lose him instead of giving up her ideals. I like Skeeter, and I think her great love for Constantine is a real plus in the plot and her character's development. I think she really endures a lot by losing her childhood friends, the respect of all the Women's League members, and Stuart. At the same time, she gains the great friendship of Aibie and also of Minny. She finally is able to let go of home and go to follow her dream job. Most of all, she accomplishes an almost impossible task of getting the black maids to share their stories and getting so many people to actually read about it. Also I think she helps in some way to transform her mother from a ""I need my daughter to get married at any cost"" to a woman who has some resilience and appreciation for her daughter after all. Personality-wise, I think Skeeter is really the least developed of the three main characters. 
 Overall, I must say that this book still has me thinking about the times of segregation and the ultimate unfairness of it. I see Hilly, who seems to have few redeeming qualities aside from the great love for her children, to be the personification of this racist attitude and the idea of separate but equal thinking. Her drive to set up separate bathrooms for the help is the central point of what makes Skeeter perhaps so wanting to change things. It is Hilly who makes Aibie feel shame over having her own bathroom built in the garage, and it is Hilly who is the nemesis of both Minny and Celia. So despite her rather shallow and ""evil"" qualities, I think putting a human quality on Hilly would not serve any good purpose. Elizabeth in some ways is even less developed and has virtually no thoughts outside of Hilly's thoughts -- that seems to be the point... What I don't understand is how Hilly could become the leader of the Women's League when she is so young, has been married only a few years, and is a young mother. I would have thought in reality that the older women would have more of a role in a group like this. However, without this role as president, Hilly would not have the power and the ""pulpit"" and the influence to get both Minny and Skeeter rejected like they are. All coming back to the unfairness of segregation. 
 I'll end here with this thought -- if you have to choose only one book to read, choose THE HELP. You will have a new understanding of why civil rights was so needed and why MLK gave his life to see it happen."

4,"I adore Matt and Evan, and loved this glimpse of where they and the family were, a couple of years down the road. I liked the fact that not all the kids were perfect, or necessarily settled into the new family life, and that the issues weren't always the obvious ones. And I love Matt even more now. I heard there may be more short stories or novellas about these two down the road, and will happily read any of them."

 T H O U G H T S: 
 the assassin's curse is a journey book, slow and underdeveloped. it had many issues, but the worst was its lack of world-building. it's a novel with such scope, that takes us through seas and swamps and deserts and towns, but it tells us close to nothing about its magic system, its culture, its laws, its geography, the pirates and their customs. with no emotional depth, no dimensional characterization, and no plot, the assassin's curse didn't work for me.

5,"Most of the book was focused on her point of view, I would've liked to read more about his POW because the only hint we got to him liking her is the mood swings? sure there were other hints, but we didn't get to see how he felt during the last part of the book (after she disappeared we only got that he was angry and disappointed, therefore mood swings)"
5,"This was just as astounding to read as it was to listen to--no small feat with the talent recruited for the audiobook. On the page, Saunders' achievement is even more obviously impressive. With the scope of his imagination, he is able to convey the multiple viewpoints of almost any situation. In this version, I paid more attention to the ""original source"" documents that frame each chapter: supposedly first-hand accounts from eye witnesses and newspaper excerpts. What comes across in reading them is how self-interested, biased, often flatly contradictory these sources are. In the shifting viewpoints he gives us, even the color of Abraham Lincoln's eyes is disputable. Taken together with the panoply of voices that narrate the events that take place in the ""bardo,"" the end result is an awareness of how much we shape and construct our own reality, and how little is objectively true. With each raconteur, their character and temperament is revealed more clearly than any actual event they relate. Saunders seems alive to the charm, poverty of understanding, beauty, silliness, or grim horror accordingly and gives each its due with an empathy that embraces all."

 3.5 CAPTURED and TAKEN STARS. 
 This was a very interesting read! It was very hard to put down. I was supposed to read this to put me back to sleep, but I can't put it down. 
 The problem is I have to suspend belief while reading this. (view spoiler)[When Doug and Mat was captured, I thought why are those thugs damaging on their merchandise? It's so dumb. Maybe they're just really horny. (hide spoiler)] 
 And even with all the brutality that happened in the book, it was not as disturbing as the others I read that I cringed. 
 But overall, this is a good read. And I'm eager to read the next episode!"
5,"Such an adorable book. It had me smiling all the time. It was so sweet and pure and honest... I didn't exactly know what to expect when I started reading it, but the experience turned out to be wonderful. The characters were great as well, even the parents, which started in a rather complicated place, but turned out to be quite endearing. I'm willing to bet this was one of the happiest readings I'm going to be counting this year. It was lovely."
3,"So, this was the first book by his author that I've read and, for the most part, it was really good. 
 As you must have gathered from reading the blurb and/or some reviews, this is the story of Tally and Lex. Tally used to be super popular in high-school, due to being the mayor's son; he was also the leader of a group of boys who ruled their town and picked on the weakest. One of the people they used to bully is Lax, who used to be an overweight, nerdy kind of kid who came from a poor family, so he really didn't have anyone resourceful or influential to turn to about being bullied. 
 At the time this story starts, though, more than a decade has passed and the table has turned. After some scandal involving his father, Tally left town with his mother and was never seen again. Soon after that his mother dumped him too, after finding out that he is gay. Now, after passing through some tough situations, Tally is finally broke and had to put his tail between his lags and go back home to the city where everyone hates him because of the bad attitude he used to have when he thought he ruled town, since there is where his grandmother, the only person he had to turn to, still lives. 
 Lex, on his turn, is nothing even close to what he used to be as a kid. He is a successful entrepreneur, owning the best coffee place in town; he is also charismatic, somewhat popular and handsome too. 
 When Tally arrives in town no one wants to give him a job due to his bad reputation. He then sets out to find a place where he is sure no one knows him, so that he'd have better chances of actually landing a job. He then sees Lex's coffee's hiring, so he goes there. The instant they meet, Tally is immediately attracted to the handsome man Lex's become and, since he knows that he has good looks too, he can't understand why Lex treats him, initially, so curtly and even rudely. The tricky thing is, Lax didn't use to go by such name when they were in school, so Tally has no idea that the only person that's about to give him a job, a person that he is attracted to, is the little boy he used to bully more than a decade ago. 
 I absolutely love this premise! It's always so intense when, in this kind of books, supposed enemies get face to face with each other after years... So yeah, I loved how their relationship was developed. Initially, Lax made Tally pay a little for being such an asshole when they were younger. But then, as the weeks passed and Lex got to see that Tally had genuinely changed, they started to become friends. A little more than friends, actually. 
 So yeah, when things started to warm up between Tally and Lex, I though I'd be in for a treat; a beautiful romance full of sexual tension and intensity and everything that I like about enemies to lovers stories. And, to a certain extent, I got all those things. Tally and Lex were super charismatic characters and super sweet together. Plus, they really talked; there wasn't any of that lack of communication bullshit here. Also, the secondary characters were all really believable and fun too, even the ones who were a pain in the ass. 
 So, what made me give this book a three star rating instead of a five star rating? Well, not to sound offensive or anything, but I did feel like the writing itself lacked emotion. For instance, I felt like didn't have a consistent pace; like it had the right elements in the right order, but it was moving too fast sometimes. I couldn't help but feel that everything seemed too convenient, sometimes. One dialogue would instantly jump to the most obvious conclusion and then the next scene would be the perfect thing with the perfect quick dialogue again. It just didn't feel real enough for me, half of the time. 
 I'm not saying, in any way, that there wasn't character development. There was. But it was way more descriptive and raw than what I'm used to in romances like this. I didn't feel like the author focused enough on what the characters were feeling regarding the situations and changes they were going through. Instead, it was like she focused more in explaining the processes logically. It's hard to explain. You'll have to read for yourself and see if you can understand what I'm talking about. Maybe it's not even there and it's all just my stupid brain fucking things up. 
 Overall, though, it was a pretty nice story. The characters were solid and I had some laughs as well. It was a cute story that spoke of forgiveness, acceptance, persistence and, finally, love. It was a little angsty here and there, but I didn't mind. Actually, since I didn't find it emotional enough, the angst made me happy since I was finally feeling something while reading the story. I'm curious to see if other works from this author are the same when it comes to emotions, so I'll probably be reading some more of her books in the near future. 
 Anyway, that's it for this one. Peace!"
3,I was disappointed.
1,"I didn't like this book. 
 Why? 
 A whiny jackass narrator spends half his time raging against a psychopathic punch card Freud machine during ""therapy sessions"". 
 The story is supposedly about a great trauma that happened to the main character, Rob, when he went off to a space station to go take prospecting trips on alien ships and hopefully make it rich. 
 Except I don't think anything really horrible happened to him, he turned out to be an absolute coward, and he inflicted more pain on those around him than he got in return. 
 He beat up his on-again off-again ""girlfriend"" because she slept with another man right after he had slept with another woman. HE BEAT A WOMAN UP. And then you just get the sense that he considers himself the victim of the whole thing, of his whole life, of other people's choices. 
 It also had some seriously effed up psychological concepts in it (primal screaming? Being forced to yell out euphemisms for oral sex during your therapy sessions? I think I am actually too young to know if this was considered a real medical treatment). 
 Bottom line for me: the main character you're supposed to sympathize with is a casual playboy mysognist. 
 I don't think I ever want to read another book by Pohl. Man Plus was really flawed, and Gateway just made me mad."

 Madison Decater lived two parallel lives. She was in love with two men who knew the existence of each other and it worked for all three of them. 
 Steward Brand was wealthy venture capitalist who could give her everything but his time. Paul Linx was a professional surfer who would do anything for her. Everything was fine as long as their lives are kept separated. But the unconventional relationship was on the verge of breaking down when unexpected circumstance wedged itself in between. 
 What attracted me to this book was the premise of an open relationship triangle where all parties agreed upon such bond. It was interesting to see how each of them accepted it as part of their lives. 
 Can I go there? Can I bring these two worlds so close and still escape with our twin relationships intact? 
 I liked Madison. I didn't think she was a slut for being in this relationship. Their situation was unique and I really couldn't judge her on that. And I really couldn't blame her for falling in love with both of the men because they were complete opposite that complimented each other. 
 He worried about me. My safety, my happiness. Worried about losing me due to lack of attention. 
 Stewart was the alpha who controlled every aspect of his life with a precision. His knew where his priority lay and never wavered from it. Even thought he was the more clinical one in the relationship, his love for her wasn't necessarily less than the other man. 
 While Stewart wants me to have a second man to keep me off the streets, to keep me from being lonely, to keep me in his life - Paul accepts that I have a second man because it was what he signed up for. 
 I loved Paul from the get go. He was kind, fun and carefree. It was hard for me not to fall for his easy going outlook in life. He was also unselfish with both his time and love. 
 I love the twist in the story. I did not see that one coming and it made their relationship that much more messed up. 
 One of the best scenes in the book was definitely the business dinner scene. I love how each of them used each other in that moment. It was damn hot! 
 Overall, I loved the story, but I would prefer if the ending was slightly different.

 Return by Aaron Becker is the third installment in the Journey Trilogy. 
 As the little girl's father is once again occupied, she decides it's time for another adventure into an exotic world. This time, she has an unexpected visitor. 
 What made this book different from the first two was that this time the reader gets a glimpse into the real emotions the little girl has from not getting enough attention from her parents. I like the way this is incorporated and the ending sends a powerful message. 
 We loved it. I'm really looking forward to more from this author.

5,"This book has always been one of my favourites after reading it a few years ago, but when I got my own copy, I couldn't wait to re-read it. Immediately, I feel pulled towards Charlie's character, he is lovable and gentle and just, ugh, how could you not love him. Throughout this story, my heart was breaking for him on various occasions. As much as I love the film, and I do love the film, it upsets me the little details that they miss. I wish the scene before Charlie is in the hospital was more complex/detailed like it is in the film but I love love love this book anyway!"

 Ohh, swoon. Wow. Colton was like a teddy bear, a really hot one. Actually, that image doesn't seem very attractive right now, but Colton is a bad boy, or thinks he is. Really, he's this bighearted, loving and swoonworthy guy. I'm confused as to why to model on the cover for him doesn't have tattoos. Maybe it's on his other arm? 
 So, Cheyenne and Colton start a 'charade' of being in a relationship to get back at her boyfriend, Greg, who Cheyenne caught cheating on her. At first, the game is all fun and playful, and they have 'casual' sex and banter a lot. But they learn secrets about each other and open up each other's soul. I know that's a corny way to put it, but that's how I see it, and it's done in a totally charming and endearing way. Cheyenne and Colt are both dealing with problems, both having to do with their mother. So, I loved watching them connect on that level, and then so many more as they got to know each other. 
 There are some somber and serious scenes in here, so this wasn't an all happy and fun read. It read quickly, though, but the ending has a too sweet epilogue."
5,This book broke me and put me back together. Just when I think everything is smooth sailing I'm hit with a hurricane. This book is heartbreakingly wonderful and deep and everyone should read this book. The emotional roller coaster was felt throughout the entirety of the novel and will stay with me.
3,Not a bad romance. A little long and the denial of feelings got a bit old after a while. Definitely can be read as a stand alone.
3,"As far as this series goes, it wasn't the best book but if I'm honest, I wasn't that impressed with the direction the previous book (Passion) took us in either but I wanted to finish the series and it was on my shelf so I finally read it. It only took me a day and it wasn't a terrible read. Some of the aspects made me roll my eyes and others disappointed me but one of the strength was characters. Though Daniel bored me as usual, I loved the Outcasts and the new addition of Dee was a pretty fun one as well. The other angels were interesting as always and the few scenes Cam had made me love him all the more. 
 The ending didn't feel completely right but it was the only way the series could really go. I just feel that maybe it had more potential in the earlier books then the way it turned out. However I wouldn't say don't read it, give the whole series a go."
3,"The most memorable part of this story is Nathan's honor and integrity when most men in his circumstances would have given up, that and his really fine ride the sleek sexy ""Black Death"". 
 BAD series is pretty light reading for me, this book was par for the course."
5,"Santa brought me this for Christmas & I've been sitting on it for a while, but I see other people started reviewing, so let the floodgates open. 
 Edited to add: I'm going to pepper this review with spoiler cuts. I don't feel it's particularly spoiler-y, and I don't mention specific events, but I give a pretty clear indication of what to expect from the book. Since I don't want to inadvertently ruin anything for anyone, I'll use the spoiler cuts, but I'll do them individually so you can decide what you might want to spoil yourself on, if anything. 
 I've read this thing about seven times already. It picks up very soon after the events of Written in Red so you must must must have read Written and it should be fairly fresh in your mind. (view spoiler)[ While Written was very rich with the world-building and the character-development, Murder of Crows is plot-driven. Bishop shifts the focus to the human/Others tension and the plight of the Blood Prophets. We also go beyond the Courtyard and learn more about the geo-political structure of Namid. I believe some of it will influence the third book, but Bishop weaves the information in naturally and doesn't info-dump. (hide spoiler)] 
 The relationship between Meg and Simon (view spoiler)[ also starts to gain stronger romantic overtones, but Bishop is letting it grow slowly and naturally. It's executed very realistically as these characters see (and experience) the world very differently, but are drawn together. I loved how befuddled Simon was. He understands (due to her sheltered innocence, it takes Meg longer to get it) what's happening between them and he's not really sure he likes it. Simon finds himself adapting his life and behaviors for Meg and it's not a comfortable situation or feeling for him. Meg, on the other hand, has to figure out how she feels about Simon while also figuring out who she is. From a psychological standpoint, I loved how Bishop handled it. (hide spoiler)] 
 My only complaint is (view spoiler)[that we didn't get enough Sam. I adored him in Written in Red, but he's a background character in Murder of Crows. To be honest, though, I'm not sure how Bishop could have really worked him in more. It would've mucked up the flow/pacing of the overall book. (hide spoiler)] 
 As far as the genre/tone go, this is still not a strictly comfortable book. The Courtyard, via their exposure to Meg, are willing to adapt their thinking about humans, but there's still very much a predator/prey vibe. (view spoiler)[There is people-eating. Not a lot, but it's there. (hide spoiler)] Also, because we (view spoiler)[learn more about Blood Prophets and their captivity/slavery (hide spoiler)], if you have any triggers about violence towards women, this may not be the book for you. While I was horrified at times, it's what the book wanted me to feel. Nothing is gratuitous, in my opinion, but it's there. Know what you're getting into. 
 If you enjoyed Written in Red (my pick for best book of 2013), I think you'll also adore Murder of Crows."
3,"It was very entrancing, the way this book trapped you into its magical world. I loved all of it, the characters, the plot, the dark theme and the romances of course. Definitely loved another one of Rosamund Hodge's spellbinding tales."
5,"I can't tell you how many times I read these books. 
 The author did a brilliant job at the most important aspect of a good story: her protagonist is utterly, completely relatable. I understood every single one of Anne's struggles and decisions. I soared with her, wept with her, grew up with her. 
 Especially for young women who have trouble fitting in, this book is a real delight. 
 Favorite quotes: 
 ""Yes, and well I know it,"" admitted Anne mournfully. ""But have you ever noticed one encouraging thing about me, Marilla? I never make the same mistake twice."" 
 ""I don't know as that's much benefit when you're always making new ones."" 
 ""Oh, don't you see, Marilla? There must be a limit to the mistakes one person can make, and when I get to the end of them, then I'll be through with them. That's a very comforting thought."" 
 Words to live by."

 First of all if you're in one of those content challenges, this would run the gamut. Literally, it would fit in anywhere. You need a death? Here. (That's not a spoiler, there are multiple deaths. Not saying who dies) You need Enemy? Here. You need Alpha, Dominant, Tatted, Pierced? You need Organized Crime, Revenge, On the Run, 2nd Chance, Older Younger, Dark themes Here. Lots of suspense & action, HERE! 
 There is no Paranormal or Historical & That's about it! I could not make up my mind. 
 Truthfully it kept my interest but there was too many moving parts in my opinion. There were times I was back & forth a bit. I was just trying to keep things straight in my head. 
 But by the time the author wrapped everything up, I was pleasantly impressed. I didn't love it, but I did end up liking it!

 I'm definitely interested in next book of Ruby & Neco! That one will be Friends to Lovers! Wonder what all she's gonna throw at that one?? 
 I graciously received a free copy of this book through NetGalley and voluntarily chose to post a review."

4,"Audio books you need to download now 
 This beast of an audio book tops out at about 34 hours and is for fantasy and Game of Thrones fans. Season four kicks off on April 6 (look for an HEA post next week about it), and this is the perfect time for fans to download A Song of Ice and Fire. Roy Dotrice is amazing and is definitely a great narrator. 
 There are some issues with the pronunciation of names after a while ... but let's be honest, Martin has written a million characters into this series, and it's hard for me as a reader and listener to keep up with them all. 
 If you are trying to get a Weekend Warrior badge, this is the perfect book to take you there!

 Wow Cathy is a scumbag. Also apparently Andrews thinks all men are pedophile rapists. 
 The ending was frustratingly stupid (Cathy finds herself preparing the attic of her house and buys a picnic basket like the one her grandma had) but the book was entertaining enough, in a soap-opera trainwreck kinda way. 
 Probably the highlight of the book is that at one point, Cathy is hoarding food, as a reaction to being starved in the past. It was an interesting example of her PTSD."
4,"Wow. What a book. Definite flaws in this book, the biggest one being that it was just so unbelievably unrealistic. That being said, at some point during the first half of the book, I just shrugged my shoulders, went with it, and by not taking the book too seriously afterwards, was able to enjoy it immensely! 
 Fiona Finnegan is a seventeen year old living in a small village in London. Her family, although quite poor, all love each other, and pull together to make ends meet, and live a happy enough life. 
 Encouraged by her father to think big, and follow her dreams, Fiona is not satisfied with her life, working all day in a tea factory, and having to come home and help her mother. She dreams of owning her own shop someday, (seems small, but back in the day, it was a bit of a pipe-dream for young ladies, I'm sure!) 
 She, and her love Joe, are saving up penny by penny to be able to make that dream a reality. Joe, who has lived with his family just down the street their whole lives, also dreams big for himself. Frustrated by the lack of enthusiasm met by his father, who is of the mentality of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it,"" forces Joe to accept a job offer from an up and coming business man, who himself started from humble beginnings; perhaps he sees a lot of himself in Joe, and he is keen to learn from a master of the trade, so as to make something of himself someday. 
 Right from the get go, Fiona and Joe are tested in their love for one another, and their ambition to make something of themselves. 
 Start the series of unfortunate events: at first the tragedies seem pretty possible; Fiona's father is hurt on the job, his injuries being so severe that he doesn't survive from them, forcing Fiona to take a second job to try and pick up the slack from the lost wages. Then, (view spoiler)[ Joe cheats on her, impregnates another woman, and marries her. Her mother is murdered, followed by her baby sister, and then her older brother, who has apparently committed suicide? THEN she overhears a plot that caused her fathers murder, comes across five hundred pounds, runs away with her only remaining younger brother, finds a ship to America, but oh no! You need a reservation to get on this boat??? Oh phew! A rich gentleman who just happens to have a double reservation even though he is traveling alone will take them in, and pretend to be her husband! (hide spoiler)] 
 Ok, that is the end of Part One. At this point like I said previously, I just had to laugh and go with it. Normally, I wouldn't stand for this type of book. But there was something so interesting about the characters and this story, that I had to just keep reading. 
 I think the main thing, is that the side characters are just way to endearing for me to give up this story. When we meet Nicholas, you cannot help but just love him. His kind spirit, and his love for Fiona. And Michael was such a laugh, even though he was pretty frustrating. You can't help but cheer on Fiona as she strives for her life goals despite her never ending hardships. (Like seriously, we get it; she is from unfortunate circumstances, but she is a strong female who will not give up. For God's sake - WE GET IT!!!) 
 I enjoyed the back and forth storyline of Fiona and Joe as they try and live the lives they've been set, all the while just missing each other by moments. It's a good Romeo and Juliette tale for sure. 
 This book was a tad bit too long though. I knew where the author was trying to take us, but there were parts where I wished she had written more about, characters I wish she had written less. If she was really going for the amount of drama she seemed to be writing about, I really think she should have kept Millie around for a bit longer - oh yes, how I loved reading Millie's chapters at the beginning! I don't normally warm to such people, but there was just something about her I really liked. Probably because Fiona was such a brat at the beginning... 
 All in all, a great read if you can just read it for what it is, and not get too wrapped up in all the unrealistic events. It has everything a reader could want: suspense, murder and mystery. Romance and humour. There is something for everyone. A solid four stars!"

 Hope was a dangerous, disquieting thing, but he thought perhaps he liked it. 
 I have no idea how to rate this because I'm not even sure I understood everything that was going on??? 
 I really loved the beginning, but as the story progressed I started getting confused about pretty much half of what was going on. Maybe because this book and the characters were so twisted. Who knows? 
 So before I talk about all the things that bugged me, here's what I liked: 
 - Neil. 
 - This was a character driven story. 
 - All characters, even the minor ones, were developed. 
 - There was no romance! 
 Now to what bothered me: 
 - There was a lot of sports talk that I did not care about about a fictional sport that I did not understand. 
 - I have no idea how old these characters are supposed to be, either (maybe teenagers, I think? I don't know). 
 - I knew about Neil's past because of the synopsis, but when the full story was revealed it just came across as something so so dramatic and tragic and out of touch with everything, I just. I don't even know??? 
 - Same thing about Kevin's past. 
 - Andrew (view spoiler)[and the drugs and the knives and even more drugs. (hide spoiler)]. People compare Andrew to Ronan Lynch and I just???????? Don't see it at all. 
 And one thing I absolutely hated with everything that I am: 
 - (view spoiler)[Andrew, Kevin, Aaron, and Nicky draged Neil to a club and drugged him. The purpose of this was so Andrew could get information from Neil. And while Neil was drugged Nicky kissed him twice, obviously without his consent. (hide spoiler)] 
 But for some reason after all of that I still want to read the next installment. I guess I want to see where this trainwreck ends.

2,"I really wanted to like this book, but frankly, I didn't. I actually chuckled a few times during the introduction, but then I couldn't get through the next few chapters. When the author describes aspects of her childhood, I found that it was less than interesting or remarkable. It certainly was not very funny. It was sort of like being forced to watch old home movies of a family that you don't know very well and waiting for an excuse to escape. With a book, I don't believe I need an excuse to escape. I just stopped reading."

 DREAM CAST!! 
 know its terribly cliche to begin a review with a sobbing picture or rants about sobbing but.... 
 My heart is bleeding! 
 This book is beautifully devastating. 
 Sometimes I feel like killing the author Jojo Moyes for doing this to me. 
 This is one book that I could read a million times but still feel torn and heart broken. 
 In fact I think I should stop writing this review now because no matter what I write I can never do this book any justice. 
 This is one of those books that just pulls you in, slowly mesmerizing you, making you break into smiles every few seconds and makes you grow such a bond with the characters you didn't think possible! 
 The story: Lou is a 20 something girl who is satisfied with her life. She does not really yearn to live fully and crazily. While Will would kill to be able to just have the option and the choice of doing so much with his life. 
 As it happens Lou begins working for will! 
 And in all that time, Lou learns how to live, how to be full spirited while trying to remind a man that life is worth living. With several twists and heart wrenching scenes in this book, Jojo Moyes completely makes you fall in love with Will, the arse, and Lou the girl with the striped legs. 
 Their journey in this been written in this astoundingly real way and not made it feel like make believe. There are no magical coincidences and there is a lot of sarcasm and normalness. 
 There are various truths and understandings along the journeys and some terrible and truths and then finally those twists that twist your heart. This book tells us to live a little bolder and never settle for less because it may be taken away from you any time. This book also tells that sometimes things don't go like you think they will and that change and taking risks are very frightening but very needed as well. Out there is a world waiting for you to open it and take all what you want from it. 
 This story was written in an amazing way with the perfect plot to connect with you. When this book surprises you, it feels like those times when you feel as if life has slapped you on the face and it stings. Perfect in every way. 
 As for the ending, I don't know if I would have changed the ending. Probably not. As much as I want what happened not to have happened, the ending was perfect and made me sob my lungs out. This is actually my second time reading this book. I STILL CANT GET OVER IT. 
 What makes this book even more amazing are those little moments. In Alicia's wedding the dance between will and Lou, the storm night in Mauritius, Lou's birthday party, the various concerts they attend, the foreign films will makes Lou watch. 
 This is a beautiful book and I suggest every one that read it once in your life even the guys out there. I mean it, there's soo much more to this book than falling in love. There's the bitter truth and all that. 
 On an ending note I should probably warn you that this book gives out dangerous emotions and guarantees outbursts and depression periods. Totally worth it though! 
 Lots of love & chocolate marshmallow pizza 
 Beez. 
 As usual, this is just another one of the books that Beez forced me to read and I'm glad she did. This isn't your typical romance novel, even though the beginning may fool you into thinking so. I don't really know what genre to put it in since it has almost everything except for supernatural and fantasy stuff. 
 Me before You was released last year and everyone knows that Twilight was all the rage at the time. This book went unnoticed among almost everyone. Why? Because the publishing market was craving for more vamps and werewolves. But thank the lord that this book was published. If such a book remained as a draft then it would be a crime. A crime towards all the people who cherish a beautiful, heart-touching book. 
 The story might sound confusing but I think that's what makes this book something you can relate to. Since life is one huge pile of schist. 
 Louisa was a really happy and satisfied woman. She had the best job, a hot/rich boyfriend, a small house with her bedroom (or closet) being the smallest, financial problems, a younger sister, Katrina who is always smarter than her, an old grandfather who is just a burden... okay so maybe I should cut off the ""Happy"" part about her life. 
 And I should probably mention that unlike any other ""normal"" individual she has no desire what so ever to explore the world around her, to gain fame or whatever. She just wants to work since she loses her great job at a tea shop. She wants to support her family again because she was the only one who was working. 
 After going through the options of working at a chicken fast food restaurant and working as a stripper she finally decides to try for the job of taking care of a quadriplegic, even though she was afraid that she would have to wipe butts. 
 She ends up getting the job and all she has to do is keep Will happy. Easy right? Wrong. 
 Will has lived every moment of his life to the fullest until his accident. He doesn't regret anything he ever did but he was a man who wanted to live more and here comes along a woman who is actually satisfied with her boring, imperfect life and is responsible for giving him a reason to live. 
 On one hand, Lou is helping Will see a whole new perspective of life through his wheelchair and on the other hand, Will is trying his best to make Lou attain something in life. In a way you could say that while Will is bound to his chair physically, Lou is bound to her fear of unfamiliarity which restrains both of them from gaining more than what they actually can. 
 Also it's funny how two people see things in a completely different perspective. While I thought that Will was more like a gentleman, Beez considered him more of an arse (a good arse of course) 
 I just love how funny the whole book is. The sarcasm and the extent to which we can relate to almost everything that happens in the book is just wonderful. It's like a bonus to the awesome plot of the story. I can't imagine anyone not liking this book. The immaturity of Lou is hilarious and the sibling rivalry is expressed perfectly. 
 There is no part that I can mention in particular because there are many tiny and special moments that I cherished. Like Beez said, it's those little moments that make this book amazing. Another thing that separates this book from all the other ones out there is the ""This is life not fiction"" feel of it. Half of the time I expected Will to get up from his wheely and hold Lou tight but of course nothing like that happens in real life. 
 Now about the ending, I wouldn't want it to change no matter what. Even though I laid the book aside and cried my eyes out into the pillow, I still wouldn't want the ending to change. It's just another specialty of this book. It's got one of the most perfect ending in the history of perfect fiction endings. 
 Usually, no matter how much I love fangirling about a book, I won't read it again unless required but this book... I won't mind opening this book on any cold, rainy day with hot chocolate and tissues. In fact if anyone asks me for a good book I will smack their face with this one and force them to read it. Yes, it is THAT good. 
 I would gladly rate it a 5. 
 Lots of love & Pasta, 
 Raven

4,"This Blood is Thick abruptly ends the spectacular JH Williams III run on Batwoman. Shame on DC, the title went full south afrerwards. After the Medusa attack on Gotham, you know that another epic story is building up again, one that is more personal, one that involves Batman himself. 
 I love where the series is going, the marriage, the battle of the Bat-cousins with all other supporting characters thrown into the mix. Volume four sets all that up, giving us an exciting preview on what the Batwoman series can offer - the Kate-Sawyer marriage, the DEO, other members of the rogue's gallery and Batwoman's interesting relationship with Batman. The next arc could be what JH Williams III has been building up (with Rucka) since Elegy - the last arc towards a full circle. 
 But unfortunately, things aren't good because DC wanted Kate to join the mainstream Bat-stories. D*ck move New52 DC! 
 Artwork isn't Williams' but still way better than that of volume 2. You get an emerging trend here. Volume 5 MIGHT have been drawn by Williams. Shame we didn't get to see it. 
 This Blood is Thick is much more personal, a start of a could-have-been-epic story of the Williams Batwoman run. This is the farthest it will take us folks, appreciate it, then stop reading the succeeding issues."
4,"Well-done continuation of ""Farthing"", the first book of Jo Walton's trilogy about an alternate world where Britain makes peace with Hitler around 1942 and becomes a rather isolated fascist country that turns a blind eye to the war Hitler continues to wage all over Europe and in Russia. 
 I think I will sum up my thoughts about all three books when I finish the third book, ""Half a Crown""."
5,I figured out the killer about half way through & the main character's alcoholism & helplessness drove me crazy... But this is a page turner! It grips you and doesn't let you go.
4,"Jacka's excellent London-based urban fantasy series continues with a story in which Alex takes up a mystery of missing mage apprentices, with a fair amount of help from his friends and another series of really close brushes with death. The old fantasy/horror tropes that the author is drawing on are polished up nicely for this outing. Which ones, you say? Well, the depths to which some people will go in search of power and eternal life; and (view spoiler)[the haunted house. (hide spoiler)] 
 Speaking of tropes, there's also magical dueling (mostly the mostly-safe competitive kind). This review is starting to sound like the book is all recycled material, but really, how many urban fantasies out there aren't? This one makes more creative use out of the material than most, and honestly, if we all rejected every book that wasn't wildly and fantastically creative, we wouldn't have much left to read, now would we? I enjoy seeing these things re-done well. 
 Still not as good as the second one, because there's not a lot of meaningful character development. Unless learning how far Alex will go out of his way to do the right thing counts as development, and that happens early on in the book."
5,"Eerie. Wistful. Gorgeous. 
 I felt the story. The fantasy of it worked its way into my imagination and made me feel like I was experiencing something wondrous. 
 This book is like going about your day and coming across your favorite childhood lullaby playing in a music box. Beautiful, comforting but very much out of place. And it's that out of place-ness that throws you, filling you with eerie awe. Haunting and heartbreaking."

 Critically 
 Plot - 3 out of 5 stars 
 This book is a punch in the gut and there's no way around it. It's a brutal look at humanity and rape culture and how it's become so common within society today. We follow the day to day lives of the characters and it's not a linear plot line. It's dark, gritty, violent and intense. I won't be able to forget this story for a really long time. 
 Writing Style - 4 out of 5 stars 
 The writing style lent really well to the way the narrative is told. There's three different POVs and each has it's own distinct voice. It was easy to read and fast paced and engaging. It was intense, powerful and honest. It was lyrical, brutal and violent. Another punch to the gut to be quite honest. 
 Characters - 4 out of 5 stars 
 The characters in this book are so real and complex. From the main characters, to the side characters, they all feel like complete people and we're just getting a little glimpse of their lives. 
 Alex is really intense. She doesn't really understand social interactions and her point of view is almost robotic and factual in the way that she speaks and thinks. But she is also very kind and protective. She understands herself better than anyone and knows her limitations. I ended up being a huge fan of her which wasn't something that I expected when I first started reading. 
 Then there's Jack who is a douche. Honestly, there's no other way to describe him, he's a very typical asshole boy who has the world at the tip of his fingers and doesn't really think about why. He's kind of annoying but I appreciated how much he grew throughout the story. He's really torn and confused. 
 And the last protagonist is Peekay, who definitely should not go by that name because she represents something so much better. She's really sweet and kind and loving. But she's also really accustomed to the way life is and unaware of how bad things actually are. However, she's determined to improve and I really enjoyed reading from her point of view. 
 Emotionally 
 (view spoiler)[I was a bit apprehensive to read this book since I hadn't had the best experience with the author's earlier work but this book was absolutely amazing. 
 The plot was intense. We follow Alex, a girl who is known because of the death of her sister and whose life begins to change when she's befriended by another girl from school. I didn't know how this book was going to be and I was surprised with how brutality honest and intense the narrative was. We're set in a small town in the south, where kinds party in the woods and everyone has known each other since they were born. All the relationships in the book go back years and have a huge history attached to them. And the author uses this backdrop to explore a very important theme. The book is an in depth look at rape culture and how desynthesized society has become to the effects of it. We see it from a girl's perspective and from a man's perspective, we see it around us, we see it happen to the characters. There's no linear plot that we follow, no truth we're chasing, but the narrative is still addicting and fast paced. Like I said above (twice), this book is just a punch to the gut. It's real and honest, brutally so. I want to make sure to mention that there are a lot of graphic descriptions of sexual assault, animal abuse, violence and gore. I don't really know what else to say about this book that wouldn't be considered a spoiler. I just really want to stress the fact that this book is really important and I think it talks about the issue of rape culture in a way that is candid and honest, in a way that makes you really think about the way you live your life. There's a lot of ways that this could be triggering for people so I'd be conscious of that before deciding to read this book. But I honestly just want to recommend it to everyone because it's absolutely amazing and mind blowing. 
 Alex is amazing. She's the protagonist but also kind of the anti-hero of the story. However, she has such a kind and good heart. It took me awhile to get used to her point of view and narrative but it's so worth it. She's such a complex and intriguing character. I slowly came to love her because of the way she sees the world and the way she interacts with the world. At the end of the book, I just wanted to cuddle her and giver her love because she needed it! Her point of view is a punch to the gut, she's the one that really opens your eyes and makes you think but I loved it. 
 Jack bothered me at first. He's a typical asshole guy who's used to getting everything he wants in a town small enough where everyone knows his name. Reading from his point of view was kind of annoying. I didn't want to know how hard it was to not cheat on his girlfriend, like that line of thought is uninteresting to me. However, he had a lot of growth throughout the book. I think he was the character that has the most development out of everyone in the story. His emotional development is great and I didn't completely hate him by the end. 
 Peekay was the sweetest and the character that I connected to the most from the beginning. However, she was really naive and was kind of settled into her routine and the way her life had always shaped out to be. I kind of wish the ending hadn't treated her the way it did, it kind of upset me because I wanted her to feel better. She was a nice girl and her story line was actually kind of tough and intense. I wanted a more comforting end for her. 
 There are several side characters who also have an important part in the story, every character within the plot has a significant part to play. It was just an amazing reading experience, the story blew me away honestly. 
 Overall, I definitely enjoyed reading this book. I'm really glad that I read it with my friends and that we could all share our feelings through the experience. I would definitely be careful about trigger warnings for this book. As much as I would love to say that everyone should read this book, some people could be heavily triggered by the graphic and intense content that's within the story. If you can handle it, definitely give it a read because it shows how awful rape culture really is and how much we really need to be the ones to change it. (hide spoiler)]"
3,"3.5 or maybe a 4. 
 This was a great read. I loved the idea, because really, who knew chocolate could be so sacred, right? 
 It was wonderful. 
 The romance wasn't anything to complain about either. The only thing I'd say is that I wish there were a few more actual interactions and chats between Owen and Emmeline... I would have liked to see the blossoming of their romance developed a bit more, because in the book you obviously get the hint that they get closer over the weeks/months but we never get to read about any of their interactions in those weeks/months (only a few). Probably makes no sense. Me brain's not really working today :P 
 Anyways, was a lovely read."
3,"Sometimes my grown-up-ness bugs me; I wanted to LOVE this book, but I kept on thinking, ""Oh, such-and-such is going to happen next in the book,"" and then I kept on waiting for it to happen. 
 Mostly I was waiting for (view spoiler)[that wretched Aunt Lily to steal the Cook Booke and so the entire time I was reading this I felt like I was holding my breath for the inevitable, which is rather exhausting, in a way. Also, I kept on waiting for the parents to return and discover the mess their children had made and the whole truth-telling; talk about a letdown! That whole thing happened rather quickly plot-wise! Blame is mostly put on Rose as she is the one who had been given the key, but her slacker brothers get off so lightly. And then the author wraps everything up very neatly in a few tidy paragraphs with the parents saying that oh yes, they had always been proud of Rose. 
 What the hey?! 
 She goes through the ENTIRE book feeling like a nobody...and THIS is supposed to be the balm that soothes her wounded soul? A paragraph will heal years of neglect? Oooookaaaaay.... (hide spoiler)] 
 Anyway, I liked this enough to start the second book, which I cannot put down, by the way. I love the character's names and their little quirks. The settings are memorable and distinctive. The plot puts a new spin on an old idea. However, I pity Rose for her brothers who drag her down instead of building her up and for her parents who don't seem to really deal with her siblings' issues. Thankfully Rose has spunk! And every once in a while, her siblings are there for her, which makes it, as Rose noted, truly magical."

4,loved it.
4,"Not nearly as much steamy sex in this one, but a lot of adventure. Wish Reyes and Charlie could just be together like a regular couple, but I guess that's a lot to ask of the Son of Satan and the Grim Reaper. The banter between Charlie and Cookie is LOL funny! Just love this series. Bring the next one on!"
5,"The title should be a giant clue, but the plot twist centering on the identity of which character is the jilted prince and which is the assassin really threw me. (Maybe I'm a little slow?) A very different fantasy story and I look forward to reading the next book."
3,Wellllll... That was interesting lol I really don't know what to think. I thought more of the novel would be about how the father lied to everyone and trying to reconcile things on the surface. They didn't break free til the last chapter. It definitely had a few things I didn't see coming.
4,"I really liked this story, but it just seemed too short! I wanted to read more! Luckily, I have the next book in the series, so I'm good to go. :)"

 For those not familiar with the series, it kind of has that Twilight vibe at the beginning of the series but then it takes off on it's own with aliens, hybrids, secret government plots, and nasty villains. Lots of mayhem and destruction and a very possessive alpha male or two. Suspend belief and enjoy the ride. 
 SOS Bookshelf Bingo - Favorite series shelf."
3,"Derek Landy's series becomes darker as his characters grow up, but maintain their humorous edge. I still prefer Landy as a short story writer but my kids, now 19,15 and 12, who have grown up with this series, still love it. I guess they are his audience not me."
2,I don't think Amy Poehler was ready to write a book.

 A buddy read with my friends @ the MacHalo Freaks, since we really like Tigreen and Flitzbies!!! 
 What a wonderful, heartbreaking, but completely magical tale! I stayed up all night so I can engulf it and find out what happened. This Universe where people of all shapes, forms, races and genetics try to find the best way they can exist and be safe, is beautiful, colorful and still can find a way to reach inside your chest and rip your heart out! I felt very lucky to have come across this series and was able to enjoy and share it with my friends @ the MacHalos . 
 ""...""To love was to be vulnerable to pain. To laugh was to be sensitive enough for tears. To be open to joy was to be despair's fair prey."" ..."" 
 We started right where the story left off in book 2 and everything seemed hopeless for the Eldridge world and its dwindling population. Pirate Slavers are settling down and getting ready to make every Eldridge their property, using them as such and treating them in the most despicable ways possible. The ""new Queen"" realizes she has been used as their puppet and when she tries to fix it, she becomes just another one of the Slavers toys. The real Queen and cousin are recovering a board an Union ship and looking for allies who could help in a discreet manner, since the Planet has been hidden up to this point and they would like to keep it so for as long as possible. 
 Captain Reese stays behind with her Tigreen friend and couple of the locals to try to obstruct the Pirates plans as much as they can and do some recon. This is how we meet a funny Eldridge priest named Val and I loved him at first sight:-) They all met at the real, old, romantic castle which the Queen deeded to Reese and which has been abandoned for years and is in complete disrepair. Reese had her rude awakening as far as her notions about such things generated through her addiction to romance novels. I might have similar delusions as well, since I suffer from the same addiction myself:-) 
 The clashes between the different traditions, races, understandings, and topped with the violence brought on by the Invaders and long standing political rivelries is intense, cruel, devastating, and just as emotionally unsettling as any mortal conflict in reality... I laughed, loved and cried with the characters and was left with a hope that maybe, just maybe, if we all listen to each other, discover our own strengths and weaknesses, and make a conscious decision to work together, there might be good things awaiting us at the end of the road... 
 ""...""Sarel. It is not humility to assume every responsibility is yours to bear. It is not wise. And it is not just, nor kind. You must let go of your need to feel that everything that befalls you is yours to mend, for at the root of that assumption is a great flaw: the belief that you can control everything. Continue to nourish that flaw and it will grow into the fault that will shatter you as surely as the sword poorly made.""..."" 
 I don't want to give away any part of the plot, so I would like to encourage you, readers of Sci-fi and Fantasy, to give this series a try - the first book is the weakest and they get better with every book, so don't give up! For me, this series gave me a taste of this Universe and I plan to eat it all up ! 
 Now I wish you all Happy Reading and many more wonderful books to come!"
4,"I liked the ending waaaay better than the movie's 
 Borrowed from Charlene!"
3,"This is a quick read. You can't help but examine the health of your own closest relationships as the plot develops. Unfortunately both main characters drove me crazy. They were extremely selfish, especially Amy. I couldn't understand most of the decisions they made. It was interesting to see how these things contributed to the state of their relationship, what brought them together and what kept them apart. Bev's character development ends on a hopeful note but I didn't completely buy the story's resolution where Amy is concerned."
3,"No what I expected. This story make you muse about the ethics of surrogate mothers and abortion. About the rightness of sacrificing your own opportunities of being a mother for the ""well being of the whole"", that is, for the surviving of humanity. (view spoiler)[ If I were Gaia, I would try to recuperate every single egg that was taken from me (remember Petra Arkanian in Shadow of the Giant?). It would be hell to see a kid in the street identical to my own and know he/she has my genes, that he/she is biologically mine and that the egg from which the baby was born was stolen from me. Pure hell. 
 I'm glad Gaia is not the ruler of the new society they are trying to form. I don't think she is mature enough to do it. But I love she finally got it right with Leon and together conformed a family. Leon has been the sweetest in here. (hide spoiler)] 
 There are deaths that brought me to tears and surprises that formed a knot in my throat. Be prepared for some strong scenes and even stronger emotions."
4,"The first english Agatha Christie book I read (I don't why this one was not published by RBA) and I enjoy greatly. I think that reading in portuguese are not as good as english. Or I am mistaken and this one is very good book and there's nothing with RBA translations. 
 This book begins with a third person view of a house with a rich lady and a dog and her spoilt nephews that want her aunts money. 
 I was interesting to read about Emily Arundell. She was a great strong female character. It's unfortunally that she died... or get murdered. Hmm... 
 We've got the usual suspects: 
 Wilhemnina Lawson - Her companion 
 Niece Bela Tanios - a mother of two children married with a greek (badly seen in the uk, to marry a foreigner) 
 Theresa - Only want money so she can have all the good things in life and never lifting a finger 
 Charles - Only want the money to have is debauched life. 
 Dr Tanios - Married to Bela, wants money to live a better life and be a doctor 
 Rex Donalson - fiance of Theresa. Wants money to work in his field of science 
 And Bob, the dog - he just wants his ball. 
 The next 350 pages is told by the perspective of Captain Hastings as he tells in his own view what Poirot do to solve a mystery. If there are. 
 Top notch from Christie's mind. Good story with a good ending. 
 Who was the killer? Maybe it was Bob. All fingers... or claws, point to him!"
5,"Goblin fruit has taken root in San Francisco, killing off the 1/2 bloods and changelings. October ""Toby"" Daye is shocked when she takes this problem before the Queen of the Mist only to finds herself sentenced to exile. 
 A race against the clock ensues for Toby to come up with a plan to keep herself out of exile while fighting her most difficult battle yet...and it all started with a pie in the face. 
 Chimes at Midnight finally gives our fantastic heroin, Toby, proof beyond a doubt that she has friends that have her back. If you have a favorite October Daye character, chances are they had a role in this story, Seanan McGuire pulls out all the stops and brings everyone into this imaginative plot. 
 I loved this story. Heart pounding action, riveting revelations, incredible imaginative twists and turns and all the characters we've come to love.

5,"Got this as an ARC though giveaway. 
 Before I say anything really meaningful, let me simply say: 
 Kick-Ass Drag Queen in Silver Spangly Bikini Underwear! 
 What other reason do you need to read it? 
 Let's face it, the urban fantasy market is glutted in terms of books told from a first person point of view, especially when that person is a kick-ass chick. So why, you ask rightly, should I read this book? 
 Because it is a several cuts above all those other fantasy books. 
 It's true that Priest does draw heavily from current trends in UF and at first, any reader can be forgiven for worrying that this is going to be a rehash of Anita Blake, at least the early ones. 
 It's not. If anything, it's what all the other UF books should be, but never could be. 
 The first thing that stands out, as another review has noted, is the use of voice. Unlike many other first pov UF books, where the kick ass heroine is always right and always perfect, Priest presents a more layered character. She isn't a saint, but she sure is funny. Not only does she poke fun at herself and everything around her, she feels real. It is like she is right next to you telling the story. Even when series such as Anita Blake and the Hollows were really good, they weren't this good. You catch yourself thinking, ""Oh no, you just didn't say that"" because the voice is so active to use the word ""she"" would just be wrong. 
 The second thing is that the characters are presented as really, truly human. With the final confrontation scene, the reader is on the side of the angels because the angels are human, not saints. Too often in UF, the central character is a saint or painted as a saint - take for instance Rachel from the Hollows or even better Anita Blake. The only difference, as several critics have pointed out, between Blake and the bad guys is that Blake says she is motivated by love. Such an problem isn't here. Red may not be a saint, but she is human. She doesn't pretend to be a saint. 
 The third is the plotting. The ending makes sense and is one of those endings that fit. 
 I love this book. If you are tired of UF, give this book a try. It is wonderful. It is brillant. It is what UF should be."
4,A good read. I haven't read anything in this series in a long time. It was good to catch up. Eve has to track a murderer that was release from prison. But can she do it before Roake is poisoned?
3,3 stars - Contemporary Romance
2,"2.5 stars. 
 This pushed the world of fiction believability 3 steps too far. I liked the characters, but felt this short story did not do their story justice."
3,"3.5 stars 
 Can't say I'm sold on the series but I'll read Sed's book at least - I found myself more interested in him than Brian at times while reading this!"
5,"Many characters pass through the story, and their arcs do not always end in explanation, and I appreciate that harsh reality as much as it saddened me. I was left with a lot more questions than answers after reading The Book, but isn't that the sign of something unique? The Book of the Unnamed Midwife is a rare treat, one that is alarming and dark but will move you nonetheless."
5,"I am really not one for philosophies on life or general pontifications but this book is nothing of that sort. It is really interesting, has a great plot, and the ending makes you think."
3,"Overall book rating: 3.5 Stars 
 Audio book: Narrator - Nick J Russo 4 Stars 
 Book cover: 2.5 Stars 
 It was just a nice in between book."
5,"I thought it was going to be like other book that told the same story from a different POV, but this book surprised me. I like the way they continue the current event, which was their honeymoon, and told Will's POV from the other two books as Lake asked him to tell her. Then it switched back to present. It continued like this the whole book and ended with epilogue that made me happy with the way the author ended this series. I butterflying love this trilogy!!"
3,"It was OK but it didn't really live up to the rating or the hype for me. I didn't love the style, the characters or the story. It was honestly more like a 2 1/2 star read for me. 
 I was looking for total immersion reading as an escape, so I went to my long neglective ""to-read"" shelf and looked for the highest rated books that I still hadn't read from years ago. This one got the call. But for me it didn't deliver on promise of greatness and definitely not a ""must read"" IMO."
4,"*no spoilers* 
 I originally planned on reviewing each book but here, I decided to review the series as a whole. 
 Even though I met a few disappointments along the way, I really fell in love with this series. 
 Rose Hathaway. She was reckless, infuriating, brave and confident. Sure. I got so pissed at her sometimes it makes me want to hurt even my book! Blasphemy! (So sorry about that book, btw.) Sometimes, I was like, ""Oh crap Rose, you idiot!!"" while other times, I was like, ""Well done, Rose. You made me proud."" She wasn't perfect at all but she was an overall kickass heroine for me. I mean, this series wouldn't work without her. 
 Vasilisa Dragomir. Wow. I was awed and filled with wonder. At first, it was like she was so weak, so dependent on Rose that she can't do anything on her own. But really, she's the definition of strength and compassion. 
 The friendship between Rose and Lissa was so admirable. Yeah, they fought sometimes but it's natural if you care about each other. I like that they guard each other's backs. 
 The romance. I was definitely rooting for a certain ship but I can't help but feel sad for the other guy. It was awful. This is where Rose really pissed me off. I swear I want to punch her when she broke his heart. I worry about him now. 
 The secondary characters was also well established. They weren't bland and boring. They are what made the series even more amazing for me. They are important, not just used as tools but they play a major role. 
 The writing hooked me up from the very start up to the last book. It was fast-paced and the rush of adrenaline was maddening. I like how Mead wrote the fighting scenes. The main characters definitely didn't come out unharmed. 
 This series broke my heart. I know. This line seems kind of overused, isn't it? But I swear, my heart was ripped into pieces. I smile and hurt for the characters. I cried with them, I felt their pain. It was like I was journeying with them myself. I really liked it when that happens. 
 The problem with the book being the end of a series is that it gets a lot of high, sometimes even absurd, expectations. Like, this one should be perfect and everything must be in order. The reader must be fulfilled. And maaan, was I ever. The end left me satisfied and also left me wanting more. Does that make any sense? One thing's for sure, though. I'll definitely remember this series for a long, long time."
4,"I have seen a lot of mixed reviews on this book, but I have to tell you ... I loved it! Great world building, wonderful characters (Rowan!) and good pacing. I was basically riveted from beginning to end. I can't wait for the next book in this trilogy!"
3,"Read in a compilation 
 Rating: 3 / 5 
 This is a classical horror story from Edgar Allen Poe. This is the story of a man and his friend sampling a bottle of liquor, only for things to turn drastically wrong. 
 I didn't think much of this story. It started off fair enough, and was well written, but the story made no sense. There were no reasons behind the main character's actions, and it caused a lot of confusion for me, trying to understand why this was happening. I enjoyed the story, but it was confusing and didn't make much sense whatsoever. 
 The sense behind the story really annoyed me. There was none whatsoever, from what I could discern, and it made the story had to follow. 
 I wouldn't personally recommend this to anyone, but there might be some classical and/or horror lovers out there who find this more enjoyable than I did. 
 It was alright. It wasn't the best story to read in the world, and I read it very quickly and mostly skimmed it, just to get through it and progress through the Terrifying Tales compilation."
1,"Not only does her name really annoy me, she's a whole package deal of annoy-the-fuck-out-of-you. Ladies and gentlemen, meet Zoey Redbird the most self-important, all-judging, so-far-up-her-own-ass-she-can-see-her-tonsils and is unbelievably disatisfied with everything. 
 Zoey is prattling on in the school hallway when she spots the vampire - whoops, sorry i mean vampYre, in a way only Andrew from Buffy would say, and he 'marks' her by pressing his thumb to her forehead, leaving a blessed tattoo and declares that she will enter the House of Night, a boarding schools for people chosen to be vamps - I'm not kidding, a boarding school for humans who are SLOOOOOOOOOWLY transforming into vampires. 
 WHAT FUCKERY IS THIS? FIRST THE SPARKLING AND FROLICKING IN THE SUNLIGHT THEN THIS? Dracula, Nosferatu and hell, even Lestat and the Count from Sesame Street are offended!!! 
 Of course, our beloved disatisfied Mary-Sue, who thinks its like so kewl to bitch about everything by mentioning pop culture losers. Like when she was describing Neferet, a somewhat teacher who takes an immediate shine to Zoey for some strange reason, must be her insipid charm, in several ways i can describe as a severe girl-crush by saying that Neferet was thin but not in a cracked-out Paris Hilton chic like a lot of skinny girls are. 
 Paris Hilton, really? The Ashton Kutcher and Tom Cruise mentions weren't enough? You're supposed to sound like a teenager Casts, considering one of you is, no one talks about being skinny by saying Paris Hilton chic or talk about how Ashton married an older woman WHO THE FUCK CARES? 
 There was also the total lack of ANYTHING Vampiric in any sense of the word, apparently in this universe, anyone special - including fucking Shakespeare, was a fucking vampYre, so all of us poor unfortunate mortal souls are just ewwww, talentless vermin and nothing good comes out of us. 
 Back to the Mary-Suing, she arrived at the school, trashes a girl who was giving her boyfriend a blowjob and continuing on and on about her severe slutshaming of everyone - BTW (view spoiler)[ she has sex with her teacher in the third book and its all fine and dandy in her book when she had a fucking boyfriend at the time but noooo girl pleasing her BOYFRIEND already is a total sluuuuut (hide spoiler)] 
 That girl turns out to be her sudden rival, Aphrodite - I'm NOT joking about that name - who is the stereotypical blonde skinny bitch who is mysteriously out to get Zoey-Sue and bully her like a schoolyard kid, NYAHNYAHNYAAAAAAH! *blows raspberry*...yes Zoey-Sue, very intimidating villain. 
 Apparently Zoey-Sue thinks she's being clever when she says Aphrodite can't one up her because 'I have boobs too.'...good for you, Zoey, enough with the mentioning of boobs in this book, please and enough ass-kissing for Neferet (GOD THOSE NAMES!) 
 Up until the last 20 pages, we hear nothing but bitching and groaning and Zoey's new entourage, which consists of stereotypical country-bumpkin, Stevie Rae, who is obsessed with Kenny Chesny, who is, guess what? A vampYre! I hardly believe a country singer who sings 'She Thinks My Tractor Is Sexy' is anyway vampiric - A COUNTRY-SINGER! Casts, do you have ANY idea how sunny the South is? - and the others consist of a 1-dimensional biracial pair who call themselves the Twins, the black one, Shaunee gets severely scrutinized by Zoey-Sue, who in the end establishes that Shaunee's nice hair is a weave. FUCK. YOU. ZOEY. - Last, but not least, the accessory needed in every YA novel, the GBFF - Gay Best Friend...poor kid, at least she gave him a normal name, Damian and not something like Andray, Pepper, Pierre, Cambry, Clarince, Quintyn... 
 You know what's my biggest problem? My Ex-Best friend was just like her, but like people in the real world, which of course exclude Mary-Sues, bitches like Zoey have no friends for more than 2 months until people get fed-up. Which makes me hate this book even more, WE DON'T WANT THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE BITCH WE ALL HATE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, CASTS."
3,"Last Will and Testament started out really strong for me. Mostly because of Lizzie's amazing narrative voice and unapologetic style. How unapologetic? Well the story starts out with her screwing another girl's boyfriend when the police show up and inform her that her parents are dead. 
 Lizzie's entire life changes then, when she has to adult-up and take on her two younger brothers while cleaning up her life at Radleigh university. To do that, she needs the help of her uptight TA, Connor Lawson. 
 Lizzie's voice started out and remained the very best aspect of this novel for me. I would say there were a lot of great things about Last Will and Testament. Great characterisation, hot romance action, maintenance of drama and story line, good writing. 
 It was just the little things that got me, ya know? How quickly Connor and Lizzie's relationship sparked up. The whole will-they-won't they that came on really thick and fast and then just eased up abruptly in a way that made me question its legitimacy. 
 Don't get me wrong, despite these criticisms it was still a great read, that I thoroughly enjoyed. And all the sexy times were greatly appreciated. No. Really. 
 I just really loved Lizzie. Like so much. Such a flawed and well-rounded character. And Connor was delicious when he finally removed that stick from his ass. Oops, did I just say that out loud? 
 So whilst it wasn't a perfect read for me, it was pretty damn good, and I think a lot of people are going to like this one."
5,"Creative, original, witty-I'd have loved it even if it didn't take place in Seattle-a city close enuf I have a love/hate relationship with. Bernadette, don't worry, there's no such place as Madrona Hill on Orcas Island, although sometimes I think there should be! Bee, don't get crazy on me, but I've been to a Cliff Maas lecture and it's even better than his blogs! 
 PS I don't like the cover or the title-would never have picked this up except for a friend's rec. Just goes to show :)"
5,"My rating: 4.7 
 WOW! I've never ever read a book like this! My thoughts are scrambled and I'm speechless and confused over how to put my thoughts out. When I read the synopsis of this book it seemed centred around identity crisis in a school. Then I started reading it & I knew I would be hooked right from the first sentence!! see, on that first page itself, you get that Arnold Spirit 'junior' is fucking HILARIOUS! - witty, smart with some cynicism thrown in. On top of this great character, there's his drawing! I LOVED them and they made an already great story even better! Arnold/Junior starts in a self-deprecating (or maybe/and yet realistic) funny and whip smart style. He describes (more like converses about) his reservation, the whole atmosphere of it, and the people so so very realistically yet in a cynical teenage voice that leaps out of the pages right at you. The main theme, atleast what I kept on feeling while reading it, was despair (in the 1st quarter) and sadness and pain (in the rest of the book) but Junior coloured them with his dry sharp sense of humour. I was smiling and laughing even through the heavy feelings. Sometimes there's just plain hilarity and other times, there's an underlying painful sadness. It hurt a lot while reading.Then there's the time after he transfers to the 'white' school to forge his own path. That was some of the best character development I've ever seen in YA which is mainly because of his voice & actions. That was the moment when those seeds of doubt regarding his identity took root. Then there's the huge event of deaths in his family (including the other people of the rez) ; these changed his perspective so much- in the end he was more comfortable in his own skin.This is one hell of a coming of age story. I wanted to word out by point because there's so much in such a tiny book. 
 Why You Should Read This Book: 
 1. I LOVED the title of the book even though it's a mouthful. It's lucid and real and 'absolutely true'! *grins* 
 2. I agree with Junior that no matter what your language a picture can communicate with practically anyone and everyone. I think Junior had such a mindset because of the racism (nasty, deep and too much) they suffer. I had no idea that Indians are impacted so much by racism- they're hit almost everywhere. Culture is how you live & if it's dead then you're just as dead inside... 
 3. This huge point in the identity crisis of Junior is how he feels 'white' on his own rez and amongst his own people (even though he simply decided to go to a 'white' school) though at Reardan High, he feels 'Indian'. Even through all that he faces, by being himself, he gains popularity in the High school hierarchy. He gets to be a normal kid which is why he doesn't let anyone on that he's poor. (but they still know about it...) 
 4. Junior's disparate views of his home are normal and real.I liked that scene when Rowdy and Junior climb that huge pine tree and discover a beautiful moment while watching their home. It's a small town- not important or happy at all with people having problems left, right and centre especially with alcohol ( I didn't know that so many people could be alcoholics and in various degrees even!) but there are so many good things like his love for his land, family the people on his rez... 
 5. Junior describes things as they are and doesn't sugar-coat or romanticize. 
 6. There's insight on different types of addictions like alcohol and Bulimia & how ethnicity or class come into consideration when people are actually living their lives -that they have problems no matter who they are. 
 7. I don't know very many Indian stereotypes but they seem to be wrong. Indians have history and culture and tradition. There's beauty in it and I feel really sad that it's been near-to destroyed just for some handful people who're inebriated with power and greed. I loved the sense of community in their culture. It's ironic that the ideas that were trying to be squashed yesterday are the same ones that are respected and valued the most today. I loved the comparison between the white town society and the Indian rez community. 
 Blunt, factual, ironic, loving, sensitive, all of Junior's qualities help him find himself even through despair, pain, rage (they all make him intense). These in themselves are what drew me to love the book so much! 
 I'm gonna read more of him now! Keep on writing Mr. Alexie!!!"
5,"Great combination of comedy, romance, sizzling scenes 
 with a touch of mystery asking whodunit. 
 Olivia Sullivan had bad luck with sex. Her first encounter 
 produced eggplant penis and her second the grim reaper 
 claimed her partner's orgasm. 
 He came, and then he went, which left me with a hell of a lot of fear and guilt. 
 Is it any wonder her vagina closed shop! 
 Until Catcher Mains, a GBI agent and sex on a stick. 
 Immediately I adored Livvie. Female mortician, county

 I like strong women who know what they want and aren't afraid 
 to go for it. 
 OMG, Olivia's nana was a piece of work with the mouth of a dockworker. She reminded me of my granny. 
 I fell hard for Catcher Mains! 
 Catcher Mains was mouth-watering and charming with an unending 
 sexual appetite. His dirty mouth heated up my girlie parts! 
 Add in an amusing visit to a nudist village, double dongs 
 and a villain who places them in danger and you will be 
 flipping through the pages at lightning speed.

5,"Real rating: 4.5 stars 
 A really good book. in my favourites for this year. The book was a little different than what i imagined from the summary. Its based off 1001 Arabian Nights, (which i havent actually read) and I was picturing this small clan/community in the desert with a guy who takes a wife and kills her every night. and then this girl volunteers and he doesnt kill her, but they are still all living in this little community in the desert and she falls in love with him and finds out he isnt a bad guy. 
 Okay, so the main guy is actually the king of this country and he takes a wife and kills them every night. And the main girl volunteers to get revenge for her friend by planning to kill him. And she woos him and he kind of gives in and doesnt kill her. And so the main guy and girl are living in this palace in the middle east somewhere i guess since their clothes and food choices seem to be turkish or middle eastern. It was just different to what i expected. Its not as much romance, lovey dovey as it is YA fiction. there is a love triangle involved in the book (of course). and there is another evil king who i can see playing a part in the next book. 
 Despite it not meeting my expectations, it was still a great book. Definitely some Celaena themes with the main character at times, but I couldn't put the book down and read it in one day. Recommended to all YA lovers"
4,a good read indeed... love it
5,HA! This was hilarious. Epically hilarious :)
4,I liked this! it was cute and the intrigue was good.
4,"I just love this series. As always, this installment is fast-paced. I love me some rock'n'roll and of course, Stella sings Mace some Black by Pearl Jam, my very favoritest band ever, so this book is a lock for me. I love Stella and her whole crazy band, seeing the whole crew is awesome, though I could do without the reminders of everyone's drama in every book. I know why it's there, but I don't appreciate it. 
 Rolling on to the next one...like a crazy train."
5,"5/5 stars 
 This book caused me to have a near death experience. I'll explain: after finishing this book, which was mega brilliant, I had a sudden realisation: I don't think I have the sequel!!! And with that cliffhanger ending, I thought I was going to die, I kind of just wanted to curl up in a ball and cry. But, don't worry, it turns out I did have the second book and so I didn't die of curiosity or withdrawal. My heart goes out to all the people who had to wait a year for the sequel, I mean it almost killed me walking to my bookshelf and grabbing the sequel (after my almost panic attack, of course). 
 Now for the real review. There really isn't much to say besides perfection. I mean I loved this book from the start to the beginning. The writing was beautiful and I got so caught up in the words, I really couldn't put this book down. The story in itself was amazing and so addictive. 
 The characters were a stand out for me. The romance was breathtakingly beautiful and sweet but so full of sadness. I really just wanted to give Khalid a hug, I mean his words practically oozed melancholy. Shahrzad was also a pretty great character, although, I did get so frustrated that she wasn't nicer to Khalid. I mean, he basically pours his heart out to her every time he speaks. I did really enjoy her strength and her loyalty though. 
 Everything I love about this book just comes right back to the the author's writing style. It was phenomenal, addicting and beautifully written. When I read that this was Renee Ahdieh's debut, I couldn't believe it. She is truly talented in her writing and I can't wait to read more from her."
4,"This is so much like my fav Sexton, Promises, Strawberries for Dessert, Between Sinners and Saints! 
 The best thing are the characters. They are wonderful and I could read about them doing boring stuff an still be entertained."

 Writing : 5 Stars ..... I was instantly drawn to the story and the characters involve... 
 Premise : 5 Stars ..... Vampires who each holds different elemental power / A human Librarian and a powerful vampire with fire element. 
 Main characters : 
 Beatrice - Smart, beautiful, cheery and easy to like. 
 Giovanni - Powerful, handsome, mysterious, wise and intense.) 
 Was there action and suspense? Yes there was... Although I find it not quite a big build up on the suspense and action part, and I kinda wish there was more to it, but that's just my preference. And, in a way, the story kinda gets away with it, as I feel like the main focus of the story is more towards Beatrice and Giovani's interactions, which I found captivating and sincere... specially Giovani's. 
 Since this is just the start of a series, some mystery are still left unsolved, like with Beatrice father. 
 I couldn't have picked a better ending. I'm lucky I don't have to wait for the next book cause then I'd be left with a hole in my heart. :)"
3,"Was I I only one expecting something diferent? I love Lauren and her way of speaking,but this book seemed to me like it went nowhere. So many info that was unnecessary, our of topic or simple rambling. 
 It was good but I think it could've been better."
4,"4,5 Stars!!! 
 Cash Davenport you are awesome!!! 
 Contains spoilers! 
 This book picks up right after the epilogue of Down to You. It's sexy, full on suspence and many family secrets. 
 And the biggest of them all: Nash! Yeah the twins are back.. Both of them.. 
 And they are both sexy and dangerous! 
 Let's start with Cash and Olivia, their relationship flourished in this book.. They had so many sex scenes everytime he saw her: 
 But also they had romantic momments.. 
 The dual POV was a great element and i wasn't bored not even for a second! 
 Now on the rest, Nash is here, i didn't see that coming, Gavin is a great friend, Marissa had an epiphany and Ginger is always hilarious.. 
 "" Sweet mother of sex, they're triplets!"" 
 "" Um, no. But I do have something I'd like to run by you."" 
 "" Is it about dildo selection? Because those things can be tricky 
 if you've never bought one before."" 
 I'm so intrigued by this epilogue again. Who knows what is in his mind.. Nash is definitely the bad boy.. I hope he has a few tattoos like his brother.. 
 THOUGHTS ABOUT THE BOOK 
 - Cash and his hotness.. 
 - I don't trust/like Taryn.. 
 - Gavin and Ginger would be a pair made in heaven.. Both extremely amusing.. 
 - Marissa has the hots for Nash!!! 
 - At the begining it felt like Olivia had lost her witty self.. 
 - I hated her mother.. She was cruel.. 
 - An easy read.. With likeable characters. 
 - Their plan was very risky! 
 - He actually took a bullet for her... AWWWWWW! 
 - The scene in the VIP room! woow! 
 - I think i need a few shots of Jack!!!"
2,it is so... unfinished.
5,"When others say that there is adult content in this graphic novel I didn't really take it seriously, but there is SO much adult content. 
 This story is so unique and novel. There are so many different creatures or races or whatever you want to call them and they are truly unique. I really enjoyed the narration. I thought it was well placed and funny. 
 This story only gives you a taste of the universe, yet at the end of the graphic novel you can't wait to see more."
3,This was a really fun book.
5,"Holy. Crap. Excuse my language but holy crap is the only way I can accurately portray what I am thinking now that I am done this book. This is, without a doubt, my favourite book I've ever read. Ever. There is nothing that compares or even comes close to how I feel about this book. If I could choose one fictional world to live in, I would sacrifice Hogwarts to go to this circus. 
 For the first time ever, I wrote a list of things I wanted to talk about in my review. I just don't want to forget anything. 
 To explain The Night Circus to someone would take ages. It is impossible to explain this book without telling the entire story and giving away spoilers. The blurb of the book does a good job but really doesn't portray the book as amazing as it is. 
 This book is a puzzle. In the beginning there are so many characters and storylines that are to separate from each other that it initially feels like you're looking at a brand new 1000 piece puzzle and you have no where to start. But gradually as you read you get the frame of the story built, like the outside of the puzzle. Then you work on the inside and as it starts coming together you start seeing the brilliance of it and things you never noticed before and that shock and surprise you. This book does that. When the pieces of this puzzle start coming together the book goes from wow to amazing. There is no better way to describe this book than a puzzle. 
 The Night Circus manages to bring you into another world entirely. I just spent the last few days in an entire different world than the one I am currently in and I didn't want to leave it. Morgenstern manages to create this amazing setting in your head with this vivid imagery and description. Truly some of the best writing I have ever seen. I almost hate her for creating a place where I cannot go because I wish more than anything I could see this circus in person. Although, she does manage to make you feel like you are apart of the story, like you're more than just a bystander watching everything happen. You feel like you play a key role in this story. 
 Another aspect of the book is the little bits where she is writing directly to you. Telling you to imagine that you are in the circus. I thought this was for an added bonus, trying to make it seem more real, but at the end finding out what it was actually was the most fitting ending. The entire book was brought together full circle with that last line. 
 The characters are outstanding. I won't go into details with all of them because there is simply too much to say and not enough words left in my mind to explain. The characters and character development were stunning. If I could give her an award for writing I would. They are intricate and delicate and strong and extremely complex and they are all amazing. And for once I found a book where I didn't hate a single character. I didn't even dislike a single character. Even the background characters that are unimportant are loved because they are all so important to the story. They are the puzzle piece to the story that, without this piece, the entire puzzle falls apart. So kind of like the glue. 
 This book is not confusing, at all. It has a lot of things that you don't understand, but it brings with it a sense of patience. There is no rush to find anything out. And I love that. I've never felt that before. Things you don't understand are all eventually explained, but even if they aren't you don't care. The ending is still a bit more than I fully understood, but I just don't care because it was all so beautiful 
 I doubt anyone has read my entire review for this book, but if you have managed to read to the end of it and you are still not convinced to read this book, I STRONGLY urge you to do so. I am so passionate about this book and I have a feeling I will live to love it for years and years to come. 
 Such a book hangover inducing book though. 
 Book Challenge book #42: A Book With Magic"
3,"So, first of all: this, in my opinion, doesn't read like a YA book, but a middle grade book. I'd have liked to know this beforehand, since I found myself bored at times, the ending was predictable and the story was full of adventures and instant love. The elements of a middle grade book, not a fantasy book at a YA level. Sorry, am I explaining myself? Let's just leave at that for now. 
 My two brothers, technically brilliant but lacking in sense. 
 Ah, this book. I wanted to start this series a long time ago, but I never found the oportunity. Until last week, when a dearest friend of mine told me there was a bargain in Amazon and the three whole books of the trilogy cost the absurd prize of 17EUR. You know what I did next. 
 I read this book in three sittings, each of them of around 110-120 pages. Having in mind that this is a 350-page book, which I could read in one single sitting, that was quite a slow pace. Why was that? It wasn't because of my busy schedule, but because this was a slow book, full of descriptions and a lot of tell and not enough show. You know I hate that. I'm finding that lately descriptions don't bother me that much, if they are done correctly (which they were, if something, Ransom Riggs writes beautifully), but I can't stand paragraphs and paragraphs of adventures. I. Just. Can't. 
 It was all fun and games until the paragraphs came. 
 Letting the beautiful descriptions but full-of-letter pages that bored me at times aside, I have to say that the plot was really original and gripping. Monsters, kids with superpowers, time travel, historical fiction... All in one. Perfect. I loved that. 
 But, I didn't like the characterization. Like I said before, I found this book to be more middle grade-ish than YA, and the characters were a big reason for that conclusion of mine. They were plain, the good were good and the bad were bad. They represented 1940s kids, yet they acted the same way as the protagonist, who is a 21st century character. Uhm, what? Not a good way of portraying it, in my honest opinion. 
 Overall, however, the book was a good read. Plain characters and some boring and unnecessary parts, yes, but the plot and the writing style made for it. And, let's be honest, taking three days to finish a book isn't that much time, and I'm sure I'll enjoy the next two remaining books and the Tim Burton film. Let's pray for that, and stay peculiar, lovebirds."
5,"NO NO NO, DON'T DO THIS TO ME...... 
 DON'T FORCE ME TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK LIKE THIS 
 If the first book was good, this book was amazing. 
 If the first book was exciting, this book was nerve-racking. 
 If the first book took me a week to read, this book took me a couple of hours. 
 I have no words. This book occupied every nerve during every second the last couple of hours. 
 And it is probably going to bother me a lot for the coming months, because, you know, CLIFFHANGER LVL 100000"
5,"In a lot of books like this, I feel that the action is rushed in the end to finish the story and more time is spent delving into feelings. This one, however, had plenty of action and I did not feel like it was over before it began. Despite the heroine being typical of the genre, I did liked her. As with most of these books, other characters really help and I liked them as well. Sometimes it got a little slow, but I'll read the others."
4,"If you dont like the WtNV podcast, you aren't going to find something in this book that you like. It very much is in keeping with the tone, even those I felt that sometimes it was a bit too on the nose about the community radio program itself. 
 It was also much more depressing then the WtNV podcast. Night Vale is often about beauty in sadness, but this was a tale of growing up, growing old, growing distant and apart, and that was really kind of hard for me. It was still beautiful, but there were sometimes where I just wish it would crawl under my skin and pose the usual creepy metaphysical questions of Night Vale rather than dwell so heavily on its mortal topics. 
 And sadly, some of the mystery of Night Vale felt dispelled, and tahts really the number thing that it has going for it. I liked the description of the inside of the library, but not the description of the librarians. Meh. 
 Still, it was Night Vale, a town that I have grown to love. I would like to see another book just on Old Woman Josie and the Ericas. I think thatd be a fun graphic novel at the very least. Reading and listening to night Vale is like being home. After all, all our towns might be a little bit more like Night Vale then we would like to admit."
2,"As a huge Austen fan I have been wanting to read this for ages and now that I have finally picked it up I am trying to decided how much I liked it. 
 The story is one of intrigued and kept me wanting to read throughout, with the images of Pemberley linked with a brutal murders you can hardly stop yourself wanting to know more. For me it answers a lot of those questions that most Pride and Prejudice fans have been asking for years, but at the same time the characters seem slightly off; whether this is getting used to the change in style I'm not sure. Though the story doesn't centralise completely on Elizabeth and Darcy, I often found their interaction disappointing and leaving something to be desired. 
 But above all this I still enjoyed P.D.James attempt at bringing some of the world's best loved literary characters back to life and would recommend to both crime and classic readers."
5,"This is what results from a writer who knows how to craft a tale with many parts and no loose ends. The characters have dimension and pathos. The author knows what he's talking about but doesn't feel the need to impress you with his knowledge. You won't recognize all of the gods in this novel, but you won't need to because they are consistent and alive on the page, showing you who they are. A fine, fine work."
3,"Oh god, I hated every minute of this book but my friend insisted I read it all the way through. 
 Don't get me wrong, it's actually a very good book, but so opposite to my reading tastes. Each chapter was more horrific and depressing than the one before, and I hope I get some credit in the next life for all the time I spent suffering. 
 Thanks a lot, Jannine! :-)"
3,"The beginning was so good! The last 80% was so bad.... 
 I was intrigued by the premise --- evil angels --- and by our heroine. However, neither one lived up to their potential, especially not the latter. The author sets our heroine up as a tom-boy who likes to work on cars in her spare time...and yet, perhaps because the author has never actually worked on a car, our heroine passes up all opportunities to fix the endlessly broken cars on their road trip. 
 The angels were one-dimensionally bad. Our love interest got boring pretty quickly. Blah."
5,"i thought this was a terrific book - unique and well-written with lots of great details. the characters were engaging, the plot kept humming along and the settings were fresh. i sped through it and quite enjoyed it."
4,This was a very interesting book. It was dark in places and suspenseful. One of those stories that makes you wonder what is going to happen next. I really did like this book and would like to read more by this author.
4,"In a fantasy medieval kingdom, Lady Renee de Winter is the only girl to have lasted this far training to be a Servant of the Crown at the royal Academy (a.k.a., training to be a knight). Unrest and political instability are threatening the new young king, and Renee is put to the test when the danger hits close to home. 
 What with all the comparisons to Tamora Pierce, I was both excited (medieval fantasy girl power action story!) and apprehensive (first novel and seriously who is as good as Tamora Pierce I am just setting myself up for disappointment). All of the above were justfied. 
 The Good 
 It's so nice to have a book that doesn't just hit a currently-popular genre and throw in a handful of tropes. The focus in this book isn't the situation that dictates the story (such as dystopian/apocalyptic books) or character's emotions (such as teenage-true-love, the focus of approximately 90% of all YA books right now), but Renee's journey to learn, to train, and to team up with others and resolve a bad situation. 
 The world seems interesting and is set up so you feel like it still exists beyond the scope of the story, rather than only things relevant to the immediate narrative being mentioned, which can lead to a flimsy world. 
 The villains are actually worthy of a story. Shades of gray exist. People usually use their brains. Characters actually collaborate. 
 The Bad. Or Less-Than-Good, Anyway. 
 First, Renee tends to see things as black or white. Now, that is a character flaw and it's something that is part of the story (rather than an annoying character trait we're stuck reading about), but that didn't stop me from wanting to shake her several times. She also has some maturing to do, but she is sixteen. 
 Capitalization. Students attend the Academy (OK-a name, a proper noun) to be either Magistrates (argh!) or Servants of the Crown, which almost makes sense, since it's a high position with a special name, but continually seeing ""blah blah Servant,"" ""yackitty Servant blabbity"" drove me nuts. I wish a different title had been used (since I understand that an uncapitalized ""servant"" might have created confusion), or even just your basic ""knight."" Also, I think mages Heal people. Gargh. 
 The story could have used smoothing overall. Most characters, though not flat, felt lacking some depth. Renee's obstinacy contributed to a story that sometimes seemed to just plod from one point to the next. The world could have used more defining, especially how the Academy/training worked. Romance appeared, often clumsily. 
 Still, The Cadet of Tildor was good. It's a debut novel, so I can only hope that Alex Lidell will improve. The basis is already there for an expanded, interesting world. I think it got better as the book went on, which definitely bodes well. It's not at Tamora Pierce-levels yet: it needs more nuance, character- and world-building, but overall it was good, and I look forward to seeing what Lidell writes in the future."
4,"Review posted at Under the Covers Book Blog 
 And it just keeps reeling me in, further and further... 
 So, here we are in episode 3 of the Flesh Cartel, Choices. In this episode, we see what happens immediately after the Auction. As per Nikolai's instructions, Dougie is put into complete isolation, in total darkness, and is completely sensory deprived for days on end. Mat, on the other hand, is provided with some more luxuries, like food and a bed, but is still tortured to hell and back and back again. I'm not really sure which one is worse. For Mat, it really doesn't look like there is an end in sight at all...not that what the reader has learned about his apparent future would lead one to think there will ever be an end to his sadistic treatment. But ever the eternal optimist, I hold out my hope. 
 As with the previous episodes, the cruelty and torture pervade and endure. And as disgusted as I still get (thankfully, I'm not desensitized yet), I cannot stop reading. In this episode, Haimowitz and Belleau provide the reader with such interesting insight to Nikolai, the brothers' buyer and ""trainer."" He is such a fascinating dichotomy. He has to be cruel to Mat so as to prepare him for his ultimate master. And yet for Dougie, he has taken such a liking to him and sees such a perfect sub in him, that he provides him with care and, dare I say it, loving gestures. And while all of his actions are egoistic and self-serving, we see that he WANTS to be caring and tender to Dougie. While part of me wants to like him for those tidbits of kindness, another part of me wants to hate him for his manipulations. 
 Added to the paradox that is Nikolai, we see in individual exchanges with both Mat and Dougie the he provides them with ""choices."" He lets them know that they have a choice in how things will happen, and he gives them this breadcrumb of hope that they will actually have some say and control in their lives. He tells them that he won't force them to do things that they don't want to do. However, those ""choices"" come with consequences. If they choose wisely, the consequences can be great. If they choose poorly, the consequences can be equally as tortuous as anything they've experienced previously, albeit in different ways. So, really, what choices do they have? As we got a glimpse of some of the brothers' choices once in Nikolai's care, we also saw some consequences. It appears that there will more of the same in the next episode, ""Consequences,"" and here is another reader waiting on the edge of my seat for its release.

4,"I liked this one even better than the first. The fight scenes were terrific, the plot actually moved along and I felt there was less of the building of the ancient history, which is a plus. Still, super long but really good if you are listening while you walk."
5,"I originally learned of this book after having read The Hunger Games . Most reviews I read said that THG was ripped off of this book, but after reading it, I have to disagree. The general concept of having a group of kids fighting to the death was the same but everything else was vastly different. I loved THG when I read it, but after reading this, I can't help but feel that THG was fluff in comparison. The only thing that I didn't like was that you could tell quality writing had been lost in translation. It was a bit annoying, but you can hardly blame the author for that. I'm so glad I got to finally read this book!!"
3,"Shakespeare plays are always a little difficult. I enjoyed this play because it was cute and quaint between the two couples. However, it was also a little sad because of the way Shylock was treated. He pretty much got the shaft from the start of the play. My understanding is still a little cloudy, but I'm glad I read the play :)"
3,"I liked the overall plot, but it moved kind of slowly for me. I ended up skimming a lot of it."
0,As always I can count on Lynsay Sands for something fun and cute. Great addition to the series.
4,"First read: Sep 30, 2010

4,"Pretty good, but I couldn't help envisioning this as a gender swap Harry Potter with the characters (dark hair and red hair vs snobby blonde who doesn't think the ""poor kids"" should be there), and the castle-school with mysterious forest setting. It couldn't be helped but it's not necessarily a bad thing either."
5,Highly recommend the audiobook version
2,I feel like this is a cheap imitation of Book 1.
5,"Simple Jess is a simple love story. People tend to think of simple things as unworthy. Not the case at all. In a world where everything is complicated, murky, and it's hard to tell what is real and what isn't, the simple gets taken for granted. Kind of like Jesse Best.

 I am a person who puts a lot of importance in education and in using your brain. I can blame that in part on my upbringing, but not completely. I have internalized that message way too much. I think that this book was therapeutic for me. In the rat race of life, I often forget to value what there is in my life that is free from elaboration, unconditional, without guile, fundamental. I put too much importance in achieving, only to feel bereft when those things fail to deliver. At the end of the day, I can still be loved, even if I am not the MVP at my job, don't have millions of dollars in the bank, listed as a MENSA member, or on Maxim's Hot 100 or People's most beautiful list. 
 Jesse is the reminder of the steadfast things in life. The pure items of worth and beauty that seem diminished when we look in the horizon and see the greener grass that doesn't belong to us. His heart is full of love. He's a man who can be trusted to do what he promises. His ability to forgive is not based on his lack of intelligence but in the strength of his loving heart. When Althea needed help he gave it to her, asking for very little in return. And Althea saw that what Jesse lacked was much less than what he possessed. 
 Althea thought being alone and independent was better than relying on anyone else. She'd always felt like the unwanted addition since her father left her and went off to remarry another woman. She was the spare relative that had to prove she was worthy of being around. She didn't want that feeling for her son, and she jealously guarded him, afraid to allow anyone else to influence him. But Jesse showed her that it was okay to trust in someone else, with her son and with everything that was truly of value. It took the kind words of Granny Piggott to get her to see that we need people, even those people who are the hardest to deal with. 
 I thought about the strange magic that is love. Our tendency to believe that our soulmate will come in a certain package or a specific way. That is if we even believe that love is possible for us. But God has other plans for us. I feel that in this story he was telling me that he gives beauty for ashes. Even though Jess was born diminished, and many folks took every opportunity to remind him of that, he had been given much in return for what he lacked. And that was more than enough to see him safe, loved, and content, and a blessing to others in his life. Another reminder to me that being content is the goal. Appreciating what seems merely adequate, when beneath or through a different set of glasses is pure riches. 
 I appreciate the simple beauty of this story. In the simplicity, I found true richness of storytelling and a resonance on an emotional level that makes me smile as I type the final words of this review."
4,This was a nice sequel to Good Bones. I like Dylan and Chris as a couple and was glad to see they got their happy ever after. The only issue I had was it was a bit on the slow side.
3,review coming
5,So. Many. Liars. Which I loved! Especially a female protagonist who is totally down for betraying the boy she loves. Definitely checking out the next one in this series.
5,"I adored this book! I loved the first book this duo wrote together, The Knockoff, and I thought this was a great second venture! The writing was witty and outlandish with just the perfect amount of realism thrown in to how how absurd the fitness craze can be. As a New Yorker, I can vouch that most of the ""trendy"" workouts in the book are based on fact, and that in this case the truth might be even stranger than fiction! 
 I completely sympathized with the protagonist and I loved her journey! A wonderful summer read! 
 *fyi, I got this one from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review :)"
2,"This book was OK. The story could have been so much more adventurous had it been told by a different narrator. By the middle I grew accustomed to the slow pace and narrow world of the family. However if something as momentous as an asteroid knocking the moon off-kilter happens, I'm going to want to know a lot more about its impact rather than the limited worldview that Miranda's teen diary can offer."
4,"Maggie has grown up, home-schooled no less, in a house full of guys. After her mother left, it's just been her, her older brothers and their father. Starting high school means leaving the safety and comfort of her home-schooled life. Maggie will have to make new friends that aren't family members, all while finding out who the mysteriously sad spirit is that follows her around. 
 A fairly simple story, with a spooky element is exactly what Friends with Boys is all about. The characters are full of personality and the writing is vivacious. Maggie's new friend Lucy is just about the most hilariously written character in this novel, with her over-the-top antics and mannerisms. All this doesn't even begin to describe the great layout and illustration of the graphic novel. I loved the intricate panels that were interspersed with more simple, minimal ones. One page would have full detail on all the background and scenery, clothing, everything while the very next will be a fully blank page but for one key picture. I love that kind of juxtaposition. There were so many great moments in these illustrated pages, some that actually caused me to laugh out loud. The style and banter reminded me a bit of Bryan Lee O'Malley's successful Scott Pilgrim series and fans of graphic novels are sure to enjoy! 
 This came highly recommended by a fellow blogger, and it definitely was as delightful a read as she said it would be! I have always been a big fan of comic books and graphic novels, but this is the first I've reviewed on this blog - and certainly won't be the last. Friends with Boys is a fantastically fun contemporary read, with a ghostly twist! 
 Rating: (4/5 stars)"
5,"Oh Charlotte, you bloody beautiful little spider. She is kind, she is brave, she is thoughtful, she is clever, and she doesn't take any shit from anybody. 
 This is one of my absolute all-time favourite books. I knew that I loved it. I knew that it was sad. Until I re-read it to my daughter though, I had forgotten how much I loved it, why it was such a beautiful book, and just how sad it really is. 
 I honestly think this is one of the most beautiful books ever written. For me, it is perfect. It's descriptive & evocative, without being over done (I'm looking at you, Tolkien). I was there. I was on the farm. I could see the barn, I could smell the animals. I could watch the seasons change. It is about friendship, love & sacrifice, but not presented in an overly saccharine sweet way. There are so many incredibly beautiful passages, but the one that I love the most, and that moves me the most would have to be: 
 (view spoiler)[""She never moved again. The next day, as the Ferris wheel was being taken apart and the race horses were being loaded into vans and the entertainers were packing up their belongings and driving away in their trailers, Charlotte died. The Fair Grounds were soon deserted. The shed and buildings were empty and forlorn. The infield was littered with bottles and trash. Nobody, of the hundreds of people that had visited the Fair, knew that a grey spider had played the most important part of all. No one was with her when she died."" 
 I mean, Jesus Christ, seriously ... what a paragraph. It is absolutely heartbreaking. (hide spoiler)] 
 I'm so glad I got to share this with my Charlotte. We just had a little big cry together, which to me shows just how special this book is, and just how well written it is, that it can affect both a child & an adult. E.B White, you da man."
1,The synopsis sounds good but the writing is terrible. I couldn't get pass chapter 3 :'<
5,"So much potential in this book. I don't understand why Stephenie Meyer isn't continuing the sequels and it's been 8 years since this was published. I love Twilight Saga but this is better and I'm not kidding. I have watched the movie first without any idea of the story and I really enjoyed it but my reading experience was incredible. 
 ""Souls"" are parasitic like aliens invading the humans on Earth making them as their host. These souls lived for thousands of years and have taken over many living things but humans are challenging because some of them are resistant to be inhabited. With a surgical procedure, these parasites were put in their hosts and they gain access on their memories. It's their decision to adapt their host's memories or erase them completely and make a new identity for themselves. Mostly, they erase them and it's like killing their souls but the body remains alive. The concept is fascinating, unique and intriguing. Despite of the slow pacing, everything in this book is intricate. 
 Our main characters are Wanderer/Wanda, a soul and Melanie Stryder, a human. Wanderer occupies Melanie's body but Melanie's memory is strong and vivid and her presence makes it difficult for her to fully take over. These two communicated through the mind and somehow shared a bond. Wanderer is a special soul. She's humble, selfless and caring. While Melanie is a courageous, tough and bold woman. These two were different in some ways but they are both complex and I love them equally as heroines. They helped each other to find Jared Howe, Melanie's boyfriend and Jamie, Melanie's younger brother and locate Jeb's hideout (Melanie's uncle) which is an enormous cave. 
 There are other humans in the cave and they are against Wanda to live with them. It took time before they got used to her and assured that she's not going to expose them to Seekers. Wanda adapted to human ways and she really appreciate their acceptance to her. She works hard and even it's dangerous, she helps on raids later on. The romance in this book is fascinating. It is a love triangle (but not really) and it's well done.You don't know how torn I am between Ian O'Shea and Jared Howe. Goodness gracious, Jared is more of a bad boy than Ian. You know how I love bad boys but how can I resist Ian? He's so sweet, protective and gentle. I can't decide who I want. With Max Irons and Jake Abel portraying them? Perfect! Especially Max Irons ASDFGHJKL ;) 
 Seriously, I am hoping Stephenie Meyer will continue writing the sequels. My waiting game is ON...forever."
4,"""Freedom...Its other name is Choosing."" 
 Abduction and Apocalypse - a story of ""survival, resilience, and hope."" 
 First off, this novel has little to no similarity to either ROOM or to THE LOVELY BONES. To compare them is to do all of the very different stories an injustice. Start with an open mind. 
 Blythe is just 16 years old when she is kidnapped and taken down below ground into an abandoned missile silo in Kansas by a disaster survivalist who has created an impenetrable bunker deep in the bowels of the earth. Dobbs Hordin met Blythe when he was working in the Eudora high school library and abducts her while she is walking home from a town celebration. He's completely convinced that armegedon is imminent and has made complex and complicated plans for survival and for propagating the species afterwards. The first part of the book deals with Blythe's life while imprisoned in the silo. Every day and each event that Blythe endures in the dark and stale compartments below the Kansas plain is one of self-sacrifice and infused with desperation for freedom and return to the family and life she knew before. Dobbs makes frequent missions outside of their compound and returns with supplies and news -- but he is not to be trusted so Blythe has no way to know what is really going on in the world above. Blythe struggles as she is first required to be Dobbs's mate and then to raise a child. She tries to stay alive and mentally intact through her memories but all she can think of is getting OUT. 
 That day of emancipation comes after 17 years in captivity and what she finds when she and Adam open the doors of the silo is not at all what she had prayed for, hoped for, or imagined it would be. The last parts of the book deal with Blythe and Adam as they come face to face with a changed world and try to reconcile all that happened and forge a new existence. To discover that to live might just take more than to survive the worst. 
 The book is set in current day but sometimes the character of Blythe didn't ring true when compared to teenagers I know -- she seemed much more old-fashioned -- which was sort of off putting. There are serious religious overtones at times in the writing, though the apocalypse isn't suggested to be a punishment, but definitely it is has heavy social commentary. Sometimes the internal dialog that Blythe has with herself seems a stream of consciousness blathering that occasionally went on too long and the reader indeed gets the message that this is not the world whose memories kept Blythe going and to which she wanted to return. Yes, there were deaths and changes. Many stereotypical characters that will be recognized by anyone who reads post-apocalyptic fiction -- the good guys and the bad guys. 
 Overall, I enjoyed the story. I think it's one that all ages will devour -- it would make a great movie! Lots of good points for discussion in a book club and I'm definitely going to recommend it to young adult readers as well. I'd love to have a paper format to get one of the teens to review. 
 Thank you to NetGalley and Gallery, Threshold, Pocket Books for the ARC e-book to review."
4,"I was up till 3am reading..... couldn't put it down.... Just kept flipping pages, needing to get to the end. I had tons of guesses as to the twists in this book, but they were all wrong, and I love when that happens! Lots of lust in this book....yes LUST! Some very hot sex scenes! If it didn't end the way it did, I think I would have been devastated! Great job Ella.... love to read something diffrrent that keeps me guessing!"
4,"Almost as good as the first one. I really liked the contrast between Tibby's and Lena's sexual experiences, as well as Carmen's inability to fathom her ""friendship"" with Julia. It being the last book in the series, it was nice to see everything wrapped up nicely but not too neatly."
4,I enjoyed the story a lot but felt like there were still a lot of loose ends. Definitely didn't like it as much as The Heir. Full review on AnotherRamble.com soon!
4,"""With what I did yesterday, I should be dead: zapped by the chip they put in my brain when I was Slated."" 
 A sequel that packs just as much punch as its predecessor, Fractured does not disappoint! 
 Fractured picks up where Slated left off. As wisps of Kyla's memories start coming back to her she struggles with her identity; between who she is now, who she was before being Slated, and her younger self. 
 One of the many things that grabbed me about Fractured was Terry's simplistic yet engaging writing style: 
 ""Rain has many uses. 
 Holly and beech trees like those around me need it to live and grow. 
 It washes away tracks, obscures footprints. Makes trails harder to follow, and that is a good thing today. 
 But most of all, it washes blood from my skin, my clothes."" 
 Terry also has a way with characters, and as much as I want to discuss these complex, multi-layered characters that are not at all what they first appear to be I won't. I think it's best to go into this book unknowing, trying to figure these characters out for yourself and maybe being surprised by what you find, like I was. I will, however, mention Nico, a dark and charismatic character who we were introduced to at the end of book one. I admit to being drawn in by this mysterious young man from Kyla's past, I was hoping he would get more page time in the sequel and he certainty did. Nico is the kind of character who can change in an instant, one minute he'll be smiling, comforting Kyla and the next he's stone-cold, getting straight down to business. It was so much fun unraveling this him, and finding out just what his true motives were. 
 There wasn't much action in the first book, so I thought there would some be in the sequel. And to a certain extent there was, especially towards the end, but there wasn't quite as much as I initially thought there would be. And you know what? I was surprised to find that I didn't care, this is a thriller that doesn't need action to be engrossing. I found myself flying through Fractured, excited when revelations came to light, heart broken when *insert spoiler here*, shocked when *insert spoiler here*, and hopeful when *you get the picture*! 
 I can't wait to read the third and final book in the trilogy, hurry up Spring 2014! 
 This review also appears on my blog, The Page Turner."
2,"Although I haven't read any of Cassandra Clare's novels, the fact that Jaclyn Dolamore's Dark Metropolis was compared to her books meant that I had pretty high expectations for it. For a multitude of reasons however, I ended up being disappointed by Dark Metropolis. Firstly, while reading the book, it was hard for me to get into a rhythm because it kept switching perspectives between different characters, all of whom I found rather dull. On top of that, Dark Metropolis then featured two bland romances, - one heterosexual, one homosexual, - both of which were insta-loves. Finally, I found the worldbuilding to be pretty vague as many things were either explained only briefly or alluded to."
5,"I tried. 
 I really, really tried to make this one last as much as possible. 
 All in all, it was a valiant effort. But the last few chapters were like a dam breaking over my flimsy reading blockades, and I gave into gobbling up every chapter like there was no tomorrow. 
 Which, for some of the characters, ended up being true. 
 Assorted Musings Time, brought to you by the Expanse Saga! 
 (view spoiler)[ 
 - I think this entry may be the first one where the last conflict isn't resolved in a huge action sequence. The one conflict before last is solved that way, though. And gotta be grateful for it, because the action sequences written by this writers' duo are top-notch as usual. 
 - With that said, the final conflict ended up being a little bit anti-climatic. Just a little bit, though. Because it was solved by the power of mysterious science, analytical skills and Naomi Nagata, all three pluses in my view. 
 - You get a POV! And you get a POV! And you get a POV! Seriously, this entry may also boast the largest amount of diverse point-of-view chapters in all of them. Even Prax (kind of randomly tangential as his chapters ended up being...) makes an appearance. And a trio of Belters. And a random couple of Earthers. And the Rocinante crew (all of them, even their most recent additions). And Avassarala. And the big bad. And his son. And the Butcher. And Anderson Dawes. And... I think that may be all? 
 - Am I the only one worried that Marco may return bigger, badder and however the Ring may decide to return him? Or is he gone, pulverized for good? 
 - Am I also the only one worried about Duarte's escapades at Laconia? Judging by the short novella immediately previous to this entry, he is certainly up to no good (of course he is). 
 - Oh Fillip, you insufferable little twat. I did enjoy when your wide shut eyes finally got opened, though. 
 - Needs more Amos. And Clarissa as well, now. But Bobbie's awesome and deserves her spotlight, so it kinda all evens out. 
 - I still miss Miller. 
 (hide spoiler)] 
 So... when's the next one out? ""Three more"", you say? Terrific!"
3,"I wanted to love it, but I just couldn't. The lack of explanations just killed it for me. This book had no setting, though I'm assuming it's China. But it's never mentioned, and to me that's a pretty fundamental aspect of a book. The plot was really quite cool and exciting once you got more into the book, but it took me forever to get there because it was pretty slow and I kept having to reread things to try and understand what was going on. Not sure if I'll end up picking up book 2."
4,"Even though I found the mystery pretty obvious, I still really like the story. The characters are believable in their circumstances, and likable. The story ends well, and I can't wait to read the squeal."
4,"Just as good as the first two. SPOILER ALERT COMING UP: 
 But why did Finnick have to die? :("
5,Feels everywhere. Oh and I totally called the ending.
4,"I never know how to rate Katie McGarry novels. A lot of people swear by them, but for me they come off a little too angsty. There is A LOT going on all the time - misunderstandings, etc, and I just want the characters to catch a break. Although the main showdown was a bit of a, er, let-down and then the TWIST? I don't completely understand why that had to happen. 
 However, the characters in this one were the most loveable, I think. I'm surprised how quickly Isaiah realised his feelings, I thought that part would be dragged out because of Beth. It is definitely a favourite of the three novels I've read so far. 
 Also, sidenote, Abby! I want her story - is that coming maybe?"
4,This book was hard to take in. Painful and of course beautiful in its way.
2,"I was pretty excited about The Miniaturist when I was approved for it. It's received a lot of good reviews, good press, and a lot of buzz around the publishing squabbles over it, and it's had comparisons to a lot of books I have enjoyed, including Sarah Waters' work. Unfortunately, I really didn't get into it. My only real interest was the story of the little miniature house: the bits of mystery and so on actually just... got on my nerves, really. That's why I took so long to review it -- that feeling that I wasn't 'getting' the hype. 
 It's not egregiously bad in any way I could put my finger on. I can see why the comparisons to Sarah Waters, etc. The writing is fine, and flows reasonably well. It's not a bad idea for a story, though it perhaps doesn't fit together the way I'd like. All in all, I'm just... underwhelmed. Sorry!"
4,"Hushed is the story of sad and broken boy, Archer. As her best friend, Archer promises Vivian that he will get back at all the guys who physically and mentally screwed her. He was witness to the sexual abuse inflicted upon Vivian by her brother's gang of friends and the way in which his dad maltreated his mother. That's when Archer decides to make a list of 'to kill' people and sets his mind on finishing once and for all what he couldn't put an end to. He becomes a monster and his only chance of surviving in the mess that he has created is Evan. 
 Throughout the book, I had a love-hate relationship with Archer. There were times when I wanted to slap him and there were time when I wanted to whisper in his ear that everything will be alright. His life is so screwed up that fixing it becomes a daunting task. Some of his actions were justifiable, while others seemed too spontaneous and too hard. He took too much on himself. He could have done better but he managed to do his best and he is a good guy which is all that matters. 
 Vivian was an absolute mess. I couldn't understand her and I couldn't relate to her. She was crazy and didn't know what she doing. She made Archer suffer so much. She meant everything to him and she only went to him when she needed him. It is understandable that she lost her brother and mom and was depressed, but she took crazy to a whole new level with her drama. The way she takes revenge against Archer was cruel. 
 The most amazing character in Hushed is Evan. He asks Archer for help in finding the school principal's office and the two eventually start hanging out. Author Kelley York explains the way in which Archer and Evan's relationship evolves in a very beautiful manner. Evan is the perfect, normal and clean balance to Archer's disgust, guilt and burdens. He is always there for Archer giving him his space at the same time. The romantic scenes between the two were so beautiful. I was so happy to read that they both make each other happy and they share a beautiful relationship. There was a scene where Archer is finding it hard to put a name to how Evan smells. He comes up with hope, if even there is such a scent. Evan smells of hope to Archer. How beautiful is that! The scene where Evan's sister sort of claims to like girls more than guys just to make their parents more comfortable about Evan and Archer was so sweet. Evan's family scenes and any scenes with Evan in them bought a normal and relaxed touch to the general tensed atmosphere of the book. 
 Archer's relations with his mother and Vivian's mother were also beautiful in their own way. I loved how close he was to Viv's mom, how much he cared about her, how much she meant to him and how she was more a mother to him than his own mother. 
 I do wish that the physical appearances of the main characters at least were more elaborated. I couldn't picture the guy on the cover as Archer (he looks so good, in case you hadn't already noticed!). I kept imagining Viv with dark hair when she actually had blonde hair. 
 Hushed is all about falling apart, breaking into a million pieces, picking those pieces up and emerging as a new person. It has a dark, depressing and disturbing edge to it. Kelley York's writing is simple, systematic and precise. Just like I did with Archer, I have a love-hate relationship with the book. I didn't like Hushed. No wait. I liked Hushed. Yes, I really liked Hushed. I don't have a concrete feeling about the book in my head, but I can say that Hushed was a beautiful and emotionally powerful read that I highly recommend."
3,"I always get intrigued by a ""virtual world"" setting and I truly believe this might be in our future someday. A lot of the games I like to play focus on world-building, kind of like Sim City. I thought it was pretty cool that Durango had a character like Nixy who made a living out of bringing kids back out from the MEEP into the real world. I was also very intrigued with the conspiracy theory and how that would play out. Unfortunately, things weren't as fleshed out or as dangerous as I was hoping and the book as a whole fell kind of flat for me. I could quickly and easily tell who was behind Wyn's kidnapping and it wasn't all that diabolical, to be honest. 
 My favorite part of the book was when Nixy went into Wyn's world. She had to face quite a few obstacles before she could get there and I loved it. It was unpredictable, action-packed, and engaging. You get ferocious animals, creepy creatures, and so much more. It was kind of what I was expecting more of the book would be about. For a book centered around virtual reality, I wanted more of that creativeness and limitless imagination that I associate with this theme. Anyways, I loved how each obstacle tested Nixy in various ways and I loved seeing how she handled it all, physically and mentally. She made me laugh a lot throughout the book, but this was where I liked her the most. 
 I also really liked Nixy's relationship with her parents. They're actually part of the coding team who run the MEEP, her dad helping to create the worlds itself and her mom working on the verbal coding that the characters actually say. It was pretty cool. They were definitely a fun and cute little family and even though we don't get much of them, I really liked what I did get. 
 I could've done without the romance and I honestly didn't care for it at all. It was kind of like they were working towards a good friendship with a mutual understanding and then suddenly it jumped right into the romance between Nixy and Wyn. There are setbacks which stop the relationship from progressing and giving it more of a chance to develop, but by then I was already turned off from it so it felt more like an aside to me. It didn't add anything to the overall storyline and just felt like it was placed there because ""every book needs a romance of sorts"". 
 So yes, The Leveller isn't as action-packed or exciting as I hoped it would be. There were definitely good parts and I liked Nixy overall. She's pretty snarky and confident, and I liked being in her head. But, the story kind of fizzles out and it ends up being kind of boring towards the end."
4,"If you haven't read this series, you are missing it big time. One of my favorites from all time. 
 Qhuinn has suffered from lack of acceptance from his family, just because he isn't perfect. Having eyes with different colors really suck in this world. Luckily, the Brothers don't care. They believe he is a great fighter and a man of worth. (If my Z likes him, I like him). 
 Qhuinn is in love. But the love is not returned or so he thinks. He believe his soulmate is happy with his boyfriend Saxton. It's tough for Blay and Qhuinn to open up to each other and so many misunderstandings occurred. Their relationship has to bloom in between all the lesser and Xcor's continuous attacks to the Brotherhood. 
 Qhuinn and Layla are happy about her pregnancy but things never do go as planed. 
 I love Payne in this one (and she has never been one of my favorite characters). I feel bad for Xcor and his love for Layla. I love Assail and can't wait to see his story with Sola. Sola is tough as nails and she doesn't give up. She'll be a great addition to the other Shellans. Trez and iAm as shadows are interesting but I gotta admit I like Assail better. 
 We have the little plot against our King Wrath. I'm pretty sure this is only the beginning of his problems (specially since Beth really wants a baby). 
 You know what a missed more: the interaction within the Brothers and their Shellans. My Z has some page action but I wanted more. I really miss all of them. 
 Can't wait for the next one.

3,"3.5 stars 
 I better liked Beautiful Bastard. There was just something missing- a spark or something, can't put my finger on it... maybe I'm just not ""into"" what the book was all about"
5,"This book was a delight to read, especially this time of year with Halloween right around the corner! Halloween is my favorite holiday and now that I am past my months-long reading slump (huzzah!), I knew I was ready for a good, captivating, and spooky book to get me into the spirit of the season and boy did I ever pick a good one! The Monstrumologist was not only a spooky story, it was also an engaging tale of the human condition. I savored this book right down to the last page. Yancey has a gift for keeping his reader entertained through the entire ride. There was so much about this book that I liked but most of all I loved how flippin' gory it was! There was monster blood and pus and flesh eating and severed limbs and all of my favorite things! At times it was increasingly difficult to believe that this was a book aimed at young adult bibliophiles! This is because of the gore, yes, but more so of Yancey's elaborate yet eloquent, writing style. The novel is set in 1888 and much of the language and verbiage of the book reads as a novel of this era would. I feel like it could be over the heads of younger readers and would hesitate to recommend it to anyone in their early teens (and younger, of course). 
 I am not one to be easily scared by a book, especially a book about monsters. Ghosts? Yes. Demons? Oh hell yes. Monsters? Not so much. That being said, this book really spooked me out! I attribute this fact to Yancey's uncanny ability to world-build. The setting was very believable and realistic. If you are good at suspending your disbelief while reading, like I am, then you can really find yourself believing that monsters do exist! 
 The only complaint that I could have about this book is that it was a tad bit too long for me. I thought that some of the scenes were a little overdone and that maybe 50 or so pages could possibly have been shaved off. This is only book one of a trilogy and I am very excited to read the rest of this series! The next book is The Curse of the Wendigo which excites me more than the Anthropophagi that we were dealing with in this book; I'm a little more familiar with Wendigos from my days of Charmed watching! (The season one episode The Wendigo is my favorite episode of the entire series!) 
 If you are looking for a super spooky Halloween read then I can't recommend this one enough!"
3,"Giving this book 3 stars makes me feel like I have no class. Certainly, this book deserves a higher rating. But although I appreciated the novel for its meticulous research, daring plot, and unusual narration, it just did not capture my heart. 
 I'm heartless along with having no class! 
 The story opens bleakly, with our narrator captured by the Gestapo. We are reading her written ""confession"" as it were. She spins a tale of two young women -- one is from Manchester, the other is a Scottish noble. Maddie and Queenie meet during the war effort in 1936, on an air base. The two quickly become friends, but are separated as they take different paths. Then, they are thrown together again unexpectedly, as both are needed for a top secret mission in France. 
 I'm not entirely sure why this book was marketed as YA. Although the ages of these women are never discussed, they're certainly not teenagers. The only reason I can think of is that the book has a less mature tone. This sounds bad, I know. What I mean is, I found the premise to be slightly implausible. Certainly women took on a more significant role in the war effort during World War II, but I found the story of Maddie and Queenie to be such that is only possible in fiction. It's the kind of wish fulfillment frequently found in YA literature. 
 One thing is undeniable, however -- the book is incredibly well researched. So much so that there's a bibliography at the end of the book. The detail is superb; the voice is solidly of the period. It was extremely impressive. That being said, I did think that the language was at times overly clogged with this period detail. This made my progress through Code Name Verity somewhat labored. 
 Another aspect that disappointed me -- I can't seem to stop myself -- was the friendship between Maddie and Queenie. I guess I was expecting more chemistry. But, apart from the fantastic early stage of their relationship, the reader doesn't get to experience the two together so much. This was a bit of a letdown, since I was looking forward to reading about a solid friendship. 
 All of this is to say that I expected more from the book than I experienced. Somehow, though, I feel more disappointed in myself than in the book."
3,"3.7 
 Don Quixote is a story about a knight in the shinning armor in a world where there is no more knights in shining armors, well more like a middle aged man who have gone mad from reading too much about knights in shinning armors and decides to go on adventures to establish peace and justice, he's crazy, wise, innocent, idealist, pure hearted and puzzling, but he doesn't lose his sense of morals and chivalric concepts of right and wrong throughout his crazed visions. Don Quixote's resolve to live up to his dreams or rather illusions is inspiring, he refuses to live unhappily in a world he no longer accepts. It's a long book, but funny and insightful somehow, i enjoyed it."
5,"I really enjoyed reading about Elena and Raphael and could not wait for Nalini to get back to them after the 2 Guild Hunter books without them. I honestly had no want to read books 4 or 5 and was a little worried that I would be lost when I jumped back in for ARCHANGEL'S LEGION, but I am happy to report that I felt like I had not left the series at all. 
 A surprising amount of events and confrontations happen in ARCHANGEL'S LEGION and it's all written so smoothly that before you know it the book is at its end and you are pining for more. We get Angel's falling from the sky, woman throwing themselves at Raphael (although that is nothing new), Mother in Law drama, father drama and a supernatural war that you will not soon forget. 
 I love the development of Raphael and Elena's relationship. They have gone through a lot and they closer and closer every day and with every event. They both complement each other really well and I love watching them together. Elena handles the woman coming after Raphael surprisingly well and I can not help but laugh thinking of anyone brave enough to come after their relationship in the future. Raphael's Mom surprised me, I enjoyed her more than I thought I would after certain events. I understand Elena's Father better after ARCHANGEL'S LEGION. It will never excuse his behavior but I understand him now. The author brings out a lot of emotions in this installment you will be laughing, cringing, crying and yelling with the rest of us when you dive in. 
 The fight at the end, CRAZY! I was gripped to my seat with my heart pounding out of my chest while reading and I never thought it would end like it did. Why must we wait to get more? Will book 7 stay with Raphael and Elena? I really really hope so."
3,"At the end of the book I was able to guess the very end, but otherwise I didn't have a clue as to how the murder would be resolved. It's your typical Agatha Christie murder mystery."
3,"** spoiler alert ** 
 An entire family vanishes in a well-secured home. One would wonder: was it burglary? But why were piles of expensive jewelry left in the kitchen? 
 A former cop who is linked with the house owner's construction company goes on the case to see what she can do. If this hadn't to do with money then could the motive be personal and as harsh as the truth can get? 
 Time is limited and lives are in danger as no one seems to be innocent either in the web of complications or in the life of their own individual turmoil. 
 I am torn with this book! Yes, it features interesting characters and a story with many turns and twists but I couldn't help but wonder why the main character's introduction was so vague (it seemed to translate to ""Read the first book to find out what went on!""). 
 Plus the two perspectives within were easy to get used to (first person to an omnipresent-third) and I thought it was interesting that a family that is going through such a spirit-breaking situation was already torn by their own intricate lives shattered by a life-changing event. 
 One thing I could not get over was a key character. Yes he seemed like someone who was trying to make things better because he made a huge error but he was pretty much a dirt-bag type of character and because of that I ended up seeing a twist coming not too far near that realization. 
 I liked some of the characters, the point of view writing was good. Near the end it pretty much close to made me not like it as much. It had great points but overall it was an okay thriller."
2,"I mostly hate this book. 
 The main characters are just awful people. Completed self-absorbed and reckless, even for two high school students, it's too much. 
 There truly isn't really any plot, and I think that was Daniel Handler's intention, but I hate that the most about this book. This book could have been really useful for young readers, especially in the parts of the book that touch upon consent, and yet because it seems to have been written strictly for shock value, I think it falls so far from having any substance. 
 This book is much too racy to purchase for my classroom library, so it will never see the light of day in my student's hands unless they obtain a copy on their own. I do think students would read it, merely because it is so explicitly shocking, but there's not much for them to take away from it, so it won't be missed."
5,"A very satisfying conclusion to one of my favourite YA dystopia trilogies. Epic battles, continued struggle for survival, more revelations about the backstory of the world Deuce and her friends live in, strong character development, plot twists, interesting new additions to the cast of characters, big emotions and of course some casualties along the way. An intense finale that had me alternately breathless, in tears or with a huge smile on my face the entire time. Loved the epilogue as well."
1,"dear lord, patterson, just let these characters/this world/these tired storylines out of their misery."
4,"The latest Temeraire does not disappoint. While I would have liked to learn more about the Australian parallel-evolution versions of dragons, the book was engaging in itself and sets up all sorts of interesting adventures to come. It's fascinating to watch history diverge as the series goes on."
3,"This the story of a girl whose nickname is Beauty and how her family falls from wealth and how she is forced to join the Beast. 
 I was really expecting to like this book, I like retellings of story tales. But this one just felt to easy, everything just seemed to workout to easy for my tastes. But over all not a bad book, just not to my taste, I give it 2.5 stars."
5,"I loved this book, they are flawed and at times very funny and I did want to bang their heads together but I couldn't help fall in love with Mark and Quin. I am a fan of Ty and Zane from Abigail Roux's cut and run series now the have serious competition in Mark and Quinton for top alpha male couple I wonder if they would be friends??

5,"i can't remember the last time i related so much with a pov character. i guess it comes with a tumblr girl writing about a tumblr character. in any case, bravo, miss oseman. this was one hell of a ride and i couldn't be more in love with this book. just beware: this is a book more about the characters than it is about the plot, which is definitely my sort of thing but isn't everyone else's."
4,This book asks for a decent investment of time but it pays off pretty well. A sprawling narrative to say the least.
3,"I love this series, but I did not love this particular one in the series. I have to say it's my least favorite. There is not much I can say without giving away what is happening, but I will say this. Something really fantastic does happen and it's about damn time. Oberon still makes me LMAO. I still love Atticus and all the characters. I would never give up on the series. You should still read it. This is still one of the best series out there today."
2,"This book was, erm... interesting. 
 Yes, I liked it. But the writing annoyed the crap hell out of me. She repeats everything and strikes random bits out. At first I'm like, oh! She's striking out the treasonous bits! But then it continued and I'm like.... Okay... no wonder she's in a psychological hospital. 
 The romance was also way overdone. Here is something she says in a car. Withtwo other people in it. 
 ""I'm going to memorize every inch oof you with my lips."" 
 Did I mention that one of the other people was a ten year old? Cause it was. 
 Dear Tahereh Mafi: 
 Teenagers are eager and curious about sex, and do think about it alot. But usually not when their boyfriend is bleeding to death in the seat next to them. 
 Sincerely Audrey 
 Plus, the thing about him being the only one she could touch was a little... convenient. 
 Anyway, I still enjoyed the story bit. The writing and the teenaged horniness was a little too much to earn a four or five star rating."
5,"Wow, that ending. I feel genuinely horrible for every person who read this when it was released and had to wait a full year to find out what happens next! 
 Oh, and yes, I loved it. These books just keep getting better."
4,"reread 8/15- Still love it! Eddie and Jet are great together! 
 Original review 2/15 
 Another great romance from this author! I just love the humor and fun characters in these stories. I wish there had been epilogue because I needed a bit more closure, but I still really liked it."
4,"The book starts right were Divergent left off on the train. Things are pretty on edge now. The Erudite are not just threatening to the Dauntless but also the other factions. 
 I really wanted to love this book because I loved the first but really I couldn't love Tris. She has some problems ((view spoiler)[after killing her friend (hide spoiler)] for Divergent) but I thought Four would make up for it, he didn't. They have trust issues-both of them. But I liked that it was basically the relationship that was the problem, not some love triangle. I still think the relationship is going too fast but *shrug* there is nothing I can do about it. 
 What was different about this book was that there is still action and a whole lot of tension but this time Tris isn't just struggling with fitting into the Daughtless. Tris has inner struggles as well because of her guilt and she realizes how much her choices can change her and others around her. Now I may not have liked the way she went about dealing with it or even all the choices she made, but I could understand it. 
 I was hoping that there would be more background story on the society (such as why are there different factions?) but I know there is going to be more information in the next book. I'm a excited of course. I'm not sure these books are good for my health. Sometimes I can tell that my heart rate speeds up a little. So I've got to give it to Roth; she sure has me invested."
3,The only bad thing I have to say about the novel is that it's too short!!
5,"I'm not sure the last time I enjoyed a sci-if novel this much. I would even put it up there with Enders Game and the first two books in the Dragonriders of Pern series. 
 The book was utterly captivating and enthralling. It was mostly sci-fi with a dash of romance. The world building was fabulous, the characters were fantastic, and a wonderful endearing AI. 
 I was lucky to read both books within two days, yesterday and today's new release of Dark Deeds. Unfortunately now I'll have to wait like everyone else until the third book will be released."
5,"It's what I am and, if you want excuses, come and take them. 
 Apart from Throne of Glass, ACOTAR and the Shadowhunter books, I have never read an epic fantasy book so quickly. 
 This book was such a roller coaster. It was so bloody good, I loved it. It switches back between ten year old Jorg and thirteen year old Jorg, correct me if I'm wrong. He is the youngest son, I'm pretty sure, of the King of Ancrath. His mother and brother were killed by Count Renar and Jorg is ready to get revenge on Renar. But first, he must bring along his ""brothers,"" a band of fellow thieves, murderers and the like. There's sorcery, necromancy, raising the dead, walking skeletons, shadow magic, blood and gore, great dialogue. 
 And honestly that ending effed me UP. I am so shook by that ending and the small twist at the very end. Oh jeez I am going to have so much fun reading the rest of these books. 
 The writing is spectacular. Some may not get used to it but I personally loved how inspirational quotes are woven into the author's writing. It makes for such an enjoyable experience when you're reading the book. It makes it quick and fast, simple to read. It did take me only around 50 pages to get into the gist of the book but after that, I was flying through it. 
 One more thing I'd like to mention is that Jorg is basically the villain. Or an antihero. But still, he is so dark and mysterious and unpredictable. Literally right at the start he shanks someone I didn't think he'd shank. Wow dude, just wow. Although unpredictable, he does have his flaws and thorns. But he grows throughout the story and I love how realistic it is, plus his ambition to become King and Emperor? It's just amazing. 
 Right well now you know my love for this book so I'm just going to cry a dam and read book two now. 
 *screams, wails and tantrums bc certain character death*"
2,"I didn't have huge expectations when going into this book, but I thought it would just been like Wake; a fun, easy read to pass time. This was a massive disappointment though, it was boring with stupid characters making stupid decisions. Here's some things I didn't like: 
 Gemma 
 Ugh Gemma. What is it witth these YA characters who are given something amazing and just act like brats? At the end of Wake (view spoiler)[ she agrees to go with the sirens to keep her family safe. (hide spoiler)] throughout Lullaby all she does is complain about this and mope around. She constantly agrees to things then a paragraph later changes her mind. Yeah it's horrible she has to leave home and feed off people, but she's been given immortality and the chance to live an amazing life with three new sisters. (view spoiler)[ When she eventually does feed off someone, he turns out to be a rapist and she feels bad for him. (hide spoiler)] She has no choice but to feed or die herself, why wouldn't she just do as Thea does and only kill evil people? That would have been an interesting read and would have been a realistic choice. 
 Alex and Gemma's Relationship 
 Alex is probably the most boring character in the book, which is saying something. The relationship between the two is so forced, I'm pretty sure they go on one date and are suddenly in love? And the entire time Gemma is away she spends moping over a boy she's just started dating rather than say her dad or her mentally ill mother? They have no chemistry at all and I have no interest in them. 
 The Characterisation of the Sirens 
 Penn: beautiful= evil 
 Lexi: blonde, girly = stupid 
 *sigh* 
 The Plot 
 There was none. 
 I am being a bit harsh, I read this on the train on the way to college to pass time and if was good enough for that. Just don't get your hopes up for an action packed book about siren mythology or you'll be very diisappointed."
2,"2.5 stars 
 It was okay. I liked parts of it but the 1st half was too slow. Nothing happened, I found the 2nd half to be much better than the first. The first half was literally 
 The book was way too long! 
 I nearly abandoned this, the only reason I finished is that it was well written and the overall plot seemed interesting. At first I didn't really like Allie or Carter (or any of the characters to be honest) but they grew on me. I liked the mystery about night school and what it actually was. Also, the characters weren't what they seemed at first which I liked. The characters changed in the book and Allie improved a lot. She was so childish at first but she improved a lot but I still think that she can be a better character. None of the characters were that memorable and I didn't really connect with any of them. The ending left me 
 I think it was rushed and it could have been better. I was literally 
 Overall, while this isn't something I really enjoyed. I didn't hate it either. I liked parts of it and will read the next one to see what happens."
5,"""First impressions were typically correct. My first impressions were always correct. This was because I employed a very scientific approach to forming impressions and was born with infallible logic."" 
 Lol. This statement is very Cletus. 
 ""I only had time for twenty-four people (tops) in my life, and I already had six siblings. Twenty-four people was an average of two birthdays a month. That's a lot of cake, and I'm particular about my cake."" 
 Oh, Cletus, Cletus, Cletuuuuuuuuuuuus! You delectable, witty, intelligent, annoyingly conniving piece of man! Guys, I swear, Cletus may or may not be my favorite Winston brother (of course, everyone's my favorite, but for this year, I'm giving it to Cletus HAHA). 
 ""Wait. I'm wearing your shirt."" 
 ""I know,"" Cletus said, not looking at meas he popped open the driver's side door. ""I wanted to see what you'd look like wearing it."" 
 Beard Science was like the book equivalent of chocolate cake--sent from the heavens above! I think I was smiling all throughout the book, especially because of the dynamic between Cletus and Jennifer, and of course the delicious magic of the Winston brothers. Damn, those brothers make me want to scream my undying love for them. 
 Also, I super love Jennifer's character. She's definitely more than the mouth-watering banana cakes she creates. She's funny, compassionate, understanding, genuine, and most of all, has put Cletus in his place. 
 ""For example, when Rhea Mathis called me ""stranger than a vegeterian at a barbeque"" during choir practice at church, I decided it was her own special way of saying unique."" 
 Jennifer and Cletus together was so unconventionally perfect. A mix of different personalities, but a mix of epic proportions! GAH! I'm so in love with their love. 
 ""Every one of my muscles tensed, lucidity persisting and reminding me that I was in love with this woman. I loved her both rationally and irrationally. And I wanted her with a ferocity that had kept me awake at night and tortured during the day."" 
 Penny Reid has yet to fail me, and I just love her for delivering brilliance every. single. time! Can't wait for Beau's book! LIKE SERIOUSLY CAN'T WAIT. LIKE I NEED IT RIGHT NOW. LIKE I'M NOT EVEN KIDDING. 
 5 stars! 
 ""After cuddling for too short a time, I drove Jennifer home. I held her hand as we walked to the car. I held her hand while I drove. I held her hand as I walked her to her porch. And then I was forced to let go of her hand. 
 I'd had indigestion since. Not real indigestion; I was suffering from a type of heartburn caused by missing a person."""
5,John Green is without a doubt a genius.
2,"I think this story was thoroughly rushed. Things kept peeling off to fast in succession. It's just drama after drama! 
 *spoiler alert (kind of)*** 
 No one keeps their virginity that long just to give it up to prove a point. 
 And one minute this girl is sleeping and the next she has meningitis ... c'mon now! 
 Too fast with too much drama for me. But a read nonetheless. 
 *2.5 stars for me*"
5,"WOW! This definitely moves to the top of my Graphic Novel list. I'm excited that the library has all 8 volumes. Somebody has the next one checked out and it's way overdue. I hope they didn't lose it. 
 There's so much about Buddhism that I don't understand. I'm hoping to gain some insight from these."
1,"Very new concept: a vampire that can read everyone else's thoughts except the ones of the heroine. 
 Gosh, let me think where I've heard it before... 
 ***update 23/05/2015 - giving it another try since it's back in the monthly list of books to discuss in a group I'm in. 
 other very new concept: eyes of the vampire change color. 
 ** final : dropped it again. I managed to read another few chapters before being finally disgusted to the point of no return."
4,A disturbing story that lingers in your mind after you've finished the book.
5,"Miki! Miki! Miki! 
 That's what Miki's little geek friends shout when she comes around and I love her so much, I find myself shouting it with them. She's beyond genius, funny, witty, and could be crowned the queen of snark. She's the poster child for small but mighty because even though she's a human, she has a cunning creativity when it comes to her mean streak that scares the shit out of shifters. 
 How can you not love a woman who is without a filter, saying whatever comes to mind, no matter how inappropriate her thoughts or comments are. Her inquisitive mind is constantly in overdrive especially when it comes to this new to her world of shifters. This leads to constant questions and odd and usually inappropriate experiments. There's a reason the book is called Go Fetch, lol. 
 Now she's not the only reason Go Fetch is my favorite SL book. I love that she's paired up with the perfect wolf for her, Connal. Everyone thinks he's one great big teddy bear and the nice one of the bunch. Miki saw straight through that bullshit and knows he's the most terrifying of them all. The first time Connal saw little Miki it stopped him in his tracks, and come hell or high water he's going to catch her and make her his. Too bad she has no intention of being caught. 
 The Chase she leads him on had me in stitches. I wasn't kidding when I said she was mean. She'll do anything to keep from giving in to her feelings and some of the shit she pulls on him is freaking hilarious. Well, until she poked the bear one too many times and the rabid Viking wolf came out to play. 
 The meaner Miki got, the more turned on Conall became which worked out well because these two are hot together. I'm surprised every time I read this my iPad doesn't explode into flames. Conall may not be quite a genius like his woman but he is unbelievably creative in the bedroom. 
 There's a new adversary in Go Fetch and they are creepy as hell, even the kids! Conall's family isn't all that great either but they were more for comic relief than any real threat. 
 Go Fetch has everything I love rolled up into one book. Strong characters who don't take themselves too seriously, lots of action, it's hotter than hot, and full of snark and fun. 
 Rating: 5 Loved The Viking, but Miki Wins Stars"
4,"I originally bought Wonder because of Asti's review, and I pulled this book's name out of my TBR jar months ago. Finally... I have read it! And now I understand what all the fuss is about. Auggie is the most adorable, loveable main character, but he's got a really difficult life. This book was very well written; each perspective (and there are several) has a distinct and believable voice, showing different sides of the whole story. I fell in love with Auggie, the book's message, and... well, hey, just go read it!"
1,"What's worse than living under a fascist regime? Working for an equally fascist ""rebellion"". 
 I can't say enough bad things about this book or how this series was ended."
4,"So I was iffy about this book at first, it was a book club pick and I have not had good luck with sci-fi. I love watching it but haven't enjoyed reading it. But, I was pleasantly surprised. In the beginning it was a little hard to keep the characters and their names straight but over time it became clearer and was a very interesting story. Definitely not for people who don't like the ""f"" word that's for sure haha but I'm told that's not a surprise for this author so, you'll know if it's not your first book by him. I actually look forward to the sequel!"
1,"Things I liked: it ended. 
 Things that were meh: it began? 
 Things I couldn't get behind: FLIPPING EVERYTHING. THIS BOOK WAS SO FLIPPING AWFUL. I only finished reading it so I could yell about it on goodreads with authority. That is literally the only reason. 
 First off, the anachronisms. This is a feudal society. They live in castles and ride horses. There's no evidence that their science has progressed past ""there's a sun in the sky, stuff grows, idk."" THEY HEAL PEOPLE WITH MAGIC. So how in the WORLD would someone in this society know what immunity is? What antibodies are? That this would be carried in your blood? 
 Also can we talk about curing people of disease by injecting your blood straight into their bloodstream? Like, that's all frickin well and good IN A REALM OF MAGIC, I guess, except that there are OTHER blood born diseases that could be, idk, SOMEWHAT PROBLEMATIC. Not to mention the fact that unless you're a universal donor, frickin injecting your blood into TWENTY RANDOM PEOPLE would be toxic to at least some of them? Have you read what an ABO reaction looks like? It isn't pretty. 
 Why did this book use American military ranks? Why would that make sense in this setting? Why would a character in this feudal society know the term ""biological warfare""? 
 There was no indication anywhere that this society is Christian based or has even HEARD of Christianity, so why would ""Thank the Lord"" be a phrase they would know to bastardize? The author might think ""Thank the Flea"" is funny (she's wrong), but it makes no sense. 
 Two characters that are together (but are not paternal figures to the rest of their group) are fighting and then talk about splitting up the group. One of the members of the group then refers to that exchange as a ""custody battle"" which, outside of the realm of modern legal jargon, MAKES NO SENSE. 
 Like EITHER YOU HAVE CREATED THIS FANTASY WORLD WITH RULES THAT YOU OPERATE IN, MARIA SNYDER, OR YOU'RE JUST BEING FLIPPING LAZY. YOU'VE BEEN FLIPPING LAZY AND CREATED AN AREA WHERE RULES DON'T EXIST AND LOGIC DOESN'T APPLY UNLESS YOU TELL US IT DOES. WHICH IS NO WAY TO WRITE A BOOK, MARIA. IT JUST ISN'T. 
 I'm giving this one star so it actually counts against the metrics, but rest assured that if there was a searchable ""no stars"" I WOULD GIVE THIS ZERO STARS. I WOULD GIVE THIS NEGATIVE STARS. I WOULD DELETE THIS BOOK FROM THE EARTH. 
 Oh my god I forgot about the cannibals. HOW DID I FORGET ABOUT THE CANNIBALS. And the plot inconsistencies. I was so mad about the anachronisms. 
 So surprise!!! This book has cannibals!!!!!!!!!! It not only has cannibals, it has cannibals that literally bite people to torture them for information. So there's this GREAT (this is so sarcastic, in case you couldn't tell) scene that pretty frickin closely resembles rape where the Skeleton King (who is also describes as having thick skeletal fingers AND HOW CAN THEY BE BOTH) bites her all over her body (and yes I do mean ALL OVER HER BODY) and literally right after she starts thinking about whether this guy or the other guy were worse. She decided the biting made the Skeleton King more intolerable. Like. Okay. People react to trauma in different ways. Except SHE NEVER REACTS TO THE TRAUMA. IT'S JUST LIKE A THING THAT HAPPENS, WHATEVER, NO BIG. He bites her DOWN TO THE BONE and she's described later as having bruises. Bruises. No blood. She puts on a shirt and manages to hide everything. Like. What? Pretty sure a bite down to the bone is gonna break some skin. Pretty frickin sure people are gonna notice that, especially people you're sleeping with. And there I mean literally sleeping, not the euphemism. 
 And the reason they became cannibals in the first place was rather blithely given as they were running out of food, so they had to start eating people. But like. Like. They can't eat plague victims because they have the plague? And the plague is the reason there was scarcity? So they were killing not plague victims? I guess? And creating more scarcity? What kind of sense does that make? If you're going to have cannibals JUST MAKE THEM CANNIBALS. Why try to give them weird reasons for being a cannibal? ALSO WHY HAVE CANNIBALS. YOUR BOOK IS PUBLISHED BY HARLEQUIN, FRICKIN WRITE LIKE IT. 
 Avry also will randomly decide to balk at killing someone? Despite the fact that she kills lots of people who are bad. Sometimes, when someone's attacking her, she doesn't. Because she's a healer and she should be saving people? I guess? Character arcs ain't nothin', I guess. 
 deus ex machina: You can try to pretend Noak isn't exactly what I'm calling him, but you'll never convince me. A character from the north comes down and immediately identifies exactly what's wrong with both main characters and their connections to each other and the bad guy. Okay, sure. Except that magic users have been in the realm since forever, and literally no one had ever heard of them bonding before? This was a new thing? Why did it need to be explained? It felt like that scene in the movie version of ROTK: Arwen's fate is now tied to that of the ring. WHY? Because you said so??? 
 Frick. Okay, I think I'm actually done this time."
4,"I totally enjoyed myself while reading this (on a day when I should be studying to be honest). 
 The book takes time to get going but before you know it, it pulls you in. Lighthearted but not daft, emotional but never sappy. A great, cute, unconventional love story!"
3,"I reread this book after seeing a discussion about this book, and not remembering a single thing about it. Upon revisiting, I realized how much my reading taste has evolved. I cannot believe that I enjoyed the insta-love and the wishy washy student-teacher relationship. I got tired of the, ""I love you, I can't be with you, let's be together, we can't be together, but we end up together anyway after difficult circumstances."" What's the point in all of that? Although I lost my ""love"" for the romance, I still appreciate the other relationships the main character has (with her brother, her mother, and her friend) and the poetry."
5,"5 HOT STARS~ 
 Christina and Lauren has hit the ball out of the park with this book. Don't let them fool you that they can't write smut like other authors because these two CAN. 
 First we met the fiery and hot tempered Bennett Ryan in Beautiful Bastard. A panty ripper who collects panties for his safe keeping. Then we were introduced to Max Stella, a Beautiful Stranger. A gorgeous Brit who loves all things relating to fulfilling a woman's fantasy and taking sexy photos of her. I wished Christina Lauren had warn me about that Beautiful Player named Will Sumner. Holy goodness of all things steamy and wet. He by far is my favorite of the three Beautiful guys. 
 Beautiful Player was released on 10/29/13 and is the third book in Christina Lauren's Beautiful series. We first met Will briefly in Stranger as well as Bombshell and only knew him as a player who has a calendar of women. You're probably thinking Player = Douche Bag. This is so not the case here. He's a smooth talker as well as an operator. He's got an amazing man part, strong hands and a delicious mouth that'll make you start fanning yourself. Oh and lets not forget his smoldering good looks. He's going to make you feel like you've just cheated on Bennett and/or Max. 
 Mr. William Sumner thinks no one woman will carve their way into his heart. AND never in a million years was he going to be pussy whip like Bennett and Max. Boy, was he so wrong! He didn't realize that by taking on a challenge to help his best friend's sister Ziggy gain a social life away from the lab, she'd also be swimming her way into his heart and staying there. 
 Hanna 'Ziggy' Bergstrom, I love her. I want to be her! Not because she got Will but because she has no filter and she says whatever comes to mind. She's naive and oblivious in certain areas but that's what makes her such a catch for Will. I think some of us can confess that we have a little Ziggy buried inside of us. (I know I do!) 
 In my opinion, Will and Hanna couldn't be a better pair. Together these two embark on a delicious friends with benefits, instructor/student, my best friend's little sister relationship filled with steamy sex, heart breaking conversations and laugh out loud moments. 
 Their story was well written and like the other books in this series, it alternates from his and her POV. You many need to whip out the dictionary because these two hot nerdy scientist has quite the sophisticated language going. 
 So my lovelies, you don't want to miss this read. For the single ladies, you may want to lace up your tennis shoes because you never know when you'll run into a Beautiful Player, like Will Sumner on those crisp morning run."
4,"I haven't seen the movie yet, but the book provided to be a good if not a classic read. Since the targeted audience for the books were teenagers, I didn't expect much of the book but enjoyed it quite a bit. The starting scenario of dystopia followed by fight their life kept me gripping the book till the penultimate parts and the ending was quite a bit of climax. Overall 4/5... a once-read book."
5,"A multi-media experience extraordinaire. This is the future of print-publishing. Please make all of my books have margin notes, inserts, and napkin maps. The bonus, the totally real old book smell! 
 Besides the awesome packaging of S., the novel and the story that plays out in the margins between Eric and Jen is so enthralling, yet leaves just enough to the imagination to keep you wanting more. Now that I have finished, I'm doing a lot of message board surfing to see what I missed. I will definitely be ordering a copy soon and will need to do a re-read (many times over)."
4,"I loved the bleak, moroseness of this. So different from Wilde's typical flippant, comical nature - and yet, there was such tongue-in-cheek attitude throughout, that I think it still managed to cater to its comical roots."
4,"I really did not expect this rather short novel to be what it turned into. I was not prepared for it to turn into a quite beautiful elegy of love, death, and the unknown. At first, I thought it was just a spooky, kind of scary ghost story (which part of it remains). But I think it also turned into much more than that. 
 Jake and Zoe, a youg married couple, are on a skiing holiday in France, when they are buried under a sudden avalanche. Jake rescues Zoe, and the tale weaves it's way from there. It is by turns eerie, spooky, very thought-provoking, and a page-turner. I found the ending to be poignant, lovely, and unexpected."
4,"Enjoyable if short m/m crime thriller. Loved the partnership of agents Will and Taylor. 
 Taylor's lashes lifted. ""Did you mean it? What you said before about taking it one day at a time?"" 
 ""Yeah I meant it. Of course I did. I'm not letting you go without a fight."""
4,And these just keep getting better. Can't wait to get the second half of this series.
2,"Not my favorite couple, but it was a cute story. I find the romance situation a bit weird as they are in a kinda boss and worker relationship, but not directly. Those aren't always my favorite and the slight age difference."
5,"I thought this book was so realistic and I loved it for that. I think this book told the story of teenage love that a lot of books pretend doesn't exist, or skim over, making the broken heart something that happens in the beginning so that some amazing guy can swoop in and show her that love really does exist and it can be beautiful. Instead, this book followed how things really work in real life. You fall for someone and sometimes you give them everything you have and they let you down. It's painful, it sucks, it's not fair. But it's totally and completely real. I think this book exemplifies that the happy ending doesn't always mean that amazing romance that will last forever. Sometimes it just means moving on."

0,"I gave up on this book about 1/4 of the way in - the writing was clunky and the protagonist was annoyingly whiny, a sort of Stephanie Plum with a spellbook. 
 I really like the few urban fantasy novels I've read (such as Abramovich's Peter Grant series; The Dirty Streets of Heaven) and thought this would be similar but I was disappointed. The tone felt more like a cozy mystery series and with a few exceptions, I'm not much of a cozy fan."
3,"Stuck between 3 and 4 stars. 
 My heart broke a little in the aftermath of when Vic found out. Tears were shed, so the book was on par emotionally. I liked it, but unfortunately I was sort of over it towards the end."
3,I wept at the last chapter. The loneliness of Whyborne's father came too close to home.
4,"More like 4 1/2 stars. 
 This is really good historical fiction. There is a reason everyone loves this one. Will definitely be reading the sequel--right after I finish watching the miniseries. 
 Thanks to M for having the courage to give me a book."
5,"** spoiler alert ** 
 Deliciously good-- or bad might be more appropriate. The Rose Society had me screaming internally all along the way. I love how Adelina truly becomes full form villain because it makes me eager to see her find redemption. I'm guessing she'll probably have her powers taken away later. The Rose Society doesn't sugarcoat. It's dark, gruesome and full of depraved deeds, yet still we find ourselves caring for Adelina because Lu knows how to write her stories. 
 Pretty sure she isn't ending up with Enzo after all her lies and betrayals. NOOOOOOOOOOO. But I also ship Adelina with Magiano so I don't even know anymore. The problem with two perfectly good love interests is that one ends up alone. Wasteful. 
 Now it's up to Violetta to remove those filthy whispers from Adelina. I hope she joins the Daggers in the next book. I really miss reading about them."

4,"Quick warning: this story has been previously published in the ""Dangerous Women"" short story collection, which Sanderson admits in the intro he was a bit anxious about. So if you own it, don't buy this. 
 One of the fun things about Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere multiverse is that, with multiple worlds to play in, he can create lots of little side-stories with interesting characters without being restricted. One good example would be ""Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell,"" a novella about a powerful bounty hunter who doesn't fit the leather-wearing, snarky stereotype -- which makes the story all the more intriguing. 
 In the Forests of Hell, there is a legendary bounty hunter known as the White Fox. According to the stories, no one knows the White Fox's identity -- and if you see his face, he'll kill you. He's afraid of nothing, and only goes after big-time criminals (not, say, small-time horse thieves). No one would ever guess that he has anything to do with the middle-aged innkeeper Silence Montane. 
 When bandit-turned-assassin Chesterton Divide and his men come into her inn, Silence immediately recognizes them -- and so does Sebruki, a child whose family was murdered by him. With the help of her daughter William Ann, she goes out into the night to find Chesterton's gang... only to be cornered by another gang of vicious bounty hunters and a swarm of shades. And before the night is our, she may lose what is most precious to her. 
 Most of Sanderson's stories are a bit more urban in nature, but ""Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell"" takes place in a more remote part of this fantasy world. It's in a sparsely-populated forest continent, riddled by ghostly shades who can only be banished with silver arrows, and which are attracted to motion, flames and blood. It gives the feeling that this is a place which is actually pretty scary -- think the Wild West combined with a haunted forest full of ghosts. 
 Sanderson's writing is typically robust and riddled with poetic moments (""The heads rippled, faces shifting like smoke rings. They trailed waves of whiteness about an arm's length behind them""), and he puts plenty of horrifying moments in what seems like a standard bounty hunt. He manages to cram a lot of plot and worldbuilding into a pretty brief story, including a scheme by the cruel Theopolis to force Silence to sell her inn. 
 And Silence is a pretty awesome character -- she's strong and deadly without being icy or sociopathic, and breaks the mold of what people imagine an action heroine to be. What's more, she isn't one of those characters who revels in her ability to go out and bludgeon bandits to death; if anything, she's scarred by a childhood with her cold-blooded grandmother, which comes to a head as she deals with all the worst things in the forests. 
 For those who are just getting into Brandon Sanderson's work, ""Shadows For Silence in the Forests of Hell"" is a strong little introduction -- and longtime fans will know exactly what to expect. Powerful writing, some solid twists, and a genuinely spooky setting."
5,The writing is so GOOD my brain is all tingly.
4,"In a nutshell, this is the best and most informative of the books I've read this year about North Korea. As I already knew a lot going into this book some parts felt slow and I know that was just me, but I knocked off one star because of that. 
 Heartbreaking stories, hard facts and most imporantly it shows what real and ordinary lives are like in North Korea. I highly recommend this."
3,"This series is ok. It's not my favorite but it's alright. The dialogue irritates me and the narrator on the audiobook just makes the story REALLY cheesy. However, I don't know if it would be any less cheesy if I just read it myself."
3,"I'm surprised that the end didn't feel as amazing as I thought it would be. I could barely put it down until I'm finished, as always with Sanderson's works, but I feel somewhat dissatisfied. I wonder why. Maybe I'll get back to this review once I figure it out."
3,"Not my favorite Sarah Dessen book. I think I might have like What Happened to Goodbye even more than this one. I appreciated that the story was about Emaline figuring herself out and not about her falling in love but I wanted there to be more with the relationship side of things. The aftermath of her breaking up with her boyfriend of three years was nothing, she felt bad and sad and then she moved on. It was unbelievable. Literally. 
 Full-er Review from Brain On Pause 
 I have to give Sarah Dessen the credit for making me fall in love with reading. I didn't become an avid reader until I discovered her books back in middle school. I read one book which was followed by another and another until eventually I'd read all her books and eagerly anticipated each new release. The Moon and More is her most recent novel and of course I had to read it. 
 First of all, I opened this book and just after the first page was hit by a wave of nostalgia. Sarah Dessen has a way of writing that is just so smooth and nice to read and I've missed that cause the last time I'd read a book by her was when What Happened to Goodbye came out several years ago. Having said that, I don't think that this is some of her best work. It seemed like it was lacking in the things that are classic in Dessen novels. Things that her fans have come to expect from every book. For example, generally the main character is easy to relate to and they all have their own personal issues that most girls can sympathize with. Emaline's issue was probably that she wasn't really sure about her future and what she wanted in life but it seemed more like Emaline's issue was about a guy or maybe two. Secondly, I wasn't rooting for either guy which might have been the point. Maybe the whole point was that Emaline needs to focus on herself and that doesn't have to involve a boy. I'm all for that but if she's going to be in a relationship then I wish there was some purpose behind it. I found myself wondering why she was in this relationship in the first place. There's also a break-up in this book which did not feel like a break up at all to me. It lasted about 5 minutes and considering the circumstances I would think that she would maybe be a little more sad and not be over it as soon as she was. 
 This book wasn't bad. It just didn't live up to Sarah Dessen standards. It was missing or lacking in the classic Sarah Dessen elements that we've come to love."
4,"Solid sequel, not gonna lie. I love me some Wallbanger Simon once in a while."
4,"This is a story about Arthur, a man who sees and hears things that others cannot, and Fox, a thief who steals his way into Arthur's home and life. As things went along, it wasn't entirely clear what was going on with Arthur. Was he really suffering from a mental illness? Was he experiencing a brush with the supernatural? Was someone trying to trick him into thinking he was mentally ill when he wasn't? All are options that are brought up as the story progresses. 
 I liked the way that Arthur's mental illness was handled. Whatever the cause, seeing things that others don't, being medicated because of it, and being isolated from others would take its toll, and I was glad to see that reflected in this book. 
 I also enjoyed the interaction between Fox and Arthur. It was really nice to see that both men had strengths and weaknesses and that neither was wholly ""on their game"" so to speak; it would have been more disheartening if one or the other had been perfect and had ""rescued"" the other from their circumstances, but that isn't what happened. Both had their good points and their flaws, and they both worked together to make a better whole. 
 Something that kind of surprised me was that it wasn't entirely clear when Arthur came to realize that Fox wasn't a delusion. Given the buildup, I expected that to be more of a revelation, but it was pretty much glossed over. It was clear that at some point Arthur realized this, but when? I couldn't tell. 
 One of the things I didn't like about the book is that the ending is incredibly abrupt, so much so that I was actually surprised that the book actually ended where it did. Because I had a digital copy and not a paper copy, I flipped back and forth between some of the advertisements for other books and the ending of the book a couple of times, thinking maybe I had accidentally skipped forward or something. But no, that was actually the ending."
2,"I had high hopes for this book, and I'm sorry to say that it did not meet them. I found the characters banal and poorly defined, the story had numerous logical flaws, and the dialogue was supposedly 'stylized' but it did not work. 
 Any sci-fi or fantasy novel that STARTS with a few pages of glossary terms is doing it wrong. Lazy world-building at its finest. It's basically telling a reader to study up, this will be on the test, and we're not going to go over it in class. I'm not against books where there are alien/foreign type cultures with their own languages and such, but if the author can't explain them in context in the story itself, especially when there would be ample excuse for that exposition because there are characters in the story just as unfamiliar with the terms as I am, I have very little motivation to bother to learn. 
 The first hundred or so pages are the worst part of the book. (view spoiler)[Basically, Isaac and his fellow crew members rescue a guy from the movie ""Event Horizon."" A sole survivor of some kind of prison ship(?) that was attacked by aliens, Turk is mentally unstable and violent enough that they have to sedate him to even get him aboard. But of course, Isaac already has the hots for him, and vice versa. 
 None of the crew of this ship have any common sense or logic. At the very least, in their situation, a realistic approach would be to keep the dude in either a sickbay or brig kind of setting for observation and treatment until they know more. Instead, Isaac unstraps the dude as soon as he wakes up. The FIRST THING Turk does is become violent to Isaac, but that's okay. Just fine and dandy. The captain doesn't care, the doctor doesn't care, NO ONE CARES. Not even when it's clear that Turk is a few fries short of a happy meal in that he's hallucinating at times and having PTSD-like episodes - during one of which he once again assaults Isaac - and now has some kind of weird attachment to Isaac. 
 But it's totally fine this dangerous, mentally unstable dude to go walking around the ship, and Isaac - far from being disturbed by all this - takes to snuggling up with him in the same bunk every night for a week. Just before they reach their destination, Turk goes all out and decides that they are soulmates and they have sex that is very meh - the one thing it's got going for it is that it's totally, explicitly consensual. The author also use the ridiculous and bland euphemism 'back channel' a few times to describe the butt part of the buttsex, which I found grating, along with Turk's tendency to call Isaac 'little one.' 
 Also, Turk's singing somehow 'resonates' with a person's 'magnetic field' and that somehow stops Isaac's nervous system from choking on itself because of his botched pilot-implant. Which isn't explained at all well (neither implant OR magic voice) and yes any sufficiently advanced form of technology can be mistaken for magic, but I'm pretty sure that's just plain old magic at this point. (hide spoiler)] 
 The romance in the first third of the book is very, very forced. Hardly any attention is paid the character development, letting past traumas stand in for personalities. The dialogue. The dialogue makes me headdesk. The lack of logical behavior on the part of EVERYONE makes me headdesk more. 
 Finally, things start picking up once the rescue ship reaches its destination. I found the actual scenes on the space station pretty predictable. (view spoiler)[As soon as it was revealed that Turk was some kind of SUPER SEEKRIK SPECIAL BLACK OPS GENETIC EXPERIMENT SHHH DON'T TELL (BUT WE TATTOOED IT ON HIM RIGHT THERE) - well, I could see where this was going. Of course, the bad guys end up kidnapping and torturing Isaac to keep Turk in line. The crew of Isaac's ship rescues them, and they flee to Turk's crazy dinosaur homeworld, where Isaac is saved from the brink of death by the race of four-armed dinosaurish people. (hide spoiler)] 
 However, once we get to Turk's homeworld, I found myself enjoying the book more. The world of the Drak'tar and the societies of both the Corzin and Drak'tar are very interesting to me. There is more worldbuilding here than any other part of the book, and it's pretty good worldbuilding at that. Glossary terms are even occasionally explained in context! Wowza! I wanted more of this place. 
 My one gripe about this bit is when they were talking about the sex-segregated Corzin society, it seemed like the author was defensive about it, with Isaac suddenly getting into his uppity-feminist mode that had never before been seen in the book. I guess this book is one from a quartet set in the same universe, so I wonder if the author hadn't taken some flak for the lack of female characters in one or any of the previous installments? Anyway, the justification doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but it is pointedly Not Misogynist Thank You Very Much. It's just that everyone is gay or lesbian, and everyone is a test-tube baby. 
 Unfortunately, there's a space battle at the end, because it's sci-fi and you HAVE TO. The battle is hohum, and of course the MC are courageous and victorious, but the book doesn't end there. It's really anticlimactic, like someone took the end of ""Return of the Jedi"" and replaced it with five minutes of a random Star Trek: TNG episode. It doesn't work for me. 
 I had a lot of questions left at the end. (view spoiler)[For one, why would ESTO use a valuable emissary from an isolated, misunderstood culture as an experimental subject in the first place? If Turk's secret destructive power is created in his mind and not his voice, why does gagging him stop him from using it? Turk starts the story pretty mentally disturbed, but we never really get to see how he copes/recovers from that, unless you believe in sexual healing. Why does a society that has apparently been a utopia amongst themselves need a warrior-caste like the Corzin? Yes, big toothy predators and such, but their whole culture is based on fighting/war to the point where their families are war-bands and they apparently interfere in OTHER PEOPLE's wars to prove themselves. It just doesn't make sense. (hide spoiler)]"
5,"I don't cry much, and only rarely is a novel able to make me cry. So when I say a book made me cry, it's meant as high praise. ""The Mating of Michael"" had me blubbering in the doctor's waiting room, scrambling to find a tissue before anyone caught me making a fool of myself."
5,"This book was like all NS books...She focuses on a couple but gives glimpses to other things happening in the Psy-Changling world... 
 I love the insights into Sienna and Hawke and how she is strong enough to understand him and her journey getting to know the rest of the pack.. their mating ceremony is in this book as well. 
 Riaz and Adria become a couple in this world without a mating bond.... which made it really romantic, sweet and more believable than the magic 'mating bond'.... which can make a coupling a bit forced ... like everything is out of their hands.... Extra effort was needed this time and it was fun reading what fun things he did... 
 There was no real ""ending"" to this book... it just stops ... that was a bit of a mystery.... 
 Now we need to know who has been found!!! 
 Hungry for more please!!!"
4,"I really liked this one, and i had only a few minor issues with it. (view spoiler)[ Like how Camden hadn't fired away with questions on his first trip there, but simply 'forgotten' to ask Nina a lot of relevant questions. Or how it's rather normal (however problematic) to have insecurity/jealousy/needy issues but it's a bit extreme to go running over your boyfriend. None the less for a teenager. To me that was a bit too much drama-inflicted-plot-scheming. Teenage girl losing both her parents in an accident and having to take care of her younger brother more or less on her own also seemed a tad over-dramatic and overkill ish. Another plot-demand to explain her differencies in the two alternating timelines . (hide spoiler)] 
 I really liked the idea of alternate timelines, which I found super fascinating. Even if I kind of had figured out several plot twists before they were revealed, which always to me make the main characters seem a bit dumb, because they haven't realized/figured out or at least had the awareness to ask about something that is either obvious in itself or obvious that someone has the answer to. 
 The characters, their personalities and their relationship and feelings were well depicted and seemed believable (except for one action stated above. ) not too heavy on the cliches/stereotypes, but more subtle to make it acceptable. 
 The writing was rather good and seemed to flow, except for a few spots where I had trouble figuring out what prompted a character to say what they did. 
 Certainly a recommended read if you have experienced loss, or if you are just into mystery or stories about alternating time."
4,"""You may tell a tale that takes up residence in someone's soul, becomes their blood and self and purpose. That tale will move them and drive them and who knows that they might do because of it, because of your words."" 
 Such gorgeous writing! This book reads with a dreamlike quality. It is not a book that should be gulped down, but a book to be savoured in all it's mysterious, magical glory. 
 ""Because I do not wish to know,"" he says. ""I prefer to remain unenlightened, to better appreciate the dark."" 
 This circus that has been created as a battleground for two ilussionists sounds so unreal and fascinating that I am dying to see it! There is so much detail in the writing of it that I do in fact half feel that I was already there, and dammit I want to go back. Morgenstern has created a captivating world with original, strange characters that kept me reading in delighted wonder. 
 ""Because I do not wish to know,"" he says. ""I prefer to remain unenlightened, to better appreciate the dark."" 
 A lot of books, even when in third person, read like you are experiencing it firsthand. This is not such a book. It felt like I was watching it, not living it and while I do generally prefer to connect more with the characters I think this was perfect for the mysterious strangeness of the book. 
 I don't really know how to articulate my experience with this book, anything I say now feels clunky compared to its eloquence. Such a beautiful read, definitely recommended!"
3,"An interesting take on the sacrifices we all make to fit in, and how easily it can backfire on us. The juxtaposition of cutesy and sweet with the horrifying direction the plot takes might give me nightmares. Geh."
1,"1 Star 
 I'm sorry but I was disappointed. 
 Where do I begin? 
 November, a girl who grew up in New York, moved to Tennessee when she was fed-up with her abusive single mom and was randomly attacked by a stranger. In her new home she finally reunited with her long-lost father. Eventually, she started working for his club, not as a stripper but as an office worker. There, she met the hottest guy on the planet-- Asher James Mayson, who has siblings that are equally hot. Asher is not only irresistible but he has also a bad-boy personality which made her totally smitten. He's also rich as he owns a security company. And then... they fell in love. Then things start to get crazy as November's attacker followed her and made her life miserable. 
 So, there was insta-love here. And I hated it because it's super duper insta-love! When Asher called her ""baby"" on their first date I was like, WTH? 
 And then he's got all-protective Alpha and jealous even if they're still new and that's it. I was so annoyed. His approach was manipulative. He treated November as if she doesn't have the right to decide and the right to refuse. What. The. Actual. Fuck. 
 And then he kidnapped her (like literally!) because he's ""interested"". Seriously? And not only that. He even took her phone and keys so she can't get away from him. What a creep! 
 ""I'm not ready to have you out of my sight."" 
 ""Why?"" 
 ""Because I'm interested."" 
 ""I'm sure."" I roll my eyes. ""So if you're interested, then why not ask me out like a normal guy instead of basically kidnapping me?"" 
 ""Why, if I asked you out, you would have blown me off and avoided me. This way, you don't have a choice. I have your keys and your phone."" 
 ""You have my phone?"" I screech, opening my bag to see if he's telling the truth. ""How did you get my phone? Oh my God, you're insane. I'm driving down a dark road with an insane person who kidnapped me."" 
 And don't even get me started on the cheese and the predictable plot twist. 
 Thanks for the lots of patience I was able to finish it, but not without me rolling my eyes at least 20 times. *sigh"
4,"I kept thinking throughout this book, ""Twelve-year-old boys sure can whinge!"" I'd find myself getting impatient with Todd, and then remembering that he's only twelve (nearly thirteen - counting down the days) and realising again what great characterisation it was. My grandson is only five yet (nearly six - counting down the days) but I can imagine him being just like Todd, given the circumstances of course. 
 This book for teens is set on a colonised planet a long way from earth. The first settlers were religious refugees almost, and not far in from the beginning of the book we meet the preacher, a real fire-and-brimstone holy-man. We also meet nastiness and misery and lust and hatred, all roiling around in men's thoughts, all present to Todd and to the reader because every living thing on this planet broadcasts whatever is going on in its mind. It's called Noise, and for the most part is unwanted. 
 Then Todd hears a Silence, and before the day is out his world has changed. He's forced to flee for his life. 
 This is a book of high adventure, though there is no thrill of discovery nor sense of achievement. Rather, one thing piles on top of another and destruction follows Todd as everything he'd been taught about the history of his world is turned upside down, and as he has to face extreme danger and violence and constant failure in what he has been tasked with. 
 It's also a book about holding on to your true nature, and finding resilience and fortitude, and learning to listen to and understand others. There are great characters, and amazing animals - Ness does their 'thoughts' brilliantly, and a totally believable world. 
 I'm going to read the second in the series as soon as I can!"
4,"Earlier this year when I joined NetGalley, I received the second book in this series, Claimed. Ever since then I have been dying to read more about this world. When I found out that book three was imminent, I headed back to NetGalley and was greeted with the chance to request both Fated and book one, Marked. It was so great to get back into the world, and also to catch up on what I had missed out on. Marked was amazing and fun, intense and sexy, just as wonderful as Claimed. Eli and Cacia were just phenomenal. I loved everything about them, as individuals, coworkers, friends...everything! As I had with Claimed, I loved the family dynamics and the sibling relationships. Eli and Galena have a wonderful bond, as do Declan and Cacia. Is it a perfect book? Probably not. But is it an amazing read? Hell Yeah! Bring on Fated!!"

4,"Why did I read Dark Matter? 
 Blake Crouch. The science was a complete surprise. You'd think the title ""Dark Matter"" would have clued me in, but no. I didn't give it much thought past it being a new Blake Crouch. I enjoyed his book Run, and then I loved the Wayward Pines trilogy. I need to make some time for some more of his back titles, too. 
 The Strengths 
 SCIENCE. This is how I love my science - mixed with a page turning thriller. Dark Matter is not hard science either. It's heavy science if you consider the fact that it deals with quantum physics, but it is presented in a way that's accessible to everyone. 
 It's a fun read which I'm coming to expect from Blake Crouch. 
 The Weaknesses 
 It's hard to articulate what makes it a 4 star and not a 5 star read for me, but part of it has to do with how the story progressed. It could go any way at any time which is fun, but it's hard to lose myself or care more than just at a superficial level as I'm stepping through short chronological events. You're mileage may vary here. 
 Would I recommend Dark Matter to others? 
 Yep!"
3,"I've been putting re-reading this book off, for a long time. I read it a long time ago, and didn't really remember it. I have grown so much as a reader, and I just wanted to read it again to see what I thought. The truth is that I've heard positive things, but also lots of negative things. So kept putting if off and about a week ago, I just picked it up and started re-reading it. I'm so glad that I've read it again, because while I wont say that I loved it, I did like it. 
 The plot was a bit slow moving, and because of that the book starts out a bit slow. I didn't really know where it was supposed to be going. Even though it went slow, I couldn't stop turning pages because the questions just kept building. There were so many things I didn't understand and wanted to understand. When I got to the ending, the twists in the plot surprised the hell out of me. But where the most of the story and plot was really slow, the ending just happened, out of nowhere it became fast paced and action packed, it felt a bit rushed to me. A lot was left unexplained, so I hope that's to come in the next books. 
 What the gradual and slow build also did for me, was that it made me understand the characters even better. You learn enough about a character to satisfy you, but on the other hand you don't know nearly enough and it makes you wonder just who and what they are. There's quite some mystery surrounding most characters, which makes Fallen interesting. 
 I really liked Luce. She was honest and a bit naive, but all and all she's a great character. She did become a bit of a damsel in distress at the end of Fallen, but I expect that in the next books in this series she'll develop. If I liked Luce, you'll probably expect that I loved Penn! She was such a great friend and just an awesome character. 
 The love-triangle was a bit cliche though. It wasn't horrible, it was okay most of the time because Luce figured out what it was she wanted pretty soon. It was a bit useless actually, Daniel was a big jerk for the first half of the book, but it becomes clear right away when they meet that they'll end up together. It was kind of inevitable, but there still was a love-triangle anyway. 
 The cover art is great! Its what got my attention when I first saw the book. A slow-burner, but its well worth to keep reading. I'm definitely reading the next book!"
5,"7. COLLECTING MY THOUGHTS: A REVIEW BY ANURADHA HERUR 
 Buddy read with the amazing Fabian (whom everyone here knows as Councillor). 
 If this doesn't end up on my top three reads in 2017, I will eat my hat. Before I start my review, I must say I love Matthias's review of this book. Not only is it my favourite review of the book, but it is one of the best book reviews I've ever read. 
 Also, I was skimming some of the reviews of this book, and from what I could see, not many people liked Half-lives - The First Luisa Rey Mystery. I, on the other hand, thoroughly enjoyed it, because I love me some hard-boiled detective stories. What slowed me down, however, was Sloosha's Crossin' and Ev'rythin' After.

2,"This was ok. Here's what didn't work for me: 
 1. Saps - all of them! There were tears, and hand over the heart melodrama, and the most irritating of all, (view spoiler)[ the constant reference to ""my husband"". We were all waiting for their big day, but by the end I wanted to strangle both of them. We get it, they got married. Let's move on! (hide spoiler)] 
 2. The mystery/crime - I liked the premise and I was interested in the beginning, but then it turned into one ridiculous and convoluted action scene after another. They were all the same. By 70%, I was bored and annoyed at every turn. 
 3. Practically every character from previous books was thrown in, whether they fit into the story or not. 
 What I did like was (view spoiler)[ the spur of the moment wedding and when Ty and Nick made up. (hide spoiler)] 
 I still love Ty and Zane regardless of this book."
3,"[First read: 2007. 2 stars 
 Second read: 1st March, 2016. 3 stars.] 
 Read as part of The Infinite Variety Reading Challenge, based on the BBC's Big Read Poll of 2003. 
 Here's a big fat review (longer than I usually write, more rambling and less coherent) that will focus on the series as a whole, as well as just this book. 
 The first time I read this book-all those years ago when it first came out-I was pretty much fed up with Harry Potter at that point. It was too big: nothing deserves to be that big, not even Jesus, and it was, quite frankly, boring. So I skipped through the book and didn't really pay much attention. I also didn't see the film until much, much later and as a whole, the big pile of fandom just passed me by in to the void of nothingness behind me. 
 As the years passed by, I wanted to dip my toe back in. I was feeling a bit nostalgic, I admit, but I also wanted to see if the magic of Harry Potter that everyone was going on about was there for me, too. TLDR; it is not. 
 This book, the final of the series, is definitely one of the best of the series but it has some serious faults. You can definitely see the pressure that J.K. was under from, oh look, you lot, to finish the book and get it out so they could make the next film. I don't think this was quite the ending she really wanted and that is quite a big disappointment, though we can't hold the author accountable. (It's all your fault, really.) 
 We still have two protagonists who haven't changed much in seven years: Harry and Ron have been the same semi-intelligent, slightly amusing and stupidly brave boys that we met in the first book. Hermione, I am glad to say, has changed from book to book, though there were a few moments when she really went a bit dodgy. As far as the other characters, I have to say they were all pretty much background and dull. I still can't get over how Luna Lovegood just turns up and randomly becomes an important character without actually saying or doing much at all. I also think a lot more could have been done with Neville: I thought he was pretty great and the way he ended the series was wonderful. It's very difficult to enjoy a series of books when you don't like (not hate) the main character. Did anyone really care if Harry died at the end, as long as Voldemort did as well? I didn't. 
 I was also not a fan of the way most of the unpleasant characters were either fat or ugly. Most of the weird characters were a bit odd-looking, as well, and it just felt like an easy get-out of having to think of interesting characters who didn't conform to type. 
 The thing about fantasy is that it's usually mostly the locations and settings that really make it magical. Harry Potter is extremely limited in location and that really made it feel small and closed off. Yes, Hogwarts is a fun Scottish castle, but really how much do we know about Hogwarts; how much did we really see? We barely explore the place and the places around it. I understand that magical people are pretty much hidden away, but it always felt like such a lacking world. Hogwarts was no more magical than Harry's cupboard, really (enchanted ceiling notwithstanding). 
 The Deathly Hallows never quite felt like the ending it should have been. It was definitely the best written of the set, which just shows how a writer learns from their previous mistakes (which, sadly, a lot of authors don't seem to do) and the flow from preceding book to the follow up was better than it had been earlier on. 
 I can't really see myself ever reading these ever again, unless I really run out of things to read. I find that rather saddening, because I can remember a time in my childhood-during the first few years of the earlier books and films-when I really loved this series. I remember the two weeks I really wanted to be an actor so I could be in the film and elope with whoever it was that played Sirius (Gary Oldman, I know, but back then I didn't care). I strongly remember that I felt bad for being in love with Draco for about a year, too (I have a thing for blondes). I will look back fondly on my mis-remembered feelings on Luna and treasure my rekindled love for Hermione. I think I am incredibly lucky to be of an age where I grew up at the right time for this series, but I'm also not supremely disappointed that the magic is no longer there.

4,"And so it was a happy ever after... almost. And after much fighting, tragedies and gore. I had an inkling about Sarren's horrific surprise for Allison, and my hunch turned out to be correct. However, I did not anticipate the drudgery of the emotions and conversations between Allie and Zeke. Jackal, bless his bloodthirsty little heart, is a welcome relief and could be counted on to keep things interesting everytime. Too bad about Kanin though, although I must admit it was a poetic kind of justice how his end came about. All in all, the story was good but it kinda dragged and I still like The Eternity Cure much better."

 What an amazing , crazy, fucked up story!!! 
 I was totally unprepared for the wild ride I was about to take when I picked up this book. I had no idea what to expect, and even if I did, it wouldn't have prepared me for this epic glimpse into the world of rock and roll, this world that is Hybrid.... 
 It was an epic, flawless, tingling-deep-in-my-belly type of show..... It was a high unlike any other, a wave of perfection and human unity. It was all the purple prose in the world. It was magic. 
 The only way I can think to describe the story is that its like Almost Famous meets Ghost Rider. But if you're not a movie buff, it was like having all of your teenage dreams of rock and roll come true, only to find yourself stuck in a nightmare. You are invited on a trip of a lifetime, following your favorite band on tour, and being asked to participate with them as a professional, writing a story, that will not only bring you respect and recognition, it will also tell the world the story of the music that gives your life meaning. 
 But what you weren't expecting was that meeting your idols and getting a glimpse of their world behind the stage would open your eyes to the real life of the music world and the realization that success, fame, and fortune come with a price. And in the case of this band, Hybrid... the price was even much higher than anyone had bargained for. 
 It's 1974, Dawn Emerson is 21, living a small town life in the Pacific Northwest. She is living with her alcoholic father and her younger brother, having lost her mother several years earlier. Her life is pretty unexciting, other than her yearly participation in the town rodeo, as a barrel racing queen, and her occasional attendance to local rock concerts with her best friend Mel. 
 But Dawn has aspirations for more. She is in college, studying journalism and is aspiring to use her degree to become a music journalist. She has already written some killer articles for local papers, critiquing popular rock bands and their music. But she has yet to score any real recognition in the industry. So she is more than a little shocked when she gets a call from the editor of Creem Magazine asking her to join the tour of the hit band Hybrid, and write an article for their magazine that is likely going to gain cover status. 
 Hybrid is one of her favorite metal bands... and it doesn't take her long to accept this offer of a lifetime. So she leaves her life behind and joins the band and their crew on the road for their upcoming tour. And that's when the freaky shit starts happening. It starts from time she accepts the offer and boards the airplane and then it follows her everywhere. Is she suffering from nerves and stress, or is something else more sinister going on? 
 In the music world, Hybrid is a bastard combination of sexual prowess, chugging guitars, and swaggering bass with delicate hints of country blues and Latino flavor. It is a mess of a band, who, with their upcoming third album, are already pushing the envelope with their energetic live shows and intense fearlessness. 
 Dawn meets up with the band's manager Jacob Edwards and is immediately thrust into this crazy fucked up world that is Hybrid. The band members are larger than life, and as flawed as the best of us!!! First there is Robbie Oliver...swoon, the lead singer and one of the band's founders. He is gorgeous and charismatic, and flirts incessantly!! Then there is Mickey Brown, the band's guitarist, and his moody, enigmatic girlfriend and the band's bassist, Noelle Clark. The band's amazing drummer is Graham Freed, and kind of a Satan worshipping freak. 
 Then last, but certainly not least is the legend that is Sage Knightly. Sage is the band's main songwriter, and their lead guitarist. He is also the secret behind the band's success according to Dawn... and she has no idea just how right she is about that! 
 ""I wanted to be someone, someone important. I wanted to be revered, I wanted to be respected, I wanted to be loved. I wanted it all so much that I remember thinking I would do anything for it. I would give anything for it."" 
 Dawn is suddenly surrounded by a whirlwind of sex, drugs, and crazy, mercurial personalities. She soon realizes she is in way over her head, and she must struggle to keep up, and to keep from being sucked into their vortex. She has to stand her ground and remember her purpose or she just might fall victim to all that consumes them. She also must fight her attraction to these guys and their power over her. Especially the mysterious one. Sage. But his silence is what ignites her curiosity, and her inner fire as well. Dawn will soon find herself drowning if she doesn't watch herself. 
 This book was completely addicting. I was not prepared for the world that Dawn discovered on that tour bus. This book brought an even darker force into the mix. With the addition of the paranormal... this was the perfect melding of mystery, suspense, romance and even horror. 
 It seems that everyone is searching for success: fame and fortune, and also love. But for everything we wish for, there is a price. And the easier they come, the higher the price. And this was more than true for this band. And they would find that for them it was the ultimate price!!! 
 ""Thank you Dawn. I really should be happy for the support I do get...it's the curse that comes with success, I suppose. At first you want anyone, just anyone, to listen to you. Then you get that anyone, you get mostly everybody, then you want the critics, but it's not good enough. You want more. You want to push the boundaries and damn if the world decides to not watch."" -Sage 
 I cannot wait for the next book in the series!!!! 
 Brilliant story!!! 5 Stars!!! (waiting for the movie!!!)

4,"I have to give Brenda Novak credit for writing a book with such compelling characters that I wanted to jump into the book and give our heroine, Sophia, a hug and slap the rest of the town silly. Geez - talk about someone that no one will give a break to! If you've read the previous books, it's been hinted that Sophia is an abused spouse. This book confirms that assumption, but her husband dies trying to fake his own death after he pulled a Bernie Madoff scheme on the people of Whiskey Creek. Sophia and her daughter are left with nothing and this book is about her struggle to survive. 
 Now, I've never thought Whiskey Creek is a loving, caring town and this book further proves my point. You know the saying - with friends like these, who needs enemies? The people swindled ransack Sophia's house and take everything of value. The mayor is corrupt. The police chief is worse. The principal of the school acts terribly towards her daughter - this is the type of person helping the children in the town? Then we have Eve...at first I gave Eve credit for recognizing Sophia's issues and trying to help her - including helping her get a job with Ted. However, Eve becomes just as bad as the rest of the town treating Sophia horribly when Eve and Ted decide to date. That leads to my one issue with the book - the romance of Eve and Ted. I just think the entire book should have been focused on Ted and Sophia. As for Eve, I think there's a reason she can't get a man. Her behavior was a little crazy and made her a little unlikeable to me. If she ever gets her own book, it will be interesting to read. 
 Overall, it's a good read and a great addition to the Whiskey Creek series. 
 I received an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review."
1,"Amazing first half, super shitty second half. 
 The beginning was fantastic and very character driven. The second half felt like a completely different book, piled high with every post-apocalyptic cliche under the sun, none of which where utilized in interesting or exciting ways (and many of which were played horrifyingly, infuriatingly straight)."
3,"I feel like I may have missed something here - I resisted the hype at the end of last year to read this book, then finally sat down over the New Year, very excited about getting started. I liked it, the premise is interesting and the religious ideas occasionally thought provoking, but it was a bit of a struggle to get through. I happily kept going back to it but wasn't 'sucked in' to the world of Oasis as much as I had hoped. Maybe I expected too much."
3,"I think the only reason I like this book is because it was banned for so many years (strong women are such a problem, eh?) The writing bothered me a little bit. The whole thing seemed a bit contrived. 
 I've come to the conclusion, however, that the reason the thing seemed so fake was because I've read/seen/heard so many things like it. I know that when it was written it WAS probably completely shocking. 
 The character of Edna is just such a huge letdown for me. She could have done so much. She could've gotten out of her situation without doing what she did - for me that just seems like the weakest solution she could think up for her problem. She didn't seem to actually feel anything intensely for any of the characters in the books. They were just sort of her excuse. 
 Edna fell flat for me, and therefore the book did. 2.5 Stars."
4,"It's really well-written and plotted, with good worldbuilding. I couldn't care less about boxing, and I still enjoyed it, so any sports fan at all will probably love it."
4,"3.5 stars 
 This book fell in between the ' liked ' and 'not-really-crazy-about-the-sequel ' category. 
 That blurb sounds very promising. It promises a broken but determined character called Scarlett who wants to protect her sister against all odds. Honestly, this summary should have came with that little star ,saying 'terms and conditions applied'. 
 Remember how you feel when store promises min. 70% off and then you realize it has that very hard to notice star on it? That's how I felt while reading this book. Cheated. I went looking for great adventures and sisterly bond and ended up with pages felt with teenage love.It wasn't bad.But it could have been better. 
 In whole book,the only character we understand completely is Scarlett. She spent ages trying to survive under cruelty of her father but still hasn't given up hope.She is still looking for solution to her problem,which won't jeopardize the current pseudo safe state of her and her sister.I understand why she behaved like she did. She was realistic. She did not go after chasing some half formed plan just because she is the main character and she is supposed to do so. The course of her action was somewhat natural.(Somewhat because some of her actions were very questionable!) 
 Tella,her sister was just annoying. (view spoiler)[ Even though she turns up as the hero at the end,there's no forgiving her past behavior. They are saying the next book is from Tella's POV.Fun. (hide spoiler)] 
 Julian ,even though generic stereotype, is cute. Adorable, I'd say.At least his character is more interesting than Tella. 
 The big bad Legend is confusing. His backstory does not provide answers about his current behavior nor does it give any idea about his mindset. It's frustrating . Same story for her Dad. There's no reason for his lunatic behavior. 
 Other characters were just introduced as needed . 
 The magical element was not explained at all. 
 But overall, it was an entertaining read."
4,"*Thank you to NetGalley for providing a copy for me to read and review!* 
 This was a really sweet book! I've never been one for romances or the whole ~book boyfriend~ thing, but I just adore Pax. He is just fabulous. He is happy and funny and sweet and lovely, but he is also scared because of a disability that he is sure will scare off any potential love interests. 
 Nikki is trying to recover from the fallout of the part she played in a really gross cyberbullying incident. While she was not the main perpetrator, she took the entire fall and basically lost everything she cared about in life. Along with meeting and falling for Pax, she befriends a girl in her new school who was the victim of a similar cyberbullying incident. 
 I love how this book offers second chances. Nikki really isn't a terrible human being, but she has to fight for the people she loves to respect and trust her. She meets Pax, who forgives her past sins and allows her to really move on. Things are a bit trickier with Sam initially, but both of those characters were wonderful catalysts for helping her heal and learn and make better choices in her life. 
 Swoon-y romance isn't normally my thing, but this really was a sweet book. I enjoyed it, and I would definitely read other books by this author - especially if she has more fabulous Pax-esque characters rolling around in her head! :-)"
4,"After reading the first book in this series early this year I couldn't wait to get back to this series. Made to Be Broken is just as good as the first book, maybe even a bit better. It's another story, another investigation, but there are also plot lines that continue and develop more in this book. And probably will continue in the next book too. 
 In Made to Be broken things get a bit more personal, a case reminds Nadia of her own sister and she starts to investigate. Then Jack comes along and helps. There are leads to be chased, research to be done and murders to be solved. I really enjoyed this book and it makes me reconsider my reluctance to pick up 'horror' books, because while this book has some parts that could be called a bit scary, I really enjoyed it and just wanted to read more and figure it all out. I like how I kept guessing and trying to figure out how it all worked out together with Nadia. The end doesn't tie things up as nicely as I would've hoped, but luckily I have the third book to read next. I love Kelley Armstrong her writing style and I just wanted to keep reading. 
 Nadia is a great character and I liked reading more about her and the lodge she calls home. I liked learning more about her and we see a bit more of the side characters too. I really like Jack too, how he speaks in short sentences and how characteristicaly he is. There also is a bit romance, but it's really on the back burner. And while I like a slow romance, this one went a bit too slow even for me. And I wish Nadia would just recognize her feelings for Jack and act on them, but that's not what happens. I do like Quinn too, but there is just something he's missing. I keep routing for Nadia and Jack. 
 To conclude: Made to be Broken is another great installment in this series. Some plot lines that where started in the first book are continued, but mostly it's a new murder mystery to be solved. I really enjoyed this book and wanted to keep reading. I love Kelley her writing style! This book has great characters and I love how they feel real and I liked getting to know more about the characters. The romance is done really well and slow. Next up is the third book in this series and I can't wait to see how it all get's wrapped up."
3,"I'm just going to start off by saying this is not a menage. There is no threesomes or three-way relationships happening in this book. The cover and even blurb might making it seem that way, but it is not. 
 Alright, when I started the book I actually hadn't read the blurb and immediately hated Riley and if he was going to be the one for Vin (which I guess he kinda was) I was going to abandon this book. Nearly did until we got to the end and I appreciated the ending so much. 
 The whole power exchange relationship in this one didn't work as well as in the first one and I kinda found it really out of place. The book, in my opinion, would have been a lot better if that whole aspect of there relationship was taken out. Frankly, the boys had enough to deal with without adding a new dynamic to there sex lives. 
 Shane sucked int his book, hated him more then Riley. There was no reason for the way he treated Patrick, absolutely none and in the end I don't understand why he did the thing he did. 
 Either way, it was a good follow up to The Square Peg and I enjoyed it but nowhere near loved it. I'd still recommend it to anyone who read the previous book and enjoyed it."
2,"Excellent idea, poorly executed. 
 If the author put half as much effort into building authentic characters as he did into getting the science right this may have been readable. 
 Instead the dialogue and characters are cookie cutter, emotions fall flat, interactions felt trite, the hackneyed and inauthentic dialogue flabbergasted me. 
 This is a big problem- character development. NONE occurs. This is fiction 101. Your character must develop- not necessarily in a good way- a slow decent into insanity is fine. But they must develop. The psychological impact of spending years alone is huge, add to that the extremely common experience of space depression, utter isolation and almost certain death. No one makes jokes for two years. And to the imbiciles saying he probably felt that way but didn't write about it- wtf? This. Is. A. Novel. Novels involve emotions and character development. So disappointing. 
 The shifting character POV, unexplained changes between 1st and 3rd person and weird interjections such as the full history of the tent material from its construction point on earth were irritating. Again this is fiction 101. 
 Humour that isn't funny is death to a novel-happened so often I was cringing... but then I saw a review where someone said they laughed out loud at ""gay probe"" so maybe I'm not the intended audience? Maybe 12 year olds are? 
 Worst of all- it was often boring. The science bits were interesting- everything else was boring. I wish I had read a non-fiction book on physics, space travel or potato farming instead."
4,"This seventh story of Chronicles of Nick is confusing. It's the usual ""one day in Nick Gautier's life"", when everything is happening and at the end you can't believe it was just one day, not even 24 hours. 
 This time around someone, somehow deflates Nick's Malachai's powers and Nick sees all kinds of strange flash back or flash forwards about the people around him or about himself. He can't be sure anymore whether those flashes are real or possibilities. He gets useful information about person's pasts and about surprises from future. And as usual he keeps collecting new ally from surprising places, he's collecting then like stray dogs :). 
 But there is somebody who wants to change the future even more than Nick and he and his ally are two steps ahead of Nick. 
 As always, it's an interesting story but now I'm questioning all I have known about Nick and Ambrosius so far and I'm looking for a book about Simi and Madoc ;)."
4,"If you like New Adult angst, you will love this book. It is New Adult in the best ways 
 The problems our heroes have a real ones with have to do with owning sexuality, still being tied to parents for good and bad, and healing. 
 This is a hot read with heroes who fall in love with each other hard. 
 There is a lot of pain to get through but you will root for them. 
 I like less drama in my love stories but I still really liked this book even though I wanted a richer HEA, 
 Cousins is a really good writer!"
5,"This book is addicting, thrilling and magically creative! 
 You will want to finish this book in one sitting, and you'll want to reread it again and again! Karpov Kinrade does an excellent job at creating an epic sequel that leaves readers wanting more. You wouldn't expect a sequel to be better than the original, but KK keeps building on their story and leaving me breathless! 
 Arianna is a wonderfully built character who has a personality and a mind of her own. She isn't your cookie cutter YA or adult novel star, she's an earth shattering, beautifully written character! She has many layers and will surprise you on her journey! 
 The twists and turns of the plot will make any reader not want to put it down. This story is anything but boring, and that made me love it! I hate a story that slows down and creates a sense of boredom, this story makes sure you don't have that! 
 Reading this book is important for the series and I would suggest reading the first novel if you are going to pick this series up. This book contains important information regarding background history of our realms and main character, but it needs the background of the first novel to serve it justice. 
 Five out of five stars! Karpov Kinrade wows again! A must read for fantasy lovers!"
3,"3.5 stars 
 If I'm ever going to Italy, I'm gunna re-read this book and note all the spots mentioned here down. Maybe I'll find love, but if not, there's always straciatella."
4,"Two young men have been friends since practically birth. A tragedy affects one, and the other was weak and hurt the first. Their families push them to reconcile, and the wronged man struggles to let go of his hatred. The story takes place in Berlin. 
 Typos: see notes."
3,"I feel so ... empty. I wasn't affected enough by The Master Butchers Singing Club to call it heartbreaking (except for the scant descriptions of Wounded Knee), but every event and interaction seemed filled with a sort of dull, stifled joylessness. Even the ""happy"" times held a foreboding that something terrible was about to happen. That's perhaps unsurprising, considering the main characters Delphine and Fidelius have learned to suppress their emotions as a result of being a motherless child raised by a chronic alcoholic and surviving the horrors of WWI, respectively. But readers who are hoping for a satisfying emotional release by the end will, I think, be disappointed. As usual, though, Erdrich is an adept storyteller; the characters are believable and sympathetic and the twists held my interest."
2,"Despite reading more than a few negative reviews of THE JEWEL, I was somehow convinced that I would love it so I had to try it for myself. I probably should have listened because they were obviously on to something. That doesn't mean my feelings about the book were all negative though, as I enjoyed some aspects. 
 If I had to summarize this novel I would say it's an obvious mix of WITHER and THE SELECTION. Although the plot is somewhat unique on its own, it combines elements from the two books that easily reminded me of them, especially WITHER because of the surrogate/reproduction focus. 
 ""Hope is a precious thing, isn't it,"" she says. ""And yet, we don't really appreciate it until it's gone."" 
 Very similar to how I get hooked on reality TV shows, this book really caught my attention and hooked me in at the beginning. I couldn't help but be swept up in the drama and glitz and glam. Plus the writing flows really well. I also wanted to know more about this world and the surrogacy system that was never fully explained but no resentment or anything *eye twitch*. However, things went quickly downhill towards the middle of the book. 
 As soon as the first hint of romance showed up (not even a hint because it's like BAM! Romance time NOW) I was like: 
 Except it was more like ""please noooooo,"" because the romance really brought the book down for me. If you ever needed a true definition of YA Insta-Love, look no further, this it it. The ANGST, I swear. Not to mention the introduction of a love interest makes the main character's personality totally flip-she begins to make the absolute worst decisions. Aimee's awesome review on The Social Potato goes into detail about this and I definitely recommend her review if you want to know more about the romance. 
 Despite all this, I will be checking out the sequel-partly because of a HUGE cliffhanger again, no resentment or anything *nervous laughter* and partly because I think the plot has potential and room for future development."
4,"A thrilling conclusion to the series, Collide was a fantastic YA read. It had secrets, betrayals, and a final battle that didn't hold back. I thought it was a great way to end the Taking series. 
 Ari continued to grow stronger and smarter in this book. She went up against tyrants and refused to give up no matter the circumstances. I already liked her and this book just reinforced how much of a badass she was. 
 Jackson was wonderful as always. He was strong, yet sweet, and determined to always be there for Ari. I just adored him. 
 The romance was perfect. Ari and Jackson are so great together, stronger as a team and always supportive of each other. I was happy with how things turned out with them. 
 The plot moved quickly, keeping me interested all the way through. There were plenty of thrills along the way, a few surprises, and, of course, the epic final battle. I really enjoyed the story and the ending was perfect. 
 Collide was an excellent end to the series and it definitely didn't disappoint. YA lovers, this is a series worth checking out. 
 *I received a complimentary copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review"
5,"Wow. 
 It took two book groups and multiple recommendations for me to actually pick this one up because it's not my genre. I've never been into thrillers. But wow, I'm glad I did. 
 This tells the story of a marriage. And a mystery. I can't say much for fear of giving something away, but it has a lot of things I like in a book: beautiful prose, gender issues, intrigue. 
 It starts out fairly innocuously but quickly moves into the mystery part of the story. I'm not used to the genre, so the turns the book took really shocked me. I just HAD to finish it and as quickly as possible once I got about halfway. 
 It ends the only way it could have ended. I like that. 
 P.S. (view spoiler)[Is it bad that I found myself identifying with the most sociopathic character? (hide spoiler)]"
4,"Oh man, this shit was CRAZY."
5,This book was really great. It started off a little slow but after the story took off when she met Edward. This is a great read for fans of The Unidentified Redhead and Love Unscripted
4,"""I should have been born a girl."" 
 First and foremost, I should mention I am a cis woman. My review is limited by my own experiences, which has unfortunately not included actual face-to-face contact with a trans person. 
 Now that that's out of the way, I did think If Was Your Girl was a teensy unrealistic. But, BUT-- *dodges flying tomato* not the kind you think. My beef is with how easily Amanda is accepted into the social fold. First day at school and she's already got two male admirers and four instant girl buddies, without her making a genuine effort to interact with people. 
 Remember Bella Swan? Remember that iconic line from that Twilight parody movie: ""Wow, you look pretty frigid and boring! Wanna go to prom?"" 
 Zero to hero, no time flat. 
 Everything else I adored. There are characters in all shades of grey. It's not LGBTQIA+ Rainbow Squad versus homophobes. Most of them are somewhere in between, transitioning, learning, like in real life. Amanda's parents love and accept her, but it also takes them time to adjust to having a daughter instead of a son. You also have someone from a very strict religious family, a semi-closeted lesbian, a bisexual woman who makes mistakes, and a boy finding his place on the gender spectrum. 
 Plus, special shout-out to the use of positive female relationships in the context of support systems. 
 The ending is perfect. It doesn't end with a traditional happily ever after, but rather the promise of one. A promise that transgender people deserve fairytale endings just as much as everyone else. 
 ""You can have anything,"" she said, ""once you admit you deserve it."""
4,"My thoughts: 
 Omg, I really should not start like that but I just have to tell you all how I felt when I turned the page and realized this book ended. It was with shock because I wanted more and instead there was this huge cliffhanger that I can't tell you about. I can just say that it is really exciting, scary, horrible and just great. She is an evil author and I seriously want book 4 right now. 
 But ok that was the end; I need to go back first. Shiarra and Chaz go on a vacation so she can get friendly with his pack. I never liked Chaz that much, ok he was a nice boyfriend but I never was on his team and after this, I still am not. Is that bad or good, just read and find out. And poor Shiarra can't catch a break because someone does not want them up there. One of the pack, someone else? Aye that is the mystery in this book and things will heat up. 
 I would love to say why this book had me all fired up, that would mean one huge spoiler. I will just tell you that something will happen and it will be big. It will make you feel things and yes I am being really evil with hints like this but it just had me gripping the book so hard. 
 This book had another feel to it since there other books have had things leading up to a big showdown, while this one had smaller show downs. And it was just as good. 
 I am just being way too mysterious. But ok let me say this. The book had some good action, mystery, insights into Others and more. We meet Royce again, and I do like him because he is always the quiet gentleman in a way. He does not take a step towards her if she does not want it. I think he could be a very good friend, and ally is always good to have. 
 I just love how easy these are to read and the pages just fly by. 
 Conclusion: 
 *bites nails* When does book 4 come out? I need to know what happens! The thing is that even if everything ended kind of quiet there is still this big elephant in the room. I will certainly read book 4 and I hope you will do to."
5,"This book doesn't have a happy ending at all, but this is one of the cases that I don't mind at all. It seemed like a fitting ending. It did take me a while to get into the book, but things really started to take off in the second section of the book."
4,I liked The Reptile Room even more than The Bad Beginning! Lemony Snicket has such a unique writing style and voice. Violet is still my favorite character; she's wonderful. I tooootally recommend the audiobook!
3,"This book got better as it went on. I particularly enjoyed Sym's commentary on love, isolation, and her connection with Titus. I can see why the Printz committee selected it, and why (adult) librarians enjoy it - but, I'm curious as to what teens think of it...? 
 Sym thinks she's taking a mini-break with her uncle to Paris. However, Uncle Victor has different plans in mind. Instead, they end up in Antarctica, where they undergo a franctic search for the mythic ""Symme's Hole."" 
 Shyness: ""For some crime committed by my ancestors in the dark and forgotten days, I came into the world already tarred and feathered. With shyness. It hurts terribly - every bit as much as hot tar choking every pore- and I wish I could be ride of it. But it hurts a lot less than having someone try and peel the shyness off. That's like being flayed alive."" pg 56. 
 ""But I forgot to speak outloud, so Sigurd didn't answer. Obviously."" pg 83. 
 ""It's true: Everyone needs a reason to stay alive - someone who justifies your existence. Someone who loves you. Not beyond all reason. Just loves you. Even just shows an interest. Even somene who doesn't exist, or isn't yours. No, no! They don't even have to love you! They just have to be there to love! Target for your arrows. Magnetic Pole to drag on you compass needle and stop it spinning and spinning and tell you where you're heading and...Someone to soak up all the yearning..."" pg. 325 
 Like It: Sym, her interior monologue, 
 Leave It: Antarctica? The premise? No, I guess not..it's what makes the book unique.

4,"I didn't have any expectations going into this book, and I was so pleasantly surprised that I loved it the way I did. I was engrossed from the beginning of the story, when poor Renee finds her parents dead in the woods, to the bitter and shocking ending that left me reeling. This book was set at a boarding school, which is a setting that I really love when it's done well, which it was in this case. The teachers and students are all beyond smart and each has a compelling personality that draws you in. 
 Renee was a fantastic main character. She was smart and resourceful. Even dealing with the shocking death of her parents, she is strong and stands up for what she believes in. When she moves to the mysterious Godfried Academy and finds that there are things there that might lead her to answers about what happened to her parents she is unstoppable in her quest for answers. Dante is the classic male lead, handsome and mysterious and everything a girl is looking for. He was completely devoted to Renee from the moment they got together. Although he was the classic male lead, he was also charming in his own right and a lot of fun to read. 
 Overall, I really enjoyed this book and I think a lot of you will as well. It had a mystery that had me guessing through the whole book. The paranormal element in this book was one of the biggest mysteries, so I won't give it away, but I will say that it was really unique. I'm really looking forward to reading more from this author!"
3,"Yeah, this book was basically about YOLO. Except the main characters were immature, thought stealing gum from a convenience store which has a manager who earns a LIVING for his family from that kinda stuff, was so cool, etc. Because YOLO right. Yeah. No. Unless you're desperate/starving, stealing should never be an option. I didn't like how the author portrayed this. I didn't like how the author portrayed a lot of things. 
 Bailey seemed to think that living life fully meant living carelessly. I mean it's great to live feeling at peace with the world, but just doing stupid shit specifically for the sake of manufacturing ""memories"" for later was just dumb in my opinion. 
 I dunno, maybe I'm just too goody two shoes. 
 The reason this book gets 3 stars is because those things aside, the writing was compelling enough to keep me reading. That is all. 
 P.S. yolo."
5,"Tethered is a beautiful tale of two characters that I love. I fell in love with both Donya and Emmet. Donya, to me, is such a breath of fresh air. She is makes mistakes and takes responsibilities for those mistakes. She is strong but still leans on others. She likes who she is. That is probably the most refreshing part, to read a teenage girl who respects herself and has her own thoughts and opinions. Donya has a good head on her shoulders and does not let herself be swayed when she believes in something. She is flawed and grows from those flaws. We see her grow up, make mistakes, and flourishes due to her steadfastness. 
 Emmet is such a well defined and developed character that I can picture him so clearly in my mind. Emmet makes me want to believe in soul mates. He has a good heart but shows what happens when you fall in love but haven't grown up yet. 
 Tethered is one of those stories I feel like re-read at least once a year. It gives me such joy to read a book that is beautiful and heartbreaking, sad and hopeful all at the same time."
4,"The star of this story is Alaska-unrelenting dark, frigid,silent, cruel, lonely, vast, monochrome, perilous. So many adjectives. If only the story was about that. Other reviewers are spot on about the implausibility of events. Ridiculous. But I liked the deaf daughter perspective. Three and a half juddering stars"
2,"What it claims to be is, Romeo and Juliet. Just reversed, less dramatic and we all get a happy ending. 
 The story is set in a small town in Mississippi called ""Magnolia Branch"" where two families, the Cafferty and Marsdens have had a long history with one another. Contrary to Shakespeare's Capulets and Montagues, the Cafferty and Marsden families are pretty much inseparable. So the perfect opportunity to unite the two families arises when a baby girl and boy were born at the same time. While their families are planning table linens for their future wedding, Jemma Cafferty and Ryder Marsden would rather strangle each other.

 Now, while I do not think that Magnolia is a terrible book, I certainly do not find it memorable in any way either. It was definitely a fast easy read with cute moments but I felt that that was all it was. Of course, about two-thirds of the book was about the hurricane that crashed through Magnolia Branch. It was considered understandable since the whole plot was centred on the storm that changed everything. It was the storm that unravelled misunderstood feelings and situations. 
 However I felt that most of the drama, such as Jemma's sister's situation, Patrick and the college applications felt half-heartedly written. I was really looking forward to seeing Jemma and her parents discuss about her decisions to study film and leave for NYU but it never really did happen. It all just felt rushed at the end of the book and the issue was quickly resolved. Also, I found it quite purposeless to introduce so many secondary characters (Ben, Tanner, etc.) into the story if they were not going bring a driving force to the narration. I get that it is suppose to resemble back to the writing of Romeo and Juliet but it made no sense to me if the characters were only to make two appearances. 
 While there is nothing to dislike about the two main characters, Jemma and Ryder seemed a little bit too dry as characters. Jemma is the average looking girl who is also a cheerleader while Ryder is the star football player who is also a top student. They were cute together and had significant amount of chemistry, but as a character alone I really could not care less. It was also hard for me to find their passion believable like Ryder's for astronomy and Jemma's film making. 
 The only discovery I have made is about the state of Mississippi. Prior to the book, I do not have a sense of how Mississippi looks like at all. But, after some quick Google searches on landscape images, I think it is such a beautiful place. So my entire impression of the book's setting was breath taking and fresh with lush greeneries and wide fields. 
 In general, a very harmless cute romance book that you would want to read on a lazy day at the beach."

 First Thought when Finished: A Lady by Midnight by Tessa Dare had all the feels and smiles! 
 Overall Thoughts: Tessa did it again! I loved Kate and Thorne's love story. I knew these two were destined to be a great match when Kate was a bit more sure of herself on the inside and Thorne appeared very sure of himself on the outside. Thorne stepping up to ""pretend"" to be Kate's fiance while they figured out if her new found family was legit was fun, interesting, and intriguing. I loved Thorne's back story. I dare you not to swoon after him. I loved Kate's determination to make him see his worth. I loved the ladies of Spindle Cove making sure that this turned out exactly as it should. All around another great entry in the series. 
 Audio Thoughts: 
 Narrated By Carolyn Morris / Length: 10 hrs and 51 mins 
 Carolyn did an outstanding job with Kate and Thorne! These are really good on audio and well worth the time to listen too1 
 Final Thoughts: Tessa really does knock it out of the park with Kate and Thorne (his first name is Samuel but his last name fits him so well)!"
3,"Probably one of the most accessible Austen's brings my reading of her works to a close. 
 Emma wasn't too bad actually. Of course, there's the usual love triangle and convoluted misunderstandings of intent. But with a smaller range of characters than some of her others, I found this to be much easier to follow. The characters were more memorable for that too. 
 The eponymous heroine is of course stubborn, proud and can't spot the obvious when it lives, walks and breathes right in front of her. But she loves assuming that everyone else around her has exactly that problem and tries her best to help them out. Occasionally these episodes, particularly with Harriet, have faintly amusing consequences. 
 I welcomed the focus on one particular character after all the rest of her novels spread the character development across a range of them. But it confirmed (again!) that Austen is one-trick pony. It's a good trick if you like it, but it's a bit yawn-worthy otherwise, much like Wilbur Smith or Dan Brown. 
 If you've never tried Austen before though, Emma would be a good starting point."
3,"I was expeting something more. I can't deny this was a great ending and I really enjoyed with exception of some few escene or well the sex scenes they were some meh for me. I don't know I didn't enjoyed reading the scenes plays the virgen card annoys me sometimes (and this was one of that times). 
 HowIt was unwrapped everything after the second book It was interesting. But I don't know part of me feels that some parts were unnecessary and annoying for me. I am not sure If was well played that Stella character. And how some murders were involved I don't know. I didnp't enjoyed the end like I was expecting and this is a problem with some suspense book that when everything is unwrapped doesn't feels great and sometimes is dissapointed. 
 SPOILERS TIME-**** 
 I checked three days ago and I was reading that in the new books Mara is going to be the villain or something is wrong with here and she wants power now. And that was a good thing to know because I am thinking that some things about Mara happens like happen in this book due the new books that the author was planning publish in a future. 
 I am sorry but I didn't click with Noah for me he was a very generical character and I was thinking that since the first book but reading the third and the last book in this trilogy I can afirm my feel. Now Mara looks for me is a bit like Adelina from The Young Elites and Ruby from The Darkest Minds she is a mix between that both characters. I am sorry but sometimes she was super annoying for me in this book. 
 It was a good story? Yes. And I like it but I didn't enjoyed this book like the previous~ 
 3 STARS!"
5,"This book was very easy to read and a great story. I read it in an afternoon. It's 1996, Emma and Josh have had a non-existent relationship since he put the moves on her 6 months prior. Emma's dad sends her a guilt present of a computer and Josh's mom insists he take over an AOL online disc since they don't ""do"" the internet. Emma loads it up and BAM she's looking 15 years into the future at her own facebook page, but she isn't pleased with what she sees. Emma and Josh start changing what they do and see how it affects the future."
5,This was such a fun and sweet end to this trilogy. I really enjoyed it all and i definitley will be reading more of ellie's books
4,"All things must come to an end, and unfortunately, The Sandman is among them. The book feels more like epilogue than true ending, the previous installment (The Kindly Ones) being a bit of a more proper ending. All the same, I must say that the series would be lesser without The Wake. 
 In the afterward Neil Gaiman writes that the series is about saying goodbye.. and more than anything else, I feel that that is an accurate summation. The characters learn, things change, and once choices are made they can't be undone. The Sandman as a whole has a lot to say about life, about the human condition. It has a lot to say about how to better oneself, and the nature of responsibility. 
 I can say without a doubt, that I feel the better for having read all of this. It's a series of stories and a cast of characters that will stay with me for a long, long time. What a gift Gaiman has given us."
3,"The King is dying and the Princess, Raesinia, is beset on all sides by the spies of the Minister of Information, Orlanko. Marcus d'Ivoire, Janus bet Vhalnich and Winter Ihernglass are back from the war in Khandar ready to support the new Queen. Will they be enough? 
 This is the second in the ""Shadow Campaigns"" trilogy and I enjoyed this one more than ""The Thousand Names"" as there was much less emphasis on the fighting and more on the personalities. Orlanko is a great character, thoroughly unlikeable and full of horrible schemes whereas Raesinia, who I also thought was well written, has much more about her than may first appear. 
 I did feel there was more character development this time and the story did progress more quickly because there was much less description of the battles and the arrangements leading up to them. Nevertheless, I still did feel there was a lot of violence which didn't really add to the story, and it could probably have been 3/4 in length if the extraneous bits had been left out! 
 Nevertheless, I enjoyed hearing more about Janus, Marcus and Winter, and I will definitely read the last part of the trilogy so that I can see how the story finishes. An easy read, but maybe one that became a bit too bogged down in unnecessary details in parts."
3,"The Key (Bluebeard) by Rachel Hawkins - 3/5 
 I really liked this despite some qualms; it was clever and a nice modern twist on Bluebeard. I do wish it had been a bit longer because you don't really have a feel for the characters. (If you want a longer retelling, look at Sarah Cross's Killing Me Softly.) 
 Figment (Puss in Boots) by Jeri Smith-Ready -3.75/5 
 I'd never before read a Puss in Boots retelling, but this was good. Loved the fresh applications of the story and how Smith-Ready still carried the same vibe. Possibly one of the most well-written contributions to the entire anthology. 
 The Twelfth Girl (12 Dancing Princesses) by Malinda Lo - 3.5/5 
 This was good, bordering on great. Certain aspects worked well (location, diversity) but it was kinda.. flat at times? Very recognizable as a 12 Dancing Princesses but with an added air of creepitude I really enjoyed. Again, a story that would have benefited from a longer length. 
 The Raven Princess by Jon Skrovon - 2.75/5 
 A little bit grim at first, but also can feel a bit... treacly? A little... saccharine? The ending was neat, but a bit too pat and easy for an anthology named Grim. 
 Thinner Than Water (Cat-Skin) by Saundra Mitchell - 5/5 
 I freaking loved this. It brought all the grit and grimness I had been waiting for. I was unsettled by it (as I am by the Cat/Donkey Skin fairy tale in general) but thought it was GREAT how Mitchell ended it. Melura is a badass character and one I'd like to see in a full-length novel. Just maybe focused on a different fairy tale. It definitely made me curious to seek out Mitchell's novels. 
 Before the Rose Bloomed (The Snow Queen) by Ellen Hopkins - n/a 
 Skipped because verse does not work for me outside of poetry. 
 Beast/Beast (Beauty and the Beast) by Tessa Gratton -3/5 
 A decent retelling, but again, one sorely lacking the grimness promised. I appreciated Gratton's version of the characters, but didn't overly care about or invest in them. 
 The Brothers Piggett (The Three Little Pigs) by Julie Kagawa - 4/5 
 Fun, clever, almost as dark and twisty as I wanted it to be. Kagawa does a The Three Little Pigs a new kind of justice and it is so fun and awesome and GRIM. 
 Also now I want pie. 
 Untethered (The Shroud) by Sonia Gensler -2.5/5 
 This is one I didn't know the original story so it's hard for me to compare and judge in that regard. However, has some good prose and I liked it? I don't have much else to say. 
 Better (The Pied Piper) by Shaun David Hutchinson - 3/5 
 uhh.. sure, this is a Pied Piper retelling. If I squint and don't focus too hard. It definitely seems moreso towards the end, but most of this story does not gel with the whole ""fairy tale"" theme. It was grim yes, but also felt so misplaced here. Also would have been stronger without a romance. 
 Light It Up (Hansel & Gretel) by Kimberly Derting - 3/5 
 Decent, but I never really manage connect to Derting's writing or her storytelling methods just don't work for me. Add a shorter length and I was never really gonna go for for this one. 
 Sharper Than a Serpent's Tongue (Diamonds and Toads) by Christine Johnson - 2/5 
 I hard a hard time with this? It just didn't connect with me and failed to do anything really new or interesting with the established fairy tale besides using it in a modern setting. (Also Jewels in Killing Me Softly and Tear You Apart is a far more exciting example of a modern version for a Diamonds and Toads retelling.) 
 A Real Boy (Pinocchio) by Claudia Gray -3.5/5 
 Surprisingly, I really liked this because of the romance. Buuuut I am running out things to say about it. Well-written, engaging and a pretty good length. 
 Skin Trade (The Robber Bridegroom) by Moira McEntire - 1/5 
 No. 
 Beauty and the Chad (Beauty and the Beast) by Sarah Rees Brennan - 3.5/5 
 This worked better than it should have? Some parts didn't gel as well as they could, but it was pretty amusing (after all, it is Sarah Rees Brennan). Though, again, not very grim. 
 The Pink (The Carnation) by Amanda Hocking - 2/5 
 I've been complaining about length the whole time but The Pink had the opposite issue of most here -- it felt too long. It doesn't help that I've never truly enjoyed a Hocking novel; her style just does not work for me. 
 Sell Out (Snow White) by Jackson Pearce - 3/5 
 Decent, but not engrossing the way the better stories have been. It fits in the anthology and Pearce is a good storyteller, but, once again, majorly hampered by the lack of length. 
 Final thoughts: Grim is a mixed bag and while the theme is only carried by some of the stories, it can be a fun read. It also made me curious to seek out longer stories from Saundra Mitchell because she basically won the anthology and reaffirmed my love for Sarah Rees Brennan. Julie Kagawa also reminded me why sometimes her books and characters can be so much unexpected fun.

4,"It's not mystery that I adore Kingfisher/Vernon's down-to-earth, sensible protagonists, so of course I adored Bryony from the get go. And of course she would find her perfect match in a witty and sarcastic Beast. 
 While the story is in great part more humorous and light-hearted compared to the previous Seventh Bride, it takes a real quick turn for the dark towards the end (the corridor of roses will haunt me for a while). 
 Only 4 stars as I was a little let down by the resolution, though it's the thin line between ""perfection"" and a mere ""extremely good""."
5,"I don't like cliffhangers. Let's just get that out of the way first. I don't like to read them and I try not to write them (so far I haven't. Never say never, right?) This is an intriguing tale. The POVs written by these two writers were almost synchronized. I loved the mystery. I loved Charlie's darkness and I loved Silas' light. I loved the surrealness of two people trying to piece their lives and their relationship back together. I want to read more. A few things toward the end started to bother me; mainly, the incongruence of the characters started to show through. I think that comes from two writers working on the same project from different perspectives and male and female POVs, but it wasn't enough to take me out of the story and not for too long. It ""is"" hard to keep cohesion. But I loved it anyway. Can't wait for more about these two."
4,"I like the books, but they are definitely for kids. The feel of the books, the dialogue, everything. Best way I can describe it is corny. It was very very corny. Reminds me of the jokes and acting on the shows they play on the Disney channel.. which is all good for the younger generation. I just hate watching it cuz it's so freakin corny."
4,"I received a free copy of the audiobook from the publisher through Audiobook Jukebox in exchange for an honest review. 
 When Helen MacDonald's father unexpectedly died, she was devastated. As an experienced falconer, she chose an unusual outlet for her grief; she decided to raise and train a goshawk. If you are like me, you probably never heard of a goshawk or you lump goshawks into the category of predator birds that fly around and hunt things like mice -- just like a robin or sparrow, but maybe bigger. But, MacDonald quickly teaches us that these are not your ordinary birds, or even your typical hawk. 'In real life, goshawks resemble sparrowhawks the way leopards resemble house cats. Bigger, yes. But bulkier, bloodier, deadlier, scarier, and much, much harder to see.' What we learn is that these birds are instinctive, vicious, and incredibly wild, and in working with her Goshawk, MacDonald teeters on the edge of retaining her own social self. I was amazed and fascinated about the amount of dedication and work it takes to train a hawk. She gives up her job, her home, and any semblance of a social life. 
 In parallel with describing her fascinating trials with her Goshawk Mabel, MacDonald analyzes T.H. White's (author of The Once and Future King) book The Goshawk where he recounts his efforts to train a goshawk. For me, this was the most painful part of this beautiful memoir. Unlike MacDonald, White is completely inept when it comes to training his bird and he occasionally takes out his frustration with cruel and vicious attacks on his goshawk. In addition, he goes completely off topic and describes his own problems as a closet homosexual, makes allusions about his cruelty to young boys, and how his parents were sadistic and completely dysfunctional. These parts of the book were unpleasant to say the least and I have to wonder why MacDonald included this analysis. I was already convinced by her work with Mabel that raising a hawk is not an easy task. Seeing White's failure did not enhance the story and I have to say that one of my big complaints about this book is that I found these sections to be a distraction and detracted from the story. 
 But, overall, the writing and raw emotion of this story is magnificent. I found my feelings mirroring MacDonald's experiences as I listened to her recount her story. When Mabel wasn't flying, I felt despair and frustration and by the end of this book, I had an appreciation for this wild animal and admiration for anyone undertaking the task of training a goshawk. The audiobook is narrated by the author, which is generally NOT a good listening experience. But, this was definitely the exception. MacDonald has a beautiful voice and was perfect for this memoir. Her prose is poetic and there were passages that were so beautiful to listen to. Definitely a recommendation for people who enjoy memoirs and nature lovers."

 MC2: Misha 
 BDSM books are always the hardest for me to rate and review because of the wide range in this specific field, and personal taste. 
 I think this book will be a good choice for a first intro into BDSM. This book is not hard-cor BDSM but ""BDSM with a lot of leeway"" and a dom who takes excellent after care with his sub. 
 There were a lot going on in this book and a lot of history and past experience with family drama. 
 Misha 
 A 45 year old professor, a fencing teacher and a dom in the BDSM lifestyle. He is bi and was married 3 times 2 wives and 1 husband. I struggled with his character especial as the dom in this relationship. I like my Dom's ALL ALPHA and completely in control. I just struggled to connect with Misha. 
 Ryan 
 A 26 year old gay student who loves to paint and have a lot of family issues and a crazy mom. A bit arrogant desperate to belong and thanks to his fucked up childhood doesn't believe in love or marriage."
3,"La vie est une longue fleuve. Well, not necessarily, but I kept thinking of that phrase (actually a film title - of a very good film) while I was reading this book. Lord it was longue! Or at least felt it! 
 Thinking about it, a lot of the drama points happen off camera. One dud's mum used to whip him when he came out as gay. By the time the book begins, he has been living in the basement of the house of the family for years, going off to gay bars occasionally. The car accident happens off screen. Meeting and falling in love with Rich happens off screen. Alex telling Nathan she's pregnant happens off screen. Other significant events I've already forgotten happen off screen. 
 At first when reading I had trouble attaching names to people - somehow the characters weren't well delineated at the outset. And you had a lot of not terribly nice people doing things they don't really want to do because of stupid social obligation. 
 I also think Nathan, did not do well by his wife or his lover. So the HEA...sigh. Longue fleuve. 
 And it was all weirdly muted. 
 I recall reading Brown's Morning Report books and enjoying them. I tried an Isle of Wight book but wasn't interested enough to pursue it I have her summer books coming up on my wish list, and I'll have a look when they come up. I guess my relationship with this author's work is ""iffy""."
3,"3.5 stars 
 It's was a nice romance but there was too much New Adult drama and the heroine really got on my nerves. Cole was totally swoon-worthy, yet I wanted him to hove some more edge. 
 Full review is also published on my blog - http://elliereadsfiction.blogspot.com/ 
 This is book 5 in On Dublin Street series. I've read all the books, except book 2, and I'd recommend that you read them in order, though they can be appreciated as standalones as well. 
 I was rather disappointed with Hannah and Marco's story in the Before Jamaica lane this made anxious about Cole's story. I liked it better but still it's not one of my favourites in the series. 
 This was a very sweet, NA romance between a supposedly bad boy hero and a heroine who has sworn off of dangerous men. 
 Cole, whom we met first as a kid in the beginning of the series has grown up to be a fine young man. He is a famous tattoo artist, rough looking, covered in tattoos himself, yet his appearance is totally misleading. He hides a heart of gold and he was the perfect gentleman with everybody. I felt his goodness a bit overdone, too perfect made him bland and far too unrealistic. Still, he was great with his friends and family, and that made him pretty adorable and irresistible. 
 My main issue in the story was Shannon. She was just shallow and judgmental, quick to dismiss Cole as someone unworthy of her time/attention just because of his looks. Even when they overcame their initial misunderstanding, she kept making wrong decisions and some stupid choices which hurt the people who loved her. She did try to make up for her wrongdoings, yet I wasn't convinced she deserved Cole. 
 We see a lot of the previous couples, all with children now. Unlike in the previous novel, here their presence was not overwhelming, but warm and nice. There was the usual craziness surrounding them, together with some touching family moments. 
 Overall, it was a nice installment in the series, but there was too much artificial drama and angst. All the happy times and the hot chemistry between Cole and Shannon led to just a 3.5 star rating for me. 
 We meet Shannon's brother, Logan, in this story and he will be the hero in the next installment of the series. The blurb for his story is really intriguing and I can't wait to read it next year."
5,"I wavered midway through this book on what kind of rating I would give it. But the ending was so totally perfect (in that it's not the perfect, fairytale ending) that it's getting the full five stars. What I love most about this book is that it's not about LGBT teens and their drama, it's about humans and their drama, and some of the main characters happen to be LGBT. It's a key difference for me but perhaps not entirely clear. Let me explain. Look at most of HGTV's series. They show people trying to buy a house, fix a house, landscape a yard, renovate something--and a lot of time the people are mixed race couples or same sex couples. But that's never the crux of the story. The crux is that humans have issues with houses and gardens and some of these humans happen to be LGBT or mixed race. It's a very balanced way to show that not only are there couples who aren't like other couples, but also not all same sex couples are the same, any more than all the opposite sex couples are. There are cool couples and annoying ones on every side. 
 Contrast that approach with something like Glee, which I admit I quit watching after mid second season so things might have changed on it. But the reason I quit watching (and I loved Popular, also by Ryan Murphy, so it pained me to stop watching this new version (sometimes too much so) of one of my fav shows) was that I felt like I was being hit over the head with the LGBT anvil. Now, let me be clear. I consider myself a straight ally. I've voted based on the marriage equality issue. I am LGBT friendly. But what this show did that turned me off was make everything about being gay rather than about being human. Guy doesn't like gays? It's because he's gay. Girl is bitchy? She's really gay. Boy is uncomfortable sharing a room with a gay boy who has been nonstop hitting on him? He's a horrible homophobe (would we say the same thing if a girl didn't want to share a room with her straight male stalker?). Instead of having characters they were caricatures and stretched the limits of my credulity. Also my head hurt from being hit with anvils and heavier things (yes, there are heavier things: Ryan Murphy et al found them). 
 Okay, long-ass intro. Apologies. This book I thought might take the Glee route, especially since there is a musical involved, but it didn't. It took the HGTV route, if HGTV had a ""Here's how frakked up our househunters really are"" segment in place of whether or not there's enough money left in the budget to add granite countertops. With the authors writing alternating chapters, which starts out a little jarring but the more you get to know the two Will Graysons (and their way of communicating) the less it bothers until it finally disappears as an issue, you really do get the feeling of two distinct Wills and experiences. You feel their pain, expressed overtly or not so. You sympathize, get frustrated, and ultimately cheer them for being brave in small ways. Because really, that's what life often is. Not saving a busload of kids but making a choice that puts you out there, that risks pain. 
 Also, all this heavy stuff aside, this book is fun. It's a quick read. It's amusing. It's relatable. The lyrics of the songs are hysterical at times. Yes, it's making you think, but it's doing it in a way that is the opposite of anvils. And bravo for that. I'll go look for more books by these guys now, because their collaboration made me want more of them separately or together."
5,"Oh man. This book is, for the lack of a better word, brutal. It battered me and wrung me out and fluffed me out and then wrung me out again and then tossed me to flap in the wind... I don't know why a laundry metaphor is necessary, but that's exactly how I felt. 
 I really hate books about bullying, because I'm just not strong enough to read them. Here comes an irrelevant story about me in 3rd grade, so it's marked with a spoiler if you want to skip over it. 
 (view spoiler)[ 
 I was teased and bullied a little in elementary school. Nowhere near as traumatic as in this novel, because it was mostly name-calling (I was the smallest in my class so they called me Pampers, or my Japanese classmates told me I had ""poop hair"", etc.) Just when my 3rd grade Japanese classmates were gearing up to get really nasty, they started leaving notes in my desk that upset me and I let it show. But then they fucked up. One of the notes said: ""Go back to America and die"". JOKE'S ON YOU, I'M FROM RUSSIA. After that, their efforts were transparent to me and I realized that they don't actually care about me personally. Their ignorance because my shield, and the mean kids eventually gave up. I never did have friends there until I switched schools the next year, but I was okay with that tradeoff. I was very, very lucky. Japanese school bullying is insane, and I basically got off scot-free. Just thinking about the plunge that I almost involuntarily took is scary. And it's that thought that makes it impossible for me to imagine what it's like for the kids who actually fall down that cliff or get dragged into it. 
 (hide spoiler)] 
 I'm not strong enough to read about that intense pain and humiliation. But this book holds you firmly by the shoulder and takes you through one cruel high school hallway anyway. 
 The three main characters are Davidek, Stein and Lorelei, who are freshmen at a private Catholic school known for its extensive hazing. They are bullied and they fight back in their own ways, while struggling to live up their own expectations. Each has problems outside of school. Each has an idea of who they want to be. Some secrets are heartbreaking, especially Stein's. They all do despicable things, and noble things, and stupid things. Each character is fleshed out fully, and their actions follow their personalities completely. Very, very strong work there. And it's not just the main characters. Every single peripheral character is a fully developed person as well. Most of them made me empathize, even after their lowest moment. That's amazing, and I can't believe this is Anthony Breznican's debut. The novel packs a fearsome punch. So I can't wait to get punched by Anthony's word-fist again in the future. 
 Read this book if you have any experience with teasing, humiliation, bullying, abuse, unfair treatment, or dissolution of friendship. It's unflinching without being dramatic. And you will walk away with unforgettable words. 
 -I got and ARC from the publisher in exchange for an honest review-"
5,"Arggh I can't believe how cute this was! I mean, was it the best book plotwise? No, but hell yeah did I love it!"
4,"4 TRAMPLE STARS 
 Now that Jesse has made Ava his in all the ways that he can, he is in trampling mode. Ava's brother, her mother, and anyone else that gets in his way. She belongs to him and he's making it known. They have a few more hurtles to overcome, one being psychotic. But soon everything is as it should be. 
 I was a little disappointed that things went so far before Jesse opened up to tell her everything. I mean he almost cost Ava her life by doing his caveman protection style. Putting himself in danger wasn't any better. 
 The entire series was really good, although I liked the first book the most because it contained a lot of situations that were extremely funny. Although all the forms of sex they named was pretty funny. There was Sleepy Sex, Sense, Reminder, Alfresco Retribution and even Compromise F**k, among many others. 
 Jesse and even Ava, for that matter, were more considerate of Sarah than I would have ever been, but I definitely respected their decision to help her even after all the things she did to them to keep them apart. It was nothing compared to other nut-ball. 
 Great ending, although I wanted more. More with the family. The epilogue brought us back to funny and sexy. 
 I would definitely read more from Jodi. Looking forward to more from her."
5,"It's incredible to think the amount of hours I spent reading this series. Even just this one, I at least tried to read 3 hours daily for the past three weeks. And to be honest I don't regret them. 
 The series wasn't perfect. There were entire chapters without plot development. Entire books even! 
 But it still managed to redeem itself at the end. The epic Last Battle managed to be just as epic as we expected. The unending hordes of Trollocs and everyone fighting till their last breath. 
 I really liked how Rand's death with the Dark one was handled. How time passed slowly for him and we only got to see him at times. I think it gave a bigger impact and reminded the readers were the real fight was going on. 
 I also loved how it gave an ending to everyone. And you could notice the journey they had been through. Even to later characters like Androl. How he came into his powers and accept them and even use the gateways in cool ways during the battle. 
 Logain becoming the sealbreaker. 
 Also, loved how Mat came to save the battle after the generals were attacked. Incredible how he managed to have grown in character enough to save everyone, while still been really immature. 
 Everything obviously wasn't perfect: 
 (view spoiler)[How they've been foreshadowing Rand's death and talking about it, but he actually switched bodies with Moridin. (hide spoiler)] 
 Another thing I didn't like was how we didn't see enough of Nynaeve, she spent the whole time watching out for Rand. Also Perrin hunting Slayer felt like a waste of time. Just something to pass the time while Rand needed him. 
 Nynaeve and Perrin unlike Androl and Logain are main characters and I felt like their story wasn't up to par. 
 Still, incredible great ending. I am still processing everything. Brandon Sanderson did a great job tying up all loose ends. I am sure Robert Jordan is proud. 
 There are no endings, and never will be endings, to the turning of the Wheel of Time. 
 But it was an ending."
3,"Disappointing - started out good, then the little gimmicky repetitious bits just repeated too many times, until they just got annoying, and the story just basically went absolutely nowhere and a week after I'd finished the book, I realised I'd actually completely forgotten I'd even read it, hence only posting it on this book shelf like over a month after I finished it. I just forgot it existed."
4,"YES. 
 YES. 
 YES. 
 thank GOD she FINALLY is going to stand up for herself. god. those moments where she became Lady Hulk were pretty cool but I WANTED MORE. and NOW I HOPE THERE'LL BE MORE. 
 and im not sure whether adam or warner!!! aghhh!! aghhhh!!! whatever. frankly im fine with both. man i hate love triangles. so. much."
5,"This was all kinds of messed up through and through and highly highly enjoyable. It did not unfold to be the kind of book I thought it would be after reading the first few sections 
 (chapters?) 
 My only overall qualm is that this would make an amazing standalone. The YA world could do with a few more standalones in the sci-fi genre. Will I still read the sequels? Youuuu betcha."
3,"What was that?! I'm coming very late to the Hunger Games series, so I know quite a number of spoilers but only superficially without details. Still, I believe i would have reacted this way too even without being spoiled about certain stuff. The pacing and the writing have seriously weakened from the last two. So many things packed into one book... Even the actual rebel infiltration at the Capitol didn't excite me because it was so slow and messily written... Katniss having way too many mental breakdowns at almost every moment with so much detail really drags the book out a lot. With so much interior monologue going on, I would like to read some of what Katniss thinks about Coin, Beetee, Gale, especially Plutarch towards the end, because their actions are very unclear both factually and morally. 
 It's sad that most of the dead rebels didn't get properly remembered. Forget about the silly book at the end that seems more tokenistic than anything, what about how their loved ones reacted? And obviously the ending was rushed and in my opinion, an insult to both Katniss and Peeta individually, and their relationship (however they mean to each other). 
 I think I'm only giving this a three star rating because it still ultimately provoked me to think deeply, and the writing was still pretty exciting at most points, though these exciting parts were mostly sudden surprises and scattered, like for sensational effects, without being well developed..."

 I must bow down to you Mr. Mullin, for it takes quite a bit to get my stomach knotting, and you good sir had done just that. 
 It is hard for me to find a good book with a mail protagonist that i enjoy. Just the feeling of trying to step into shoes that usually are much larger than my own (I have petite feet) is a challenge for myself as a female reader. Gender aside, Alex was an adoring character that had me rooting for him on the sidelines through all his troubles. 
 Though there were parts that seemed a tad slow and the sentence structure was slightly choppy in places, the journey of Alex and Darla surly made up for that. Not only that but you get a little bit of everything in this book: Action, Adventure, Romance. What is not to love about this book? 
 Oh my, do not get me started on that cover. Simply ominous. It's breathtaking and truly had me drawn in. 
 Kudos Mr. Mullin, for you have me swooning over this book not only to my family but pretty much to those who have cursed themselves by talking to me. And I am truly excited to hear that there is going to be a sequel to this book, something that aches to wait for but longing to look forward to."
4,"There will be a warning when spoilers begin 
 There are plenty of good and bad points to mention about this book, so right now I'm just going to say that in spite of those bad points, I really enjoyed this book. The characters are well-formed and the world is original. 
 Patrick Ness writes the book from Todd Hewitt's point of view. But aren't all books written from the main character's point of view? Well, yes, but The Knife of Never Letting Go is really written from his point of view. Todd is a mostly illeterate twelve(thirteen?)-year-old who grew up in a place where knowledge seems to be shunned. So the grammar, spelling, and everything else is exactly what you would expect such a character to be capable of. 
 That kind of writing might bother some people, but I got used to it pretty quickly. The next thing to note is the concept of Noise. It seems every character at the start of the book can hear each other's thoughts. The way Ness weaves this into the story is really interesting. There are also some parts where Noise is shown through big, blotchy fonts, which really emphasises the chaotic nature of Todd's world. 
 The spoilers start here! Beware! 
 So, the bad points. There are a few things in this book I take issue with for a number of reasons. Let's start with the fact that Todd never found out what the history of Prentisstown was until near the end of the book. Until then, he never knew what happened when it was time for somebody to 'become a man'. It's a mystery, and that's all well and good. 
 But here's my question: How is it that Todd doesn't know any of this when he hears the thoughts of everybody he lives with all the time? I know there are parts where he explains that you can't tell the truth from the lies in people's Noise and so on, but I still find it hard to believe. 
 The second problem I had was that, once I reached the end of the book, I still felt like the reason the Mayor was chasing after Todd hadn't really been revealed. The reaosn provided was that if they could make Todd into a killer, they could control anyone. So Todd was the last boy, and their army wouldn't be complete without him. I'm sorry, but that just doesn't strike me as realistic. Are we supposed to believe that Mayor Prentiss wants to send his army to the end of the planet to capture Todd because he's just a serious completionist? 
 My third problem is with Aaron. How frustrating is this guy? He just doesn't die! The problem here is not that Aaron isn't a good bad guy - he's a great bad guy. But for all the time he spends chasing them across New World, we never really find out if he's doing that as part of Mayor Prentiss's master plot or if he's doing it because he's mental. If Todd did kill Aaron, would Mayor Prentiss have won? Would Mayor Prentiss even have known? (I should mention that I haven't read the second in this series yet, so if this is answered there, I take it all back.) 
 And by this point, had we totally forgotten that Spackle Todd stabbed? If the point of the book was Todd trying to escape becoming a killer, didn't that ship kind of sail when he did this? The Spackle are shown to be sentient and intellegent beings, whether they speak or not, so shouldn't killing one of them count? 
 Okay, so now that that's all off my chest, I want to emphasise, again, that I did enjoy this book. Like I said before, the world was original and the characters were good. Todd was introduced as uneducated, easily frustrated, somewhat ignorant, but altogether good-hearted. These traits were consistently stuck to throughout the book. Equally well-developed is Viola, who is shown to be much smarter and calmer than Todd. And we learn that she's also pretty tough. 
 One of the most interesting things about this book is the way it almost changes genre as more of the world is revealed. In the first few chapters, I was quite convinced that this was a dystopian novel. But as it's revealed that they are all settlers on a new planet, and that they came her and gave up most of their technology voluntarily, it becomes more and more a science-fiction novel. By the end of the book, this world doesn't have a lot of traits that are dystopian at all. If a society voluntarily becomes a dystopia, is it still a dystopia? Something to think about. 
 The story was fast-paced, and after the first few chapters it became difficult to put down. I also want to mention that, in light of my criticisms, this is a children's book, and it's a good one. I will definitely be reading The Ask And The Answer at some point."
4,Extremely dark but captivating. Caleb is one of those characters that you really should despise but you just cannot.
5,"Review: 
 Protagonist: Maguire believes she's a bad luck charm. Things seem to happen to her, leaving her practically unscathed while others get sick, seriously injured, or even die. This has led to Maguire having some serious anxiety issues, where she feels if she's around other people the Universe with somehow punish them. Most, if not all, of Maguire's character development stems from this fear. I really liked Maguire. The thing about Paula Stokes is that she never writes the most put together characters that just need a bit of tweaking here and there, she writes characters that are flawed, sometimes with deep scars, that to so many people are easy to identify with. This book is no different, Maguire's character development never felt rushed or unrealistic, it felt ver in line with who she is and where she needed to be by the end of this story. 
 Romance: When Maguire and Jordy first meet after one of her therapy sessions, I expected the romance to move rather quickly. A few bumps here and there but for the most part for there to be a lot of romance in this book. However the romance between these two is a much more slow burning one, which given their personalities and histories it makes sense why things don't happen too fast. The romance between the two is really sweet and while there isn't a lot of intense romantic tension there are a lot of really sweet romantic moments spread throughout this book. This is probably my favorite Paula Stokes romance yet! 
 World-Building: While this book is pretty much a fluffier and lighter contemporary novel, it does deal with serious topics such as anxiety, PTSD, OCD, and other mental disorders. The things Maguire went through before the story begins are stranger than fiction, but probably not unheard of. I really enjoyed the psychology aspect of this book, being a former psychology major myself, and while there are some liberties taken here and there, for the most part everything if fairly accurate. Actually next to the adorable romance I found the ""Session"" chapters to be the most entertaining, not that this book on a whole isn't entertaining. Then there's the sports aspect. I've learned a lot about sports reading as many YA books as I do, but I don't think I've ever learned so much about a sport all in one book. Stokes does a fantastic job of describing both the sport and it being played without making it seem boring or superfluous. While there isn't ALL that much tennis in this book the scenes where it's present are just as entertaining as the rest of the book. 
 Predictability: So for the most part I think I have my contemporary twist radar properly calibrated. Things seemed to flow really easily and while there were quite a few things that I hadn't guessed prior to the reveal, I think I'll just chock that up to my ""Fluffy Contemporary"" margin of error, also because Stokes is pretty amazing at laying down foreshadowing without leading you right to the answer. In fact the things that I easily called were the usually big picture plot points, actually I was pretty happy that I was able to call the ending to this book. 
 Ending: So, I'm not saying the ending's predictable, it all depends on how familiar you are with tropes and YA formulas, but even though I was able to predict it, I wouldn't have wanted a different ending to this story. What goes down in what I like to refer to as the ""final climax"" was totally necessary to the plot and really helped leave this standalone with as few loose ends as possible. The ending isn't totally idealistic and in all honesty, it would have been boring if it was. 
 Rating: 
 So, soon after I started this I wasn't sure if I'd give it five stars, I'd read an earlier version of some of the first chapters and there were some aspects I enjoyed more to the intro. However even with all that being said, this book is amazing. It's a fun and fast paced light contemporary novel perfect for Spring/Summer reading!"
5,"This is a fun little story. Did you have invisible friends when you were a child? I had a whole fleet of them -- different friends for different circumstances and occasionally they would all get together at the same time and we'd have a big party. Well, the main character in this story has a lot of invisible friends too. The thing is, he's an adult and he can really see them. The main character, Stephen, is incredibly smart, but his knowledge and skills have been divided up into different ""aspects"" of himself, which manifest as actual people with whom he has conversations. He's fully aware that these people don't really exist, but he mostly interacts with them as if they were real. 
 Since the story is so short, I don't really want to talk about the plot for fear of spoiling the fun of reading/listening to it for somebody else. I'll just say that it's interesting, and that it's sort of a cross between a mystery and science fiction. The story is resolved pretty well and stands alone well enough although there are some small threads left hanging. There's a lot of humor in the story and my only real complaint is that it wasn't longer - I would have loved a full-length novel with this character and setting. It was just too short to get into things in as much depth as I would have liked. 
 I actually listened to this as an audio book. I don't have a lot of audiobook experience, but I thought the narrator did a great job and was easy to follow. I could tell which character the narrator was speaking for even before the speaking character had been identified. The story kept my attention very well which is something I sometimes have trouble with when listening to audio books. I had actually listened to this story once before, a few years back, but I enjoyed it equally as much the second time. I'm listening to it again now because I intend to listen to the sequel soon and I wanted to refresh my memory."

 Video from http://www.mousecircus.com/videotour.... 
 This novel for young adults begins with the eerie and frightening murder of an entire family...except one, a toddler who escapes from a cold and motivated killer. The toddler crawls to the graveyard up the hill where he will begin a new life, living into his teens between the boundary of life and death. 
 Although this story begins spectacularly, the language of the ancient graveyard dwellers may lose some reluctant readers. It is for this section that Neil Gaimon's audio, which is available free on his website, is particularly useful. Gaimon reads at an appropriate pace that builds suspense and scaffolds comprehension through expression that only the author could pull off. This video recording has the added bonus of being filmed in front of an audience who reacts to the hilarious scenes which thread through the more creepy sections. 
 The Graveyard Book is something more than a coming-of-age story. It evokes questions about good and evil, reality and imagination, innocence and knowledge. The ending is satisfying, but ripe for a sequel."
3,"i hate you, Hana. 
 What's with the e-novella these days? I think Hana's character is strong enough to float in Delirium without her POV as seen (or read) here in this short story; thus, rendering this in-between ebook as unnecessary. 
 Well, I was already spoiled with the story. But still, I got mad when i read about Hana's... jealousy? irrational thinking? betrayal? 
 I'm not sure about you, but if Hana appears again in the last book, Requiem, i hope she doesn't have a happy ending. *vindictive* Ha!"
3,"I'm a huge Shakespeare fan. My favorite play of his being Macbeth, for its violence and cruelty. But Romeo and Juliet has also been a favorite of mine and I liked the idea of of it being told form Rosaline's perspective. In all honesty I've always loved Rosaline, even though she is only mentioned in the play for breaking Romeo's heart towards the beginning. I liked the fact that she didn't fall on her knees for him once he declared his love for her. After seeing the ridiculous things he does with Juliet I can only imagine what he tried to do to woo Rosaline. 
 When you were mine is told from Rosaline's perspective, with a twist. Rosaline doesn't turn down Romeo and break his heart, instead he leaves her. Rosaline and Rob have been best friends for years and one day everything changes with a kiss. After spending a summer apart they get together and go on one date but the next day during a school dance Rob is instantly attracted to Rosaline's cousin--Juliet and kisses her. Leaving Rosaline heartbroken. 
 The rest of the book is told as Rosaline deals with her heartbreak; Juliet is described as a selfish rich girl who is turning Rob into a man no one recognizes. He ignores Rosaline and decides not to apply to Stanford with her like they had planned since they were kids. Rosaline also deals with a budding romance between another character, someone not many people like but Rosaline finds herself attracted to. 
 I liked the idea of the story put in modern time and told in Rosaline's perspective but I'm not a hundred percent in love with how it all came together. For one I wasn't sure if I ever liked Len. Sure he was sweet and understood Rosaline but I didn't like the idea of Rosaline with him, it didn't seem right. Second, I felt a pang of annoyance at both Rob and Juliet and their deaths. Everyone knows they commit suicide in the end, but in the book we aren't made a hundred percent sure. And if it was a suicide it didn't seem as dramatic as Shakespeare's version. I didn't like how Rob completely retreated from Rosaline since they had such a long history of being friends since they were little. It didn't fit the story, it felt sort of...off. 
 When you were mine was a light, short, enjoyable read. Unfortunately it's wasn't my type of take on the famous play."
4,"I found this book very intriguing and fun. I liked the cast of characters, especially Sookie, who I found very spunky and unique. The writing was simplistic, without too much description, and I liked that. I should have started this series a long time ago!"
3,"Whatever I guess. It's only been a week since I read this and I forgot like 80% of everything that happened. It had a decent cliffhanger though. I guess onto the mammoth and then hopefully I can be done with this cast of characters. 
 Actually I do remember something I wanted to ask Cassandra Clare........... 
 .......... WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU SO OBSESSED WITH YOUR CHARACTERS AND INCEST. 
 I DON'T CARE HOW BAD THAT SOUNDS. I HAD TO SIT THROUGH THAT COMPLETELY CRINGINESS AND I FEEL IT IS MY DUTY TO SPREAD THE WORD."
2,"1.5 stars 
 this book was not a jam for me. if it weren't for my burning curiosity, i would not have finished it. there's not much i can say that hasn't already been said about this book. if you're looking for someone with whom you can fangirl over christian grey, that's not me. if you're looking for someone who's going to analyze all the implications of abuse in this book, that's also not me (a simple google search should take care of that). 
 things i didn't like about this book: 
 1) the way e. l. james didn't even try to change her characters from twilight characters? obvi this book was twilight fanfic but come on, if you're getting your book published, can't you at least put in 0.2 ounces of effort in injecting some degree of creativity? where is the craftsmanship? 
 2) the relationship between christian and anatasia. red flags everywhereee. not cool. their relationship is the furthest thing from cool. there is no chill. it bordered on emotionally abusive to me. 
 3) the writing. the writing is kind of terrible. i know people say stephenie meyer is a terrible writer (something I personally don't agree with) but e. l. james takes the cake. also, it's very clear through her diction and several other details that e. l. james isn't american. jussayin. 
 4) where is the plot? 
 things i cannot speak about: 
 1) the portrayal of BDSM. i cannot say anything on this because i do not know enough about it. i cannot tell you if this book accurately portrays a BDSM relationship. i can tell you, however, that anastasia is repeatedly stalked, intimidated, and isolated. i don't like that. also, there are scenes where ana is clearly uncomfortable with things that are happening, but christian ends up convincing her in one way or another. 
 things i liked: 
 1) the banter/email exchanges. those were cute and really funny and primarily the reason why this book earned 1.5 stars. by far the highlight of the book. the whole book should've been written in email exchanges tbh bc those are the only times the characters are more than tolerable. 
 2) ...the book was compelling?? ish? i mean, i finished it so that must count for something, right? 
 things that weren't as bad as i thought they were going to be: 
 1) inner goddess. people have complained about ana's inner goddess countless times. i didn't really mind her. 
 2) tampon scene LOL. it was still gross personally but the lack of description of blood was well received on my end. 
 i can see why people hate this book; i can see why people love this book. i respect readers of both opinions. btw if people want to read this book to indulge in their fantasies or whatever (which is why the fanfiction was written in the first place), let them do it. this shouldn't need to be said, but fantasies are not reality. reading about something is not the same as wanting it to happen in real life. you can enjoy whatever fantasy while recognizing its dangers and realistic repercussions. don't shame the people who love this trilogy. 
 ok peace out 
 fyi: I don't condone rape or abuse of any kind and to suggest anyone does simply by reading/watching fifty shades is insulting to an unfathomable degree."
3,"This book wasn't what I thought it would be. It's not really about actual gods, but a hero-filled metropolis. Which is fine. I can't say I loved it, but it was a decent read."
3,"This is dreadful, and I really mean awful. Good awful, like the kind of film you watch where everything is terrible, but that is the beauty of the thing. It's really rather ridiculous, and completely unrealistic, however, I do like the dedication to making a Vegas mistake work. I like their enthusiasm towards one another. I also like the representation of Paris, because we all love a bit of Parisian life! 
 This book takes the whole 'What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas' and 'everybody gets hitched in Vegas' to the extreme."
3,"Interesting, well-written, lots of psychological levels here....Set in 1925-30 Europe (Copenhagen, Paris, Dresden) it is the story of Greta and Einar Wegener, 2 artists each with an interesting past the other doesn't know much about. When Greta's portrait subject, an opera singer, can't make her pose appointment, Greta recruits her husband Einar to put on her dress and shoes and pose instead. A whole tidal wave of change is set in motion with that simple act. Einar begins to dress as a woman more frequently and even assumes a name for him/herself in that role: Lily. Eventually he wants to actually become Lily and German Dr. Boulk takes on the sex change surgery which is revolutionary at the time. This is a long, slow process and to see Greta and Einar's relationship evolve along with Einar's transformation is very touching. She is 100% supportive even though it means losing her husband. Things become complicated too (what a tangled web we weave) when Greta starts to paint Lily and begins to have international success as an artist. Einar's career had been the successful one prior to this. And his creative energy is now channeled inward as he becomes a new person. Another layer of complication is the introduction of Hans, Einar's boyhood friend (and crush) who is an art dealer, represents Greta's work, but also has designs on her. Though this is all very soap-opera-ish it doesn't come across that way due to the deft and understated story telling. What was surprising (and hard to swallow) was the acceptance in that time period of Einar's transformation. Yes, they are bohemian artists, and yes, this is Europe, but Nazism is on the rise in Germany and there are still so many sexual taboos in that era. Greta's twin brother, Carlisle is wholly supportive as is Hans and Anna, the opera singer, not to mention all Dr. Boulk's affiliations. When Lily wants to undergo a final surgery to have a uterus implanted and possibly bear children, some of that support wavers, especially Greta's. She is not objecting to the surgery itself, but Lily's weakness and ability to survive it. The ending is rather ambiguous if symbolic and left me wanting more. Part Pygmalion, part Icarus, it is still a fascinating, well done look at the need to be true to self and the grace of others to accept it."
3,"The Girl in 6E is Deanna Madden. She's in her early twenties, works long hours and does all her shopping online. She sounds like any other normal woman but she's far from normal. Deanna hasn't left her apartment in three years and has minimal contact with the outside world. The most companionship she has in through the lens of a camera connected to an array of websites. When Deanna goes online she's Jessica, a girl in college making money by hanging out in free chat-rooms and for hire in private sessions. She makes more money than she knows what to do with and has no responsibilities other than her online job but nothing is worth what happens in her mind and what she would do if she left the apartment. 
 I found this book so many times in the library and every time I thought that it looked so interesting and I wanted to read it but I still put it down. When my friend asked for recommendations for more crazy thrillers I thought of this book and it also gave me the push I needed to finally pick it up! I started this book last night and finished it in a couple of hours with a few breaks in between. Since it was a fairly short book I didn't find too many lulls in it and I didn't have much trouble powering through it. When I reached the end of the book I was definitely grasped with the feeling of wonder and confusion over how messed up this book was. There's no way this book could compete with the perfection of You (because I'm getting buried with that book) but it's better than Girl on the Train by a long-shot and rougher than Gone Girl, it actually makes Gone Girl look positively sweet. It does have a similar feel to Dark Places or The Grown-Up but it's still a totally unique plot of it's own. There's violence, madness and pure evil but nothing for me to connect to. Even if I didn't connect to Deanna I'm still interested in what she'll do next so I'm already planning on reading the next book in the series. They are standalone books but it's advised that you read them in order and the next book is Do Not Disturb!

 Spoilers and Thoughts below... 
 (view spoiler)[The first chapter is very compelling and it just throws you right into the story and the gritty truth. Then we learn that her mother murdered her whole family and then killed herself and that's enough to mess anyone up but Deanna has it even worse because she has those hungering urges to kill as well. I was just baffled that Deanna was a crazed murderer because I didn't want to read the whole plot and ruin the mystery so I thought she was an online sex-worker that discovered that disgusting man and went to help a young girl but this made it a lot more interesting. 
 Then we switched to the perspective of Michael and I was completely disgusted. Reading his horrid thoughts was like having spiders crawl over my skin. I hated him with a passion from the moment his motives were clear and I was so ready for Deanna to take him down. 
 I find the fact that Deanna is a virgin a little bit tiring like I've heard that story too many times where a girl is totally hot and experienced in all things in seduction but hasn't done the deed herself. A person like that exists of course but I just felt like it made her character a little less sparkly to me, like she was becoming less interesting with an eye roll. Also, the girl (most of the time having a job with a sexual nature) with the hacker friend that she can call for all her off requests is another thing I've read several stories like that but that's fine, it works for the story. 
 When ""Ralph"" finally found Deanna it was so gross to read his dirty fantasy but it was interesting to read about all the things people fantasize about and the definitions for many things at the start of the chapters and throughout. Reading his chapters where he reminisces about his kills also reminded me of The Lovely Bones. 
 Another surprising point in the book was her romance with Jeremy, the mail guy, after she attempts to kill him and realizing a life of murder isn't as easy as she imagined. 
 To me, it seemed obvious that Deanna had some part in the murder of her family and I was glad to see I was right about that. I wonder if she would have been full of murderous urges if she hadn't come back home that night and found her mother but then her mother might not have died and she could've possibly hurt her or influenced her from prison or a mental institution. Since it's also a mental condition she probably would've come across it on her own in time. 
 It was lovely to see the happy ending with Annie back with her parents and the disgusting man not being able to hurt anyone again but it felt rushed from the point where she found Annie to the end when everything else in the book was drawn out in detail. It just seemed like the stand-off between her and him should've lasted longer. Then in the end, as much as she wished it was gone, the hunger was still there but she's trying not to let it take over her life and she's going out with Jeremy! I wonder if he'll be in the next novel. Maybe she'll kill him. (hide spoiler)]"
0,"Like with Saga Vol. 3, I don't know how to rate this. Is it a 4.5 stars? 5 stars? Lower? I really liked this volume, but something was missing...what was missing? I don't know! For now, it's a five stars but maybe in the future I'll edit this review..."
4,"Found this to be much like the first book - I found it took me until about halfway before I really got into it. The first part of the book I actually found very irritating - Salander I find a very unrealistic character and I don't really like her. (What *can't* she do?!) But towards the middle I found it really exciting and enjoyable, as everything came together and began to unravel and we found out more about Salander and her past. Very clever. 
 Still - lots of TMI in the beginning that I did *not* need or want to know about the characters, about their sexual preferences, and Salander's breasts and sexual habits also appear to be quite a big topic (she gets a boob job) early in the book. Was there any need for this? It doesn't add anything to the story or the characters..."
5,"WOW!!! SO.MUCH.HAPPENING in this book. Each one in Nick's series just gets better & better. 
 These are not coming out fast enough! I can't wait to see where the next book goes after the cliffhanger in this one."
5,"The psychological ghost story ... No blood, no guts, no rattling chains or subterranean torture chambers. Just careful, controlled, cumulative shivers that, at their best, force you to question what the nature of reality is, and where exactly the border between the thing perceived and the subject perceiving it lies. Do we trust our senses in trying to evaluate the nature of the world? If not, what other measures do we have recourse to; and, if so, do we have to take everything perceived, however seemingly absurd, as an indication of reality? Henry James explored this unnerving territory; so too did Shirley Jackson. Now Sarah Waters has launched another expedition, in a novel that both pays tribute to her esteemed predecessors and breaks new ground. 
 Post WWII, austerity Britain: a Labour government is in power; the National Health Service is on its way in, and the old social structure is on its way out. Rural physician Dr Faraday is in many ways representative of the changing times - of humble origins, he's a self-made man whose rise coincides with his social betters' fall. Yet he too seems in many ways uneasy about this quiet evolution, or revolution: in particular, he's worried about the impact of the NHS on his livelihood, while in more general terms he seems to yearn for the more settled and orderly world he remembers from his childhood. He's lived all his life in the shadow of the local manor house, Hundreds Hall, and the Ayres family, its owners. He remembers it, and them, as grand, impressive, enchanting; yet when he's called in to treat a supposedly sick maid, he finds dearth, decay and a kind of controlled desperation. The much-depleted Ayres family - tortured war veteran Rod, plain, hearty spinster Caroline, and their frail, embittered mother, Mrs Ayres - have property, but no money, no prospects and, seemingly, no place in a society that is leaving them behind. In time Dr Faraday becomes their confidante and friend and, briefly, Caroline's suitor; and in time, too, some very odd things start happening at the hall. Is there a ghost? Or are the family just haunted by their glorious past and uncertain future, by their own losses and pains and fear? Who is the ""little stranger"" of the title? You're left to ponder these questions for yourself, and it says something for Waters that, in an age impatient with subtlety, she trusts her readers enough to leave them unanswered. 
 This is a beautiful book: suggestive, poetic, dark and, yes, haunting. The one thing it isn't, in truth, is frightening, which may disappoint anyone looking for a good scare. Dr Faraday, the narrator, experiences very little personally, so most of the ghostly happenings are recounted second-hand by a sceptical rationalist who's quick to provide answers and accounts. In fact, it sometimes seems that Waters is as keen as anyone to explain everything away, and she's actually rather too successful at it: the chill factor quickly diminishes under Dr Faraday's cool scientific gaze. 
 Still, it would be churlish to complain too vociferously about it: this was never meant to be blood-curdling horror. It's a meditation on flux and decay, and the consequences of being on the losing side when the tide of history changes. If you like your supernatural served with brains, you'll love this."

 Lost In Wonderland 
 Ilona Andrews totally blew me away again. Kate Daniels is such an amazingly strong female lead, who takes shit from no one. Despite being a lone wolf, Kate constantly manages to find herself in the centre of trouble surrounded by faithful friends and foes alike joined for the same cause, this time to save the world from an apocalypse. 
 I think what I loved most about this book besids the overall plot was the development of Kate and Currans relationship. It's one of those love-hate deals, where they're both fighting for the upper hand, but also manage to support and be there for each other in times of desperation...and the teasing...don't even get me started. Curran knows how to make a girl weak in the knees. 
 'A slow, lazy carnivorous smile touched Curran's lips. ""Not only will you sleep with me, but you will say 'please'"". 
 I stared at him shocked. 
 The smile widened. ""You will say 'please' before and 'thank-you' after"". 
 - Ilona Andrews (Magic Burns) 
 Even though it is marketed as adult, there isn't any explicit sex scenes so far yet (although I'm keeping my fingers crossed haha). But if you like a good romantic build-up with lots of strained conversation, teasing and sarcasm and a love-hate relationship then this is the book for you. There's chemistry, fighting, sarcasm, an archer who can disappear into mist, magic, tech, shape-shifters. You name it, it's likely to be found in this series. Overall a great adult urban fantasy that I highly suggest. It is addicting and will keep you entertained throughout."
4,"Now this is 166 pages I'm not used to.... 
 I have to say I don't really like such short books, because I usually feel like the stories aren't as complete, and things get skipped over, and left unanswered. But Lauren Gallagher used every single word to her advantage, and I walked away from this book thoroughly satisfied. First of all this book is erotica at its best. OMG! Those scenes were so incredibly hot, they had be blushing, my mouth dry, and I was at work. I couldn't believe how soon the amazing steam started and it never disappointed. I think that these two had chemistry that didn't ever need to be mentioned, because it just ran off the pages. 
 Jocelyn is a frustrated single mother of two, when she finally breaks down and hires an escort because she's tired of the nonsensical dating that she's been doing for the past couple of years. It's clear that she just wants some mind blowing sex, and boy does she get it with Sabian. I think that it was the way he made her feel so comfortable that first time, that really got her hooked, at least for the sex part. There was even a scene with lots of naughty forbidden work sex. I loved that she really was able to respect his profession once they decided to take their relationship to the next level. She wasn't unaffected by what he did, but she understood that this was his profession, and that he had no problem in doing it. The trust that she demonstrated throughout the book, was very very reminiscent of a woman who is in her 30s, and not some lost teenage girl, which was refreshing to say the least. 
 Sabian who we later come to know as Austin is just the hottest escort ever, and I definitely understand why Jocelyn decided to stick around despite the issues with him being an escort. It is clear that Austin is fine with what he does, though he doesn't share his profession with everyone, he is able to hold his own against everyone. When he finally begins to fall for Jocelyn it is mostly because she is willing to accept him for what he does, and she wants to know him beyond his job. I thought he would struggle with his job more once he started to really fall for her, but then again the book was from Jocelyn's POV, and so we didn't really always know how he was feeling. I loved how the author brought up how a sex worker must feel, especially because they are so often ostracized in our society, and there were certain aspects his job that clearly bothered Austin, but he dealt with it as well as he could've. I loved the way he worshiped Jocelyn, and how he found little ways (like asking her to look in the eyes while they made love) to differentiate for her sex and intimacy. 
 My one serious hang up with this book, is a personal one, and it was the fact that Jocelyn saw herself as damaged soly because she was a single mom. Now I am not, but I don't think that's the case, I think single moms don't have that much of a problem, but I could be wrong. 
 Overall, it you can deal with the fact that Austin is an escort and proud of it, and enjoy his work, I think this is a very well written novella, and I look forward to reading more from this author. This was erotica with real emotion and plot and storyline, and it was a lovely unexpected read."
0,"DNF @ 40 pages 
 I was pretty excited for this book considering Shaun David Hutchinson is a fairly well-loved author who writes LGBT novels, 
 But... nah. I've been over quirky ""i'm a special snowflake"" YA books for like five years, and I already hated every character and didn't enjoy the writing style so I'm not gonna bother."
5,"OhMyGosh, there are no words that I can even think at this time cause I'm so overwhelmed that all three books are outstanding. 
 I don't think I can sleep for a couple more days cause Gideon and Eva are your non-stop soap opera but in a book. 
 Superb writer, awesome story, need I say more. 
 LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE it :)"
5,"Homecoming tells the story about Rose Hathaway and Dimitri Belikov trip to Russia to visit Dimitri's family. After hearing words about Dimitri turning back into a dhampir after got bitten by a strigoi, his family wants to see Dimitri for themselves. They all want to see Dimitri healthy and alive. Rose and Dimitri reunited with his family and an Alchemist, Henry came to tell them that humans have been killed by an ancient strigoi called Blood King. So Rose, Dimitri and Mark went out to slay the ancient strigoi. 
 ""He was my badass battle god."" 
 I loved this novella so much because of Rose/Dimitri, I really everything about them. 
 Well done Richelle, another beautiful ending. But I must say this was too short."
4,"A classic-style mystery/horror story. Nate moves into a new apartment in a strange building. As he and his fellow tenants investigate, things get continually weirder and scarier. A really enjoyable listen."
4,"The last sci-fi book I've read was Ready Player One and by that standard this book was only a bit short of becoming a favorite. I've had this for months but ignored it because of a false start. I regret that now because this is one of the best debut novels I've read. I've been lax in buying and reading science fiction books for a while now but this convinced me to spend more time in that section of my local book store... once my copy of Armada gets here and I've finished reading it of course. I'm a fan, Andy Weir, and I eagerly anticipate your next book."
1,"Very rarely do I read a book that never draws me in, not even a little bit. I put this book down with ten pages left earlier this morning, and wasn't upset at all. Darrow was a protagonist I never related to or rooted for. I understand that he's not supposed to be like-able. That's fine. I loved The Great Gatsby and none of those characters are like-able. The whole time, I felt like I was reading The Hunger Games repackaged for adults. If I hadn't paid for this (which is disappointing since I almost never buy books, being a broke college student) I would not have finished it."
3,"I really waffled between 3-4 stars, so let's call it 3.5. I liked it. It was quick, easy, and engrossing, but it wasn't particularly deep. Harriet is held at an arm's length, making it difficult to invest in her as a reader. And the whole time-hopping chronology seems to be really in fashion these days, but it worked particularly well for this novel. It's probably not something that will stick with me but it's great for a summer/beach read."
5,"This story's twists and turns kept me reading. It reads a lot like a fairy tale told in first person, with layers upon layers of intrigue deepening throughout as the protagonist tries to figure out how to deal with her changing circumstances. I especially loved how the main character is a very believable bumbling kind of girl whose eccentric tendency of tearing/staining her clothes becomes explained by the fact that she finds she is a witch with a very different way of casting spells. I also liked how the tension moves from her dismay at being picked by the local wizard to serve him to discovering that the nearby Wood, a malevolent forest near her village that often captures villagers, has targeted her best friend. In trying to save her friend, she is drawn deep into the wizard's struggle to keep the Wood from overrunning her entire valley. 
 There is a sex scene that feels a little too grown up for YA, but overall this is an enchanting story."
4,"OK, OK, I get it now....it took a while for them to grow on me, but I finally see why critics love these books so much. I'm still not over my complete disgust with Lila as a person and friend, but the events in this book certainly cause her to be viewed more sympathetically. And while I was afraid this last book in the series would wrap everything up a little too neatly, I should have known better. Now I can't wait for the mystery of ""who, exactly, is Elena Ferrante?"" To be revealed."
3,A unique perspective on WW2. I feel like I should have liked this book more. I think maybe it was the audio format that didn't work for me. I kept getting lost and confused and didn't find I was paying full attention.
4,"I reread this book and i still love it as much as i did. Madeline is so cute and Olly too ! They are just so cute together. Olly is so sweet with Maddy, i love him so much. The story is just so great"
2,"I don't typically read adult fiction, mainly because I am not an adult, but this book sounded interesting, and I was in the mood for a mystery, so I decided to give it a chance. I will say that this book is very well written, but it did not hold my attention at all. I found it boring and excessively long, and I didn't care about any of the characters. I don't think that this is a bad book, but it definitely wasn't for me. 
 *thank you Penguin for the free eARC*"
5,"I'm going 100% with my heart to rate this one. 
 The eve of Mother's Day is always hard for me. It's one of those days where my heart is so broken that everything becomes a blur. I just miss my mom so much... yet there's nothing like a book to help me go through this day. 
 There may have been lots of drama and cliches but Finding Dandelion was everything I needed that night. I needed the tears, the connection with the protagonist and her thoughts. I needed to not feel alone. And I didn't. So sue me for liking this book if you want but it won't change a single thing. I really loved Danielle so much. It kind of sounds weird but it was as if she was being strong for both of us that difficult night. So thank you Lex Martin for create Dani! 
 PS. I know how heart-breaking to have someone close to you with cancer or losing someone so if you are reading this and you ever need someone to talk, just send me a message. 
 PPS. Happy belated Mother's Day to all of your lovely moms and to to every mom here!!! Hugs to everyone!"
4,"What a unique concept! The world has evolved to a time when everyone can read each others' minds...well, almost everyone. Those who can't are called Zeros and aren't trusted. They're second class citizens. Unfortunately for Kira, she's now passed the age when everyone develops their mind-reading skills and is having to come to terms with the horrible fact that she will have to live her life as a zero. Until things get even worse! 
 One day she unexpectedly connects with her friend Raf's mind and almost kills him. Turns out that she's a ""mindjacker"". She can't read minds in the traditional way but she can link into other people's minds and command them. 
 The futuristic world created by the author is both intriguing and scary...after all, I wouldn't want anyone knowing what I was thinking 24/7!! In a world where secrets are hard to keep, anything can happen. I enjoyed reading the descriptions of what it is like to go to school, the interesting gadgets that can be commanded by your mind and about the sensitivity around relationships all due to the fact that everyone knows each others thoughts. 
 The characters in this book are great. Kira is strong and very likeable. She is thrown into many strange and scary situations and she shows herself not only as a brave person but as a caring one as well. Raf is Kira's best friend and the only one willing to continue to have her back even though he thinks she's a Zero. He's a solid presence in her crazy world. Simon is a jacker. He teaches Kira about the mindjacking world but he also leads her into danger. He's a darker character, one I wasn't sure I should trust. But he was so well written, that I couldn't help but enjoy reading about him. And maybe even liking him a little bit...OK..a lot! There are many bad guys in this story...all very three dimensional, all planning evil and all easy to dislike! 
 The plot is filled not only with colorful characters but also with twist and turns. Once Kira is immersed in the jacker world, she has to use her intellect and her new-found jacker abilities to set things right. Trusting people and being trusted is a luxury in this world and Kira must have her whits about her at all times if she's to navigate through its dangerous paths. 
 I must admit that the book dragged a bit for me early on and that I found the futuristic terminology (words like ""mesh"" and ""demens"") were used a little too often in the beginning for my liking (although this was probably done to get the reader used to them). But that was easily overlooked because once this story gets going, there's no stopping it. The pace is fast and the story is action-packed. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what happens next!"
5,This book is ethereal.
4,"Reading this felt like I was in history class while actually enjoying it and not looking like this... 
 This novel further proved the reason why I actually love historical fiction when done right. It explored on the 'whats' and 'what ifs' that are not exactly elaborated or recorded in history; What did Selene feel when she and her siblings lost their parents and were raised by their parents' murderers? What if the reason why Alexanders' life and fate not recorded in its entirety is because (view spoiler)[ he was actually gay and was assassinated by Caesar's men? (hide spoiler)] What if Selene felt attracted to someone during her childhood? What did Juba II feel for Selene and what did she feel for him in return? Was the marriage actually a love match? 
 I honestly didn't know crap about this part of history but I felt compelled to actually look up actual facts after I read this. I started actually caring for the characters who are real historical personalities that existed thousands of years ago. 
 The reason why this isn't a 5 star read for me? Now I know that this is going to sound childish of me but... 
 IT NEEDED MORE JUBA X SELENE MOMENTS. Like for reals. 
 I kept on rooting for Juba ever since the first time they saw each other. I kept on saying, ""Come on Selene! Stop looking at Marcellus and start noticing that man who obviously cares about you!"" I didn't actually even mind the age gap.*sigh*"
4,"Okay. 
 I enjoyed this book, I really did, but it took me at least 100 pages to actually get invested in the story, it lacked something special with the characters that bugged me a little. They seemed to me to lack the right amount of emotion in the first few chapters (too much impulsive restlessness from Safi), or history(from Iseult - some of which was revealed throughout the course of the book) though I am still confused about some underlying, but important parts of the book (Why was there a war? What was the event that initiated the Truce? Why does everyone hate the Nomatsi's? Are they actually a gypsy race or were they displaced by the War? I need answers!) 
 But once I got into the story (around the time of the Nubrevnan Four Step!) I enjoyed it. I just had to keep reading to find out if what I was thinking would happen actually did come true, I wanted to find out who was allied with who, what the history was behind the characters, and so many other things. 
 The plot was fast moving, but not enough to feel rushed. The web of half truths and bigger plans left me wondering what would happen next."
4,"Wonderful story telling. Characters pulled me in. Neat ideas. 
 I was reluctant to read this because I was not interested in a Kennedy conspiracy-analysis book. I was surprised and pleased that half of the story was about other things - time travel, interesting characters, and things they do. Jake makes more than one time-travel-trip because he sees consequences of his actions and wants to redo things. Another neat idea was the Past does not want to be changed, and each time makes it difficult for Jake in different ways. And more neat ideas. Aside from the tear jerker part, the overall plot has a happy ending which I liked. 
 THINGS I DID NOT LIKE: 
 HISTORICAL ACCURACY AND DEPRESSING: 
 King said he read a stack of books almost as tall as he was - for research. About 2/3 the way through there are 200 or more pages about Oswald in Texas and fictional Jake in Fort Worth and Dallas. I assume King is being factually accurate, but I don't want facts from King; I want his imagination. That part of the book is dull. (If King were creating the character Oswald, he could put interesting and weird things in Oswald's head. But we are not in Oswald's head because King is being factual. Instead we get a textbook.) 
 Toward the end of the Oswald section, I was depressed and frustrated. I'm not sure why - something about the helplessness of so many bad things happening to Jake including amnesia. I've been ok with other books having bad things happen to the main character, but for some reason this was a downer. (On the day when I was reading this part, I felt too bad to talk to one of my friends.) 
 FIRST PERSON. 
 I don't like first person narrative books. In third person I lose myself in the story. In first person I feel like I'm listening to someone talk. They experienced it not me. So when I started this book and realized it was first person, my reaction was ""ohhhh noooo."" But I do have to say the author did it well. 
 TEAR JERKER ENDING. 
 I don't want to read books that make me cry, and this one did. The reason for crying is in the Spoiler. 
 (view spoiler)[ 
 The tear jerker is mourning for two people in love who cannot be together. 
 (hide spoiler)] 
 AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR: 
 Craig Wasson's voice was ok. He did women well which is hard for male narrators to do. But I did not like the way he frequently laughed. It was like a nervous laugh or a chuckle that was NOT written in the text. It took me out of the story. I'm thinking ""why is he laughing?"" Here are three examples. I use caps for the words where he laughed. 
 ""As I've said living in the past IS CONFUSING."" 
 ""I spotted something on the floor of the backseat that made me flush with a sense of guilt that WAS FAR OUT of proportion to what the object was."" (It was a library book which he forgot to return.) 
 ""I had a fine car, a car I'd sort of fallen in love with to TELL YOU THE TRUTH. And there was no shortage of good fast roads in Texas.""

1,"oh man. this was so bad. it's about a minor character who exists solely to get killed in Eclipse to show how ruthless the vampire government is. you already know what's gonna happen, which is a difficult starting point to begin with, and Meyer just doesn't have the skill to make it swing on the page. 
 anyway. ~*~*~SPOILER~*~*~ the Volturi kill Bree -- not because she eats people, but because she's a loose end. it's sad, I guess. the Cullens sort of flail ineffectually but don't make a serious attempt to stop it. 
 ok, this is the main thing that gets me about Twilight, and I think it's because nobody ever talks about it: what is the deal with the Cullens being all self-satisfied in their ""vegetarianism"" but never ever doing a goddamn thing about the fucked-up shit other vampires do? They tut-tut but they never devote any of their considerable talents to anything other than getting rich and staying out of trouble. I mean, at the end of New Moon, Edward and Bella witness a mass murder and don't appear to be outraged or anything. just a bit grossed out and scared. At the end of the Twilight sequence, it becomes clear that the Cullen clan have a significant power base. if they're so moral, why don't they try to leverage some of that power into, say, building an alliance with the werewolves to force vampires to stop eating people? or researching synthetic blood? you see where I'm going? but there's no hint of any of that. 
 and I think that cuts to the heart of what makes Twilight so fucking icky. its morality is restricted to the protection of the individual's soul. it's not about ending suffering and oppression -- it's about making sure you don't directly perpetuate it. in short, it's about keeping pure, not doing good, and it exemplifies the worst of conservative Christian morality."

 Fasten your seatbelt and hold on tight, as Reflected in You takes you on a powerful, sensual roller coaster ride. At times you'll want to cringe at what's coming next, other times you'll squeal with delight. No matter what, you are guaranteed an exhilarating trip - one that you'll want to repeat as soon as you are finished. 
 At times I wanted to rail at Gideon for his high-handed behavior, then of course five pages later I wanted to cuddle him and assure him of his worth. And Eva's no innocent here either, her jealousy takes on a life of its own and eventually her behavior sparks one of the hottest, most intense confrontations I've ever read. Through it all I felt for them, cheered for them, and gave myself over to Ms. Day's skilled narrative. This is the rare sequel that holds its own with the original. 
 It's not all dark and heavy the entire book, they have dinners with friends, a romantic getaway, times to act like a 'real' couple. There are much needed moments of levity and normalcy for the couple. 
 Gideon's mixed signals about his emotional commitment to their relationship present the most difficult challenge to Eva as she contemplates moving on. She was no shrinking violet before and continues to stand up for herself (while also knowing moments of great weakness). I loved that she told Gideon off and let him know his behavior was unacceptable - no curling up in a ball for our Ms. Trammel. (""I don't know what the fuck you're doing, ace, but this Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde shit ain't cutting it with me."") Eventually Eva assures Gideon that he has her trust, but without it being mutual, they have nothing. And so he does let her in, sharing his some details of his trauma, and all of his heart, in a touching, gut-wrenching scene. 
 Eva and Gideon are an exhausting couple whose journey keeps you on the edge of your seat, in less masterful hands than Ms. Day's, the result would not be nearly so satisfying."
4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 Honestly, I think this deserves a 4.5 out of 5. The motivations and personalities of the characters get a lot more fleshed out in this book. I love the banter between the Shadowhunters and especially Will's love of demon pox. 
 But oh, the love triangle. As love triangles go, it's actually not that bad. A lot of times with love triangles, there is one person who is clearly the better of the two options, but with Jem and Will, it's an extremely difficult call. And to Tessa's credit, she tries to make her decision easier for both Jem and Will by keeping her love for Will a secret. And you definitely feel for all three people. At this point in the story, as love triangles go, it is well done. And really, it's just my own personal hatred of them. Perhaps because the amount of time that has passed at this point I think has only been a few weeks or months at most and the devotion everyone has for each other seems unrealistically strong. 
 Plus the ""everyone who loves you will die"" curse seems a little melodramatic...although I suppose it explains Will's motivations and is the cause of the love triangle...anyway, that's why I can't give it a full 5 stars."

4,"And today boys and girls we have another three-for-one! 
 The trend twards ""dystopian"" fiction in YA literature in interesting in that most examples ive seen of it seem to be YA only by grace of having younger protagonists. Dipping here and there into YA im discovering that this is where all the ""fun"" writing has gone, leaving the contemporary literature scene to more highbrow writers. Which means of course, im picking up more and more YA materials. 
 ""The Maze Runner"" and it's two followups, ""The Scorch Trials"" and ""The Death Cure"" are a prime example of this trend. Good solid writing that's fully the equal of anything on the market. The style reminds me of the old 40's and 50's pulp fiction style writing, which makes a nice break from the ornate language most contemporary novelists seem to revel in. The plot has some interesting twists, and Dashner avoids telegraphing too much, while asking the question that has always stumped leaders of men- when do the ends justify the means? 
 Overall, if you liked ""The Hunger Games"" series, or if you have a young adult who was put off by the female lead* in that series, try these."
5,"Oh MY GOD! 
 Prophet and Tom are one of my new favorite m/m characters. 
 Two men with dark pasts, deep emotional scars inside and out, nightmares, battling their own demons and with their own craving for human contact, love and caring. 
 These two alpha males are so freaking hot. There's just something about deeply fucked up characters with anger issues and Dom/sub interchanging roles that make me go crossed eyed. They are hot, sexy, tattooed, pierced, troubled, angry and so so so damn dangerous. Loved this book. It was action filled, emotional, sexy, with a great plot. 
 WARNING: if you plan on reading this book I suggest you wait till the sequel comes out so you can read both books one after the other cause for me, the 28th can't get here soon enough!!"
5,"I cannot recommend this book enough. It is so rare to find a novel so connected to the migrant experience, and this hit all the right notes for me - that feeling when you don't want to be considered a failure or can't communicate what you're going through so you cut off contact, the weird romanticisation of your ""home"" while simultaneously talking it down with your new compatriots, moving between differently politicised landscapes and having aspects of your identity blown up or swept under the rug depending on where you were and who you were with... I could just relate to it all so much. I also loved how it explored two completely opposing experiences of migration from Nigeria to ""the west"", and how it also observed the differing experiences of other migrants through the eyes of our main characters, with them judging ""other kinds of Nigerians"" and the black Caribbean migrants. I just loved the depth of her characters and the honesty with which she discussed the politicised/tricky issue of race. 
 I still think about this book and the perspectives presented in it as a result, and it further gave me an entirely new perspective on my own experiences with migration/return. I feel like anyone would benefit from reading this book!"
4,"4.5 stars! 
 Review may contain spoilers! 
 Filthy Beautiful Lies reminds me of three other wonderful books. Emma Hart's Late Call, Pepper Winter's Tears of Tess, and Christina Lauren's Sweet Filthy Boy. As much as I'd like to spill why, I won't. My lips are sealed! 
 So Filthy Beautiful Lies made me curious and intrigued because of two reasons. One, because of the bold cover. Not that I'm gay, but that thigh gap is perfect. And two, because of the word filthy. Filthy is like the perfect word for a great smut. And dear god, it is. This one is really goooooood. Its like tasting the drops of a melted dark chocolate. The sexual tension between the two made me.. OKAY I ADMIT IT. It made me horny. LOL. 
 The hero's personality was surprising. He was soft and I swear to all the angels in the heavens, I would love to witness THE PACKAGE in his pants. Which was described to be large and is already reaching his belly button. And damn, 
 Colton Drake 
 . Yep, his name is Colton Drake, ladies. His name is enough to make your knickers drop. The name is fucking perfect for a gorgeous billionaire. Don't worry ladies, he doesn't have a red room of pain, or a traumatic past. This billionaire is definitely normal and lighter. He doesn't need a whip. LOL. 
 The heroine, Sophie, which is in need of money, decided to put herself in auction. And if she's bought, she's gonna be a sex slave for like.. 6 months. YES PLEASE. CAN I JOIN THAT AUCTION TOO? LOL. So she was unexpectedly bought by the yummy Colton Drake who seems to have a fondness with blowjobs. *cough* 
 Damn. 
 Let's go on with the story. That damn story that left me breathing for more. I'm guessing that Emma Hart was the one who decided to help with the last chapter and to leave it with a cliffy and a.. well.. a shocking revelation. I've read Late Call, and I also had the same reaction. *sigh* I don't really like cliffys like these but.. hell.. I have no choice but to wait. LOL. The cliffy left me breathing so hard and I was like.. CMON, THE PARTY IS JUST GETTING STARTED!! 
 Properly saying, it was really a great start for a series. Perfect unpredictable hero, shy innocent heroine, and a jaw dropping cliffy! Ugh.. I need the sequel, like.. right now. I can't wait to see what happens next. I'd like to go inside the damn story and comfort Sophie. God, her name's like an angel. 
 Btw, I just love how Colton calls her sweetness. Its just sweet, smooth, and refreshing. *dreamy sigh*

2,"Meh. Just meh. I didn't like the main character - like, at all - and I absolutely hated her boyfriend decision. There was too much casual making out, though - no real commitment or anything. The end kind of made up for the rest of the book, though. She gained more confidence in the end, which was good. But I just didn't really like it. The entire book was just a drag, and I only finished it because I hate putting books down without finishing them. : /"
3,"So this was a little disappointing to read because it was really just about Ella freaking out, even though I adored the flashbacks to when they were kids, but otherwise there was not much to the story and did anyone else notice that there were a lot of run-on sentences throughout the entire thing because I kind of noticed and it just really bothered me. 
 ^ Did you cringe while reading that sentence? You'll cringe a lot while reading the book then lol 
 I still really love Lila and Ethan though. Ethan's my boo. 
 Micha's a sap, but I still kind of love him too."
5,"This was such an amazing and powerful story, I don't even know what to say! 
 ""My husband says that evil will rule until good men or women choose to act. I believe him. This testimony was written to create an absolute record, to speak in a world where our voices have been extinguished. These writing may shock or horrify you, but that is not my intention. It is my greatest hope that the pages in this jar stir your deepest well of human compassion. I hope they prompt you to do something, to tell somone. Only then can we ensure that this kind of evil is never allowed to repeat itself."""

 I enjoyed Cryer's Cross. It was an interesting read once you got a couple chapters into it. Must admit I skipped through the first five or six chapters to where Nico gets kidnapped. 
 Even though he wasn't there long, Nico was hands down my favorite. I was rooting for him. Jacian was a close second though, he reminds me of someone I once knew. So troubled, lol. 
 It was entertaining and creepy but...NICO! My god! I was really holding out hope for him. I wish he HAD been kidnapped. Why did he die? I'm truly sad about that. I feel so bad for Kendall, had it been me I would not have been able to keep it together after finding my best friend dead like that."
5,"This is one of the best books i have read this year! 
 Loved it! The writing is straight-forward and simple. It is actually more like diary. 
 The story tells a 30-something-year old guy who has been spending most of his time at a mental institution which the main character(Pat Peoples) refer it as 'The Bad place'. When he is free to go, Pat continue living with his parents discovering literature, broken relationship, neighbor and changes that he has missed out. When one of his neighbors introduced him to a woman called Tiffany, who is also in the same situation as Pat (a bit cuckoo) . Pat discovers a whole new world where determination is important. 
 5 stars!!"
2,"Started out strong and had enough interest to keep me reading, but about half way trough it really started to go downhill. The story became boring and too repetitive, too predictable."
3,"Fast read - definitely kept picking it up. Lots of sex. Too much maybe. I found myself eye-rolling at these two - ""here they go again."" I can see the fanfic elements, but I'm not sure if that's because I knew to look for them. Yes, it's clearly modeled off another famous dysfunctional relationship, but I don't think it's that big of a deal. It's heavily derivative, but it's a story that sells, so I completely understand why it's out there. ""I'm a plain inexperienced girl, and all of a sudden insanely hot rich powerful guy is lusting after me."" Gee, why does that sell?!? :P 
 Pseudo porny thrills for those that want them. Debating reading the other two in the series... but I probably will."
4,"First of all, look at that cover. On second thought, if you're afraid of spiders, cover your eyes and scroll on by. I really like it, and I don't normally take much notice of book covers. Pictures don't usually do much for me; I'd rather have 1000 words. But apparently I like pictures of books with holes that have book-page-spiders crawling out of them. Who knew? 
 This book is the sequel to John Dies at the End. Each book tells a complete story that stands on its own, although there are some fun references to the first book that would go over somebody's head if they hadn't read it. This second book has the same crazy humor combined with goriness, crudeness, and silliness, but I did think it was toned down a little bit as compared to the first book. On the other hand, I've now read almost 900 pages of this author's writing, so I may have just built up an immunity. Or brain damage. 
 I didn't think this plot was as unique and strange as the first one, but it still had its own unique flare and it was told well. In fact, I may have been more absorbed by this story simply because it wasn't quite so bizarre. It definitely wasn't devoid of craziness and fun, though. With this book I don't see much harm in a brief synopsis, as long as I leave out all the juicy details: The story is basically about the zombie apocalypse coming to a small town in the Midwestern U.S., but with the not-really-zombies caused by not-exactly-spiders. Normally I hear the word ""zombie"" and reflexively reply with the word ""ugh"", but this isn't one of those tedious types of zombie/monster stories. I get bored if a story primarily consists of characters running from scary monsters, finding a temporary refuge, getting found by scary monsters, and running from scary monsters again. This book has an actual story, and it never once felt tedious. 
 The first book had been told primarily from the first-person perspective of the narrator. In this book, our main characters aren't together for large portions of the story so the reader gets to spend some time in the heads of the other main characters. I enjoyed that because I felt like I got to know those characters better, and I enjoyed not being confined to a single viewpoint and a single chain of events. On the other hand, I wished the characters were together more often because I think they're more fun that way. 
 One semi-spoilerish comment: (view spoiler)[It seems pretty pointless to persist in calling the town ""Undisclosed"" to discourage tourists, considering the entire world has been watching news about it for days. The town is likely to be a household name for years. But then, the narrator does make references to potential readers 200 years from now, so maybe he's trying to prevent tourism in 200 years. :) (hide spoiler)] 
 In summary, there were some things I liked better about this book as compared to the first book, and some things I liked less. On average, though, I think I enjoyed them about equally. I may have to check out some of the author's other work someday."
3,"A Self help book for someone who DOES NOT like Self help books. 
 Someone like Me. 
 Lilly Singh is pretty entertaining and one of my favourite YouTuber but I admit that I NEVER expected that I would read her book because - 
 1. I dont like Self help books, they are just downright boring and I ve noticed that It doesn't really motivate me long enough to follow it through. 
 2. I never considered Lilly Singh mature enough to be writing a self help book in the first place ! 
 3. I have a Mom ! Who takes that job very seriously, I get lectured every other day . 
 Why I picked up this book 
 So coming to why I picked up this book is because I saw it at this bookshop and its got a magazine like appearance with glossy pages and loads of funny pictures inside,the first page of this book intrigued me because it said - 
 The book is not a survival guide filled with hopeful thoughts,lucky charms or fluffy quotes. There will be no secret schemes to a rewarding life found in these pages. Thats because success, happiness and everything else that feels great in life have no escalators. There are only stairs. This book will be your personal trainer, guiding you up those stairs. Start Stretching . 
 What I felt about this book 
 The writing style is very original and Lilly like so much that I pretty much read the whole book in Lilly's voice, Its not pretentious at all but the content isn't very insightful, I loved the examples and real life situations she put up and the way she handled it. The book is meant for someone in their late teens to age thirty because there is a lot of Pop culture reference and Social media fad content which might be hard to relate for someone who isn't updated with any of these. 
 Conclusion 
 Most content of this book isn't new , it isn't something you have never heard of before from your Parents,teachers,relatives or even friends but what makes it unique is how Lilly presents it and makes it all motivating and funny at the same time with her quirky ways . It is Immature and the writing style isn't very fancy but then I wouldn't have finished the book ever if it wasn't like that in the first place . 
 There is zero value added but then there is no shortcut to success as per the book, It has a Practical and a go getter approach rather than the introspect and learn version that most self help books offer."
4,"41/2 stars. There's nothing better than a well-written book ending. It might not have been what I was hoping for, but it was beautifully done."
5,"** spoiler alert ** 
 Again, Daemon was to die for! Once they decided to start dating, Daemon has completely changed into this sweet overprotective person. What he did for her at the lake after Senior Prom was so sweet. He knew how important blogging meant to her he even went to the library with her to use the computer, later he bought her MacBook Air! As a book lover, I really want to have a Daemon for myself. The way he called her Kitten *swoon* there seemed to be something different before they started dating. Before, it was like he teased her. Now, it was full with affection. I barely remember he was a jerk before. This was feel so good to read. 
 Back to the story, Blake oh Blake, I think he really liked Katy. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to not betray her. I'm glad that Dee finally came around. I think it was because when Ash tried to touch Onyx and they realized that what the others did was huge. Dee thought of Andrew as a friend but I'm pretty sure the feeling wasn't mutual. 
 I have to say that sometimes I need to went back and read the name again to see was it Daemon or Dawson. Because when I get into the story people's names sometimes get blur and I just register the first two or three letters to know who is it. 
 I'd like to use Katy's words from this book; a brutal cliffhanger ending! This book had a brutal cliffhanger ending! OMG! How could she end the book like that and this time I don't have the next book at my arm reach! I need to wait at least two weeks. This is so hard. It was like they were back to square one. They got Beth but the Daedalus got Katy, a new shiny toy with more powerful. Apparently the problem with Will had been solve, so that means in the next book they will be dealing with the DOD and Daedalus directly. 
 I almost cried at the end when Daemon told her he loved her. I can't wait for my book to arrive!!"
5,"4.5 stars!! 
 I can admit it... I haven't really read a lot of time travel books, so I was a bit leery going into this. I don't know what I was thinking. I absolutely loved it. 
 Anna lives in 1995 in Chicago. 
 Bennett lives in 2012 in San Francisco. 
 They were never supposed to meet. 
 Bennett has an incredible ability to travel through time. There are a few catches to the whole process, but as long as he stays within the years he's been alive, he's never had any trouble, and I thought this was a wonderful twist to the story. 
 He shows up in Chicago in 1995, seemingly out of nowhere. Anna first encounters him on the bleachers while she runs one morning, only Bennett says it wasn't him. The bulk of the story takes place during this time period and it was wonderful to relive all the things that were going on back then... the music references and concerts! 
 After something happens that forces Bennett to spill his secrets to Anna, they grow closer. I couldn't help but feel nervous for these two, simply because Bennett was somewhere he wasn't supposed to be and Anna was falling for him completely. 
 I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with this information. Tell him to leave? Tell him to stay? But I don't have time to consider any other alternatives, because he scoots in closer and brings his hands to my face, and I fall back into the bookcase as he kisses me with this intensity-like he wants to be here, and if he kisses me just long enough, deeply enough, none of what he just said will actually be true. And as much as I know it's all true and that it's incredibly stupid to feel this way about someone who doesn't belong here-who, when he leaves, will hardly be a plane ride away-my hands leave the Berber carpet, find his back, and pull him toward me until I'm flat against the shelves. Because he's here now. And because I'm pretty certain I don't want this to stop. Ever. 
 After something happens and both Bennett and Anna test his abilities by changing the past and breaking his personal rules for his ability, I swear I read with a ball of nerves resting in my stomach, waiting for something to happen. I mean, they are messing with fate and I've seen that movie The Butterfly Effect. Just saying. 
 I really enjoyed the characters - definitely Anna, while I found myself a bit angry with her a few times, I thought she was written really well. I did find myself emotionally attached to her and her feelings so she obviously worked for me. 
 Bennett, once we got to know him was sweet and protective and caring and while their relationship wasn't born of the normal, he made the effort to try and give her the normal as well as the spectacularly grand and unbelievable. 
 One thing I would have liked to know more about is the manifestation of his ability. We get a brief explanation, which works for the book, but being naturally curious you wonder if there is anyone else like him, who has this talent as well ... where did it come from, why him... those kinds of things. I myself would have a hard time accepting the ability without doing tons of digging and trying to find out why me. 
 I also would have liked to know what happened with Anna in her previous life... why in the prologue does she give him the letter and what made her first choice not the right one for her. 
 I think what is most intriguing about this book is the idea of time travel itself and changing history... 'what if' ... what if you could have made a different choice in life, what if you could change the outcome of an event. All these things are intriguing and can't help but make you as a reader think of the way things might be different in your life if only... 
 Once I started this book it was hard to put down, like I said, I turned page after page nervous for these two while reading. If you're looking for a sweet contemporary YA romance than this is just the thing for you. 
 This review can be found on my blog, Fic Fare:"
3,"Getting slightly tired of main character, who never thinks things through, and this was before Cabot stopped explicitly foreshadowing how dumb her main character's ideas are; regardless, still fun and clever."
4,"well for once the angel who falls in love is a girl!! unfortunately that was the only new element this book had to offer. But i'm not complaining. it is quite well written and Beth being so innocent, naive, fragile, emotional sensitive but strong when things get difficult( it is more clear in the second book of the series Hades) makes her one of my favourites character. Xavier is great too and i wish that this book was out when i was 15 so i could really have a good role model and not the badboy/dangerous-to-hang-out-with/self-destructing type which was so popular 3 years ago. the plot is ok. it reminds a bit of the immortals series by alyson noel cause both Beth/Xavier and Ever/Damen are having troubles sent by the universe lol!!!! Oh!!! one more thing. at last Xavier is an original name. not like the other books where you can only read about some Damon/Damien/Damen guy. i still can't remember the exact name of these books, i always get comfused. so all in alla it's a great read and i strongly recommend the series"
4,"It was kismet the time I read this book - the day after I watched 'The Force Awakens'... because the whole story takes place while the main characters are waiting in line for the cinematic opening for the sequel in the franchise. 
 I was a big Star Wars fan growing up - the films were a big part of my childhood, so I got just as excited as our Vietnamese protagonist Elena. Especially since I had only just watched the movie and was just about flipping my wig. I related to her excitement and enthusiasm. She is also a blogger and a little socially inept - it was like Elena was singing to my soul. Some of the discoveries she makes through this short story also mirror my experiences in life - I was a bit unobservant about the world around me, even in a small town. Rowell really hit the mark with her characterisation. 
 Gabe, her 'line-mate' also is a lot like how I was in junior high, quiet, and a computer nerd - even though the whole world is a nerd these days. Oh how times have changed... and how they haven't. I found Gabe just as endearing as Elena. This whole book is just so cute. 
 This is a great contemporary short - it has everything I love about the genre and Rainbow Rowell's writing. (It also helps that she's tapped into my fav fandom of all time.) Complex characters with intricate backgrounds you get glimpses of, and a discovery of self, and the cast twisting everything into a different light by the completion of the story... with a promise of more. 
 You also get a strong feel of how this movie franchise draws generations together - the original trilogy and the new direction of current releases. It also highlights how lovers of this franchise show their support. In the past we did line up for hours (*cough* days) for a cinematic release, where nowadays it's more present online. The physical (in-real-life) expression has diminished to themed parties and expo's. 
 Definitely a book I'd recommend to everyone - even if it isn't something you wouldn't normally read. I mean, c'mon, it's short, and might actually share something truly unique with you about one of the biggest pop culture events of the century."
5,"What a great ending to the series! Despite even more deaths of even more beloved characters, I loved this one and think it's the best of the bunch. Tied up all the loose ends and was perfectly satisfying. 
 7/23/2015- Just finished my second reading of the series. For most of this book I questioned my original 5-star rating; it was good, but 5 stars? Then I got to the end. ""You have been so brave."" Ack. Oh, yeah. 5 stars."
4,"Review posted on Between Reality 
 Alright Estes, no need to beg on your knees, I'll write a review for the first book in the Slip trilogy. (Merely a joke to do with his message to the reader) 
 Slip took me on a fascinating, but often confusing journey through yet another dystopian world. The United States, now renamed Reorganized United States of America, has a new population control method that, according the statistics, works flawlessly. Unless...until, there is an UnBee, or Unauthorized Being, or, even worse, a full-blown Slip. 
 The rabbit hole never seems to end in this book. There is so much secrecy, so many lies, so many hidden motives and identities, that sometimes I would just be plain lost. Why is this guy like that? Who has this name? Why do they have the same name? Wait what? But by the end, ""all was revealed"" and every loose end, every unexplained mystery made painful perfect sense...

2,"So, I guess this is it. I've just read my first Neil Gaiman book, and I'm so sorry to say that I disliked the work of such an appreciated and recommended writer. I found this novel extremely strange and messy, but not in a good way, not in the Terry Pratchett kind of way. 
 Am I the only one here who feels like Gaiman was focusing on the least interesting character? I mean, this guy has his issues, but what about the witches on the farm? What about Lettie and her mum and her grandmother? I want to hear about them, not about this dude. 
 Maybe I started off badly with Neil Gaiman's work. I'm sure that in this universe, there's at least one of his books that I will appreciate and that will suit my soul."
3,"Where She Went picks up three (long) years after the first book If I Stay. Adam is now a rock superstar while Mia is a musical virtuoso. In three years, these two have come a long way but what really did transpire between them? 
 Mia left Adam. 
 It was the hardest thing that she could do and it did nothing but destroy him and made him write songs - songs that hit off his musical career. 
 ""First you inspect me. Then you dissect me. Then you reject me. I wait for the day that you'll resurrect me."" 
 I gush over If I Stay. My looooong review about it can prove you that and while I enjoy reading its companion novel, I think it felt a little off track as to what I'm expecting, but I'm not saying that I didn't like the book, I guess it just didn't reach the feels that I got when I read the first book. 
 Adam was so much different. Mia's description of the boy she loved who is willing to do anything for the girl he loves doesn't give him justice. There is definitely more to Adam Wilde's life. I don't know why he's terrified of fame but one thing that can be easily seen was the hurt he feels inside. 
 Where She Went is not entirely about Adam's struggles in losing Mia but it was more on what really happened to him and Mia to cause them to drift apart from one another? I waited long enough and I had my suspicions here and there but when the answers came when in one random night, these two reunited, reconnected and recollected. It felt like the right piece for the puzzle. It makes sense. It seals the deal. It made me see their both side of the relationship. 
 Yes, there are a lot of heart-tugging moments here and there especially with Adam and Yes, I do like getting into Adam's thought but I just wish that this book consist more of the present time or the real narrative itself. Flashbacks are okay and yes it build bridges between the thoughts of Anna and Adam but it seems like it dominates the majority of the book that at the end, I find myself not quiet satisfied with how things have gotten. But I do appreciate the little moments they had with each other and reminiscing their early memories. 
 Where She Went is a good companion novel; it gives us the closure and the happy ever after we're all longing for Adam and Mia."
4,"The Underground Railroad is an excellent, yet difficult account of an imagined Underground Railroad that is an actual railroad. The fantasy elements end there though. It is the story of Cora, who upon learning of the railroad escapes the particularly brutal plantation she is on after a bad beating. Knowing nothing of her future destinations, she and another slave set out to find freedom and safety. 
 This is not an easy book to read, which I think is an important element of it. It is violent, and brutal, and full of some truly horrifying images I won't easily forget, but I think that is the point. This brutality was real and escaped slaves, even those who managed to get out of the south, were still in danger of being brought by slave catchers. The fear really never subsided, and perceived safety was a danger in itself. 
 Colson Whitehead has written something important here, and I am very curious to read his other (very different from this) books."
4,"4.5 stars 
 I love everything about Cruel Beauty. I don't know why it took me so long to read this, but I'm glad that I finally did. I was crushing on Shade through out the whole book, then Ig. I resorted icalling him Ig because his name is hard to remember. I was rooting for Ignyx (it's probably not their ship name, but oh well). 
 I loved the writing, characters, and the world...especially the world. I can't decide who I love the most 
 ...okay that's a lie. Ig is my favorite and I feel a little wrong for doing so, but I just can't help it 
 I didn't like Nyx sometimes, but I got over it around chapter 15 or so, so you can image how I felt about that one chapter. I screamed and called her names. 
 From chapter 24 onwards, I was like, What is going on? I absolutely love it even though I was a little confused. Definitely one if my new favorites that I would re read over and over again"
3,"Hmm. I made no notes about this, which I think means it was okay, but I didn't love it enough to praise it."
5,I love love love this book! It seems to be an exciting new series with an intriguing concept of superheroes! Trance and Gage were great characters to really start the book off. The twist in the end was definitely unexpected. Definitely a must read. Kelly Meding never disappoints!
2,"I've seen and enjoyed the film version of Austenland, so after a five month slog re-reading A Song of Ice and Fire, this is where I turned for a bit of a palate cleanser. It's certainly light reading - I was done with it within four hours - and that's mostly what kept me going after a very shaky beginning. This isn't a well-written book, and when the blurb at the end revealed that the author's previous works are all Young Adult, that made sense. But the premise is just such a fun idea, it's hard not to get swept along with it. I think this is a rare occasion where the film improved upon the book."
4,"3.75 stars 
 Overall I enjoyed this just as much as the first book. Differently to the first book though I didn't really enjoy the first half as much as I loved the second half."
5,"TEN BILLION STARS. The only negative I can think of is that it's quite a slow read, but HOLY FEELS, BRIGAN. ALSO BRIGAN. AND BRIGAN. PLUS BRIGAN."
5,"I can't believe how much I love these books! I love how all the characters are fitting together so perfectly! I'm absolutely amazed by Meyers ability to write! Can't wait to start the next! And for Winter to come out! 
 If you haven't read these books, then get to it ASAP!"
4,"""When I lie this close to you, when I smell your scent, when I hear your voice, I know everything that matters."" She looked down the length of him. ""You are the male I want to mate with. That's who you are.""-Marissa 
 The fourth book in the Black Dagger Brotherhood has a lot going on! There were many plot twists and turns. There is continued underlying sexual tension that V was feels for Butch. Although I believe it is so much more than just about a physical attraction V feels for Butch, the tension was high. It made me a little sad for him which made it a bit distracting to stay focused on our hero making things right with our heroine. 
 While V is battling his inner demons, we witness John and the young Black Dagger trainees finding growing stronger and developing. The next generation is being born. Who wouldn't want to be a fly on the wall in that training center? 
 And then there is Marissa. She has been floundering. She has been disgraced by the upper echelon and left her alone. She is like a fragile bird that doesn't seem to have the strength to just fly away. 
 Butch, the cop, has been a strong character in the series. Despite the happiness he feels with his brothers, he hates being alone. When it comes to his feelings for Marissa, he has always had a strong connection to her. She broke his heart when she didn't his calls for so many month. 
 Butch gets himself into some serious trouble. One night changes his life forever. Butch is left injured and sick, and yet at the same time the incident has drawn him closer to V. It is also the moment that brought him back into the arms of Marissa. 
 ""He stroked some of her hair and thought hat everything was right in his world. Butch O'Neal, he thought, you have found your woman.""-Butch 
 The intimacy between Marissa and Butch was explosive. I felt breathless after reading the pages surrounding their time in the bedroom. It was such a delight to see them finally together. 
 What worked for me in this read? The way that Butch was able to find his true calling. The dynamics between the brotherhood continue to intrigue me. While they grow closer together, they have become much more distinguishable as their own entity battling their individual demons. I truly loved seeing Z. The healing that has taken place since Bella become part of his life is remarkable and I could read all day about those two! Not only does Butch find his way in this book but Marissa is ""reborn"". She is able to push aside all of the ugly she has experienced and embrace her new life and a strong independent woman. 
 ""All right , then , her first rule for the rest of her days : no more looking outside for definitions. She might not have any clue who she was, but better to be lost and searching than shoved into a social box by someone else.""-Marissa 
 What did not work for me was the constant back and forth between Marissa and Butch. In theatre we often use a technique in blocking known as advance/retreat. The purpose of this blocking strategy is to build tension and add intensity to the conflict in the relationships of the characters. I felt that the back and forth between Butch and Marissa became a little redundant towards the end of the book. 
 ""She took a sip from her water glass and marveled at how you could sit so close to someone and still have him be totally far away from you."" 
 There was so much advance/retreat between these two that when things were finally settled I felt more than blissful relief. I was happy that it was finally done. 
 Overall, I would recommend this series to anyone who likes passion, action, romance, and paranormal elements. Although Butch and Marissa wasn't my favorite of the series, I still enjoyed their story. For me, I will celebrate the transformation that Butch was able to make in this book and look forward to the next BDB book! Bring on V! This gals hoping for a HEA for him!"
2,The strength of this story lies in the vivid world created by the writing. Bankok feels alive and many of the environmental messages are pretty clear. Sadly the Characters have no vibrance and drag what would otherwise be a great novel down.
5,"I really loved this book! After enjoying Divergent but feeling Insurgent was quite a let down I wasn't expecting much here but I was very impressed. 
 After a fairly light first two books this one felt like it delved deeper into issues like discrimination, government propaganda and how much should be sacrificed for ""the greater good"". The expanded world really helped flesh out the story and the lack of page after page of on again, off again romance didn't hurt my view either. 
 I can see why this story was not at all well received by fans as it is quite different from the rest of the series, but for me this is exactly what I was looking for."
5,"I think that ""Son of Neptune"" was even more epic than ""Lost Hero"". First, it was amazing to be following Percy again even if we weren't in his head. (I generally don't like first person point of views so the fact that I miss seeing things as Percy does is rather telling of the genius that is Rick Riordan). Second, I think that Hazel and Frank are just amazing. Hazel's story is both inspiring and heartbreaking... and I think that Frank's family lineage is just downright cool. Third, the entire concept of this story was intriguing. The journey to Alaska to free Thanatos from the Giants was just so epic. And... the ending was awesome. I was so thrown by that cliffhanger, I immediately dove into Mark of Athena. Oh! And while I started reading this book on my Kindle app, I finished it in hardcover format. I plan on reading the rest of the series with a good old-fashioned book in my hands. ^_^ Bottom line... Riordan is a genius and I adore this universe of his."
2,"I used to really love this series, but unfortunately somewhere along the line I have grown bored :( 
 Everything is pretty much the same in every book, it just switches villains. They make an enemy, they play mind games with them, they come out victors. Secrets, lies, and unspoken tension threads through the group threatening to rip them apart, but they stay together. I have a hard time believing people this young can be so manipulative and conniving."
2,"BEWARE STAR WARS FANS! BEWARE LORD VADER! 
 FOR A NEW ENEMY RISES. 
 BEHOLD! IT'S GENERAL ACKBAR-GREVIOUS! 
 I scared you didn't I? 
 I can't stop laughing at this guy. He actually thinks that he is going to kill Lord Vader and become the new dark power in the galaxy. Seriously though, this is pathetic. I mean fair enough on a character level he may be delusional, but I feel like in terms of the plot, this guy is actually being set up as Vader's nemesis. I mean come on. Look at him. Look at him. In what world could this weird amalgamation of Admiral Akbar and General Grievous actually have a chance against Vader? It's just ridiculous. It's like setting up a wrestling match between Chewbacca and Ja Ja Binks. It could only go one way. You're picturing that now aren't you? 
 Vader is far beyond such a contraption. The rest of the imperial enforcers are just as bad. Two are androids that think there are Jedi Knights. Vader will cut them down. Another is a tactical genius with a weird shaped head. Great description I know. Vader will force suffocate the life out of that fool in seconds. And the Grievous thing, the mon-calamari android, will just crumble before the might of Darth Vader. The situation is plausible, but these rivals could actually be threatening; they could actually have potential to slay Vader, that way the comic would be a little more intense because these guys are morons. 
 The main drive of this story is Vader's hunt for Skywalker. He has just realised that he is his son, which gives him another reason to hate his master. So, Vader's on his own; he is forced to us his own recourses and find his own allies. His personality isn't going to win anyone over, so he uses his only tool: power to induce fear. He's bound a young doctor his cause, which will, no doubt, eventually end in her demise. I wouldn't trust Vader. I wouldn't go within a mile of him. 
 This wasn't as good as the first volume; it lacked the drive and focus of its predecessor. Most of the side characters are terrible, though there is an interesting imperial investigator assigned to Vader. He might make it to the end of this series, hopefully. Most imperials are just cannon fodder so he has a good chance of survival. I'm hoping the story picks up again and that these ridiculous rivals to Vader are killed off soon. Otherwise I may not read too far into this series.

3,"I'm wavering between 2 and 3 and maybe even 4 stars on this book... I really don't know how I feel about it. It took me forever to read, but then I've been really busy this month, so I'm not sure that's entirely fair - although I do think it would've taken long no matter what since 100 pages could've been cut from this, easy. But it was... weird, and I don't mean the premise (but maybe I do, in a way). I mean the story, the way it unfolded (slowly meandered, in a lot of places), the weird (unnecessary) number of POVs and random shifts into omni... I don't know."
5,"My favorite stories were El Destinos, The Red Raven Ball, Bonnie and Clyde, City of Angels, Pulse of the Panthers, The Legendary Garrett Girls, and The Whole World Is Watching"
5,Wow! I'm speechless. Best Book in the series so far. Looking forward to the finale.
3,"I really really love the character of Rafe. Love and adore him. Eloisa James is one of my favorite authors so it kills me to say this because I was really looking forward to reading this. I was disappointed with this one and it's only because of the plot and set up of the story and how it was dragged out. Still a great read I'd recommend it but compared to the other in the series this was disappointing for me. 
 *SPOILER ALERT* I really liked the idea of Rafe's long lost brother Gabe coming into the mix and making things interesting but what I thought made the story go a little stale for me and dragged out was Rafe disguising himself as his brother to fool Imogen throughout the whole book. It drove me nuts how she kept thinking it was Gabe she was with and made love to him thinking he was Gabe. It just made me cringe. How can you profess to love a man when you don't know he's someone else? And then to only find out she knew at the very end made it all the more frustrating because I wanted to know WHEN exactly she found out. The author never revealed that part and I think it was a very vital piece to the story. I felt totally shafted. I felt cheated cause you keep thinking the heroine is completely oblivious and freaking clueless the whole time only to find out she knew all along. Whaaaat? I would have much rather have had her find out and reveal it and them getting to spend genuine time together without games or disguises or lies. These two have a very volatile history so I really wanted to see them just be together openly without lies or disguises surrounding them. Beside that it would have made for an awesome book if we saw the two bickering and arguing like they have throughout the series and just go from there. The whole 'in disguise' angle while clever, kind of muddled up the story for me. I just did not like how the author went about these two falling in love. It's surrounded by a bunch of tricks and lies."
5,"A creepy story story about Anya, a normal girl with a normal life. Then one day, she accidentally falls into a well. There she meets a girl. Not a human girl. A ghost girl. 
 This is a graphic novel. And it was awesome. I usually prefer novels, not graphic novels. But some graphic novels are so awesome. And some are actually based on novels, like the Coraline one. I've never actually read the novel. I've read the graphic novel like a million times and I've seen the movie like twice, but never read the book itself."
1,"If this library book hadn't been the beautiful brand-new copy that is was, I would not have finished it. I would not have read more than 20 pages."

 *I received this copy via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review* 
 As a huge fan of Kresley Cole and her Immortals After Dark series, I was interested to see what this new book would be about since it was a contemporary romance. 
 From the first chapter I was fascinated by Natalie and her ""manalyzer"", managing to figure out every guy in the bar just by watching them for a few seconds. That is, apart from Sevastyan who she can't read and instantly catches her attention. Things quickly move along after this and she get's spirited away to Russia to meet her family, but not without a few hot-and I do mean HOT-scenes between her and Sevastyan. 
 One thing I did like about the book was that the author didn't do the typical Mafiya man as Natalie's dad. In fact, I quite liked the man that was described; he seemed like a nice guy who had a love of clocks and family. 
 For the first half of the book it was kind of serene, everything was going well. Okay, that's not quite true. There's a sexual tension between Natalie and Sevastyan that despite the distance they've put between them is only growing and I have to tell you I couldn't wait for it to blow. 
 I feel about now that I should mention that I'm not the hugest fan of erotica; I tend to get bored of the continuous sex. Depending on what's going on and how much I like the characters is how I judge the scenes between them. I happened to like both Sevastyan and Natalie and the sex between them but the dirty talk while in bed always had my eyes rolling. That, I'm not a fan of. 
 After the half way point it seemed to concentrate more on the sex and the BDSM lifestyle, which I found a little boring after a while. BDSM is not one of my favourite things to read about and in small doses I don't mind but it took up a fair bit of the book. 
 With about 15% to go, I got a little excited as some information came out that had me wondering what Natalie would do with it. Relationship difficulties coming to a head I wanted to know how it would all play out. And after another round of sex, we found out some things about Sevastyan's past. 
 I'm glad I read this, simply because Kresley Cole is a great author and I was interested in reading something of hers that wasn't paranormal. I read books for the romance and like to see it happening on paper/screen. The first half was great, it just wasn't quite for me with all the sex and BDSM themes running through. If you're a fan of it, then I'd check this out."
4,"4.25 stars. Stephanie writes the cutest, most charming and romantic stories, but always with a sliver of pathos in them. This is probably the fluffiest of all the 3 books in the series, but sometimes it's ok for the conflict to be ""slight"". These kids are young, rich and good-looking, but it doesn't mean they don't suffer from crushing insecurity, blinding arrogance or wild immaturity -- the same things we all suffered through in our youth. I'm married to a creative person, so Josh's personality, with his artistic flourishes, spoke to me in a personal way. I also loved seeing characters from the last 2 books and it was fun seeing how they were incorporated into this final installment. Loved this!"
4,"Finley and the gang head across the pond to New York City to help their friend Jasper, who's in a bit of trouble: Before coming to England, he stole a dangerous device from a criminal, took it apart and hid the pieces all over the city. Now said criminal wants it back, badly enough that he didn't just sent people to pursue Jasper all the way to London and bring him back but also took Mei, the girl Jasper loved and left behind in the US, hostage to ensure he'll cooperate. Faced with the threat of Mei's death, Jasper has no choice but to comply - but some unexpected assistance in form of Finley, Griffin, Emily and Sam is headed his way. 
 Griffin is still an acting like an idiot in about 90% of his interactions with Finley, Sam is still an unlikable asshole, and I missed Jack, my favourite character from the first book, a lot, but apart from that I enjoyed the book a lot. Fast-paced, entertaining steampunky fun - I don't care much for any of the romance subplots so far, but I do have a lot of practice in ignoring annoying love triangles and other such silliness, leaving me with another good, quick read."
5,"Oh my god, this book-I can't even... 
 The ending of Opal was both fantastic and cruel-the cliffhanger was heartbreaking, but at the same time it left me needing more. Thankfully, when I started reading this series, the first three books were out, and I only had like a month or so of a wait for Origin. But I loved that ending in the last book, and thought there was no way she could top it, but I was wrong-Jennifer L. Arementrout is a such an amazing writer, and I need to never forget that. 
 Origin is really different from the its predecessors in a good way-first off, this book is told through a dual narrative between Katy and Daemon which I loved. With Katy, we follow her journey-if you can even call it that-after she has been captured by Daedalus. It was so creepy and depressing because I have always found Katy to be a relatable narrator, and I felt as if I was stuck in that cell with her. Stripping someone of their freedom is the worst kind of death, and the beginning chapters were as difficult to read as they were interesting. There is so much that Katy learns, and like her, I didn't know what/who to believe. Daedalus claims that they are not the bad guys here, so then...who is? There's a lot of information being thrown at us, and it's hard to separate what is true and what is a version of the truth. I absolutely love all the Daemon chapters-whenever Jennifer would include a few chapters from Daemon's point of view in the earlier books, I always found them enlightening and it gave me a new perspective on certain scenarios-he's funny, charming, and the love he feels for Katy hits me right in the feels. I love how despite being madly in love, these two can still bicker and make fun of one another-it was unbelievably cute. 
 Secondly, I like the change of setting-we get to move around in this book a lot. The first three books take place in West Virginia, and while I love that little town, it was nice to take these characters out of their comfort zone. Speaking of change, we meet a whole bunch of new characters that really add flare into the already entertaining series. We also get to be reunited with old character, who bring new stories and secrets. 
 This last book is so action packed, it's like one thing happens after another after another-non-stop worrying, suspense, thriller-it's hard to take a breath in between chapters! 
 In true Jennifer L. Arementrout style, that ending....why? why? why? I have to wait another year to find out what the heck is going to happen? Just like Opal, the ending was cruel but genius nonetheless. 
 Be prepare to devour this book up in one sitting, and analyze like a crazy person-in the end, there are many different sides to one story, which one will you believe?"
5,"Wow, this is probably the first really good book I've picked up in a long, long while. The style and way of storytelling reminds me of Patrick Ness--and whoever knows me knows I absolutely adorePatrick Ness, so this is high praise indeed. 
 Book content warnings: 
 drowning 
 child death 
 After her (former) best friend drowns, twelve-year-old Suzanne ""Zu"" is determined to prove that she died due to the sting of a Irukandji jellyfish. 
 That's really the barest way to describe the novel, because this is really an exploration of child grief, isolation (and self-isolation) in youth, and a child's way of explaining the world, life, and death. 
 I wish we could have had confirmation that Zu was autistic, though, because as an autistic person reading this book, I was 100% sure she was like me. Growing up, Zu's problems were my problems, and her experiences were achingly similar to my own. But even without this confirmation, her character development and the way she's written is just so well done. I'd give anything for more books with characters like her. 
 I'm also touched that Zu's brother is LGBT with a boyfriend. Usually with side characters/brothers/best friends who are gay, it's just an add-in to grab some LGBT readers, and I just roll my eyes. But there's something different here, I don't know. There's something about how Zu's brother and his boyfriend are the most supportive characters; there's something about how damn healthy the relationship between her brother and his boyfriend is. It's written with such care and love that I don't mind it's a side relationship. I'm touched that it was included. That . . . never happens! 
 Anyway, this book taught me many things about life, grief, and jellyfish. I feel like I want to study jellyfish now! In any case, I'm definitely going to look up how I can somehow help jellyfish from taking over the seas. Or maybe get a poster of jellyfish to remind me that, yes, jellyfish are strong. They're forever. And that's pretty damn inspiring."
2,"** spoiler alert ** 
 2-1/2 stars. I liked the first half pretty well. I would give the first half three stars. After that it started to get a bit anticlimactic and I got bored. Especially with the ruggedly handsome vigilante hero type who always comes to the girl's rescue and saves the day, blah blah. 
 I'm kinda meh about vivid descriptions of sexual encounters in books. I don't feel like they add much to the story, and in this case there was too much of it for my personal taste. Add the casual treatment of adultery and unprotected sex and I was unenthused. 
 Early on, the book described Alice as being non-threatened by Emory's successes and it seems like someone who wanted to kill her would have shown a little more distaste for her. Then her husband wishes her dead too? It just seemed rather unlikely to me. Overall I thought the book started out well and then went downhill. It was kind of blah for me by the end."
3,"My final book of the readathon -- and yes, I slept somewhere in the middle of that. 
 Dodger is fun enough to read, but when you look back on it, I have to agree with other reviews that there isn't much substance. It's not funny in the way Pratchett usually is, and it belabors a couple of points for humour beyond the point of being funny. I agree, too, with some of the discomfort about the stereotypes of Jewish characters: Solomon is a good character in himself, and amusing, but the constant stereotyping did leave something of a bad taste. 
 Nonetheless, it kept me reading, and I enjoyed Pratchett's Dickensian London and his little jokes about Dickens' writing, so I can't give it too low a score. Perhaps it's better read not as a Pratchett novel, expecting humour and magic, but as a fun alternate history romp through the sewers of London -- and if you can't stop pondering Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere as you read, that might even add to it."
3,"I seriously couldn't connect with Allyson for the most part. By the time she stopped being a whiny teenager, I was already 65% through the book, and too late to convince me to like the book. Sorry to all the fans out there! 
 SERIES REVIEW: 
 Allyson and Willem's story started in the first book, Just One Day. A series of fortunate circumstances - serendipity, you might say - brought them together to spend an amazing day in Paris, and within twenty four hours, find love in one another. 
 To be honest, I was really hesitant to pick this up at first. I didn't really like the sound of Shakespeare in the synopsis. I only picked it up because of the endless gushing of bloggers and readers alike. I still can't say whether it was worth it or not. 
 On the first book, we got to see Allyson's side of the story. We got to see how she and Willem met, talked, and eventually went on a trip to Paris together. Before meeting Willem, Allyson was the shy goody-two-shoes, but then after just one day, everything changed and she became this whiny teenager that I really hated! It was like she wanted to inflict more pain to herself by thinking about crazy things. Because of this, I wasn't able to enjoy the first book so much. But then about the middle or so of the book, Allyson goes to college and meets Dee, which is the redeeming point. Of course, at first she was still a bitch, but then with the help of Dee, she finally puts herself together and stopped being the whiny teenager that I've come to hate so much. So thank you, Dee, for being that thing that salvaged the book for me, and for being one of the reasons why I continued on to the next book. I seriously couldn't connect with Allyson for the most part. By the time she stopped being a whiny teenager, I was already 65% through, and too late to convince me to like the book. 
 As I said, Dee was only one of the reasons. The second is that, I thought: Well, I got this far already! I couldn't just go on with another book without knowing Willem's side of the story! I felt a need to understand what really happened, so I dared to read the second book, and hoped that it would at least be a bit better than the first book. 
 Reading Willem's point of view is definitely a great change because I didn't have to deal with a whiny teenage girl anymore. It was refreshing, and it actually made me thankful for continuing on to the second book, despite not getting what the fuss was about the first book. Willem's POV definitely made things better, and I began to like the story. In Just One Year, we get to see what really happened that night in Paris. Why had he left Lulu, and had he tried to look for her? All things were answered in the second book and more. Willem's book is definitely the better of the two, and I even picked up a few wise words from him here and there. I really like the second book, which make me almost thankful for picking up the first one. Almost. 
 Overall, I don't get what all the fuss was about the first book, but I finally understood after reading the story in Willem's point of view. I guess it was just the whiny part that I didn't like about the first book, but you've got to admit, it's pretty much a big part of the book. I give the first book 3 stars, and the second book 4.5 stars."
1,"I'm only going to read the next two because I already borrowed them, otherwise I would have stopped. It's.. dull. Boring. Simplistic. Too simplistic."
3,Review coming up.
5,"This book is about a female character, Jo maybe (I don't really know what to call her), that is on the run after the death of her husband who fell onto the base of the stairs. 
 To be honest, I didn't think that I was going to like this book. The plot was slow and also quite confusing, I was wondering why would Tanya run away even though her name would be easily cleared after her husband's death. In addition, there are more and more old emails that add to the confusion. However, if you're at this point of the story, don't give up just yet because everything will clear up in the end - with a twist. 
 I LOVE the ending. It is a book full of mystery and questions, small ones, that keep on building up until the ending. The characters are definitely believable in this book, especially Jo. Her actions and feelings are given much thought and it makes me feel like she's a person I know in real life, not another superficial character in a fictional book. Another reason for liking the book is that I have a thing for stories on betrayals and this book has a great deal of that in it. 
 Initially, I would rate the book 3 stars but the ending bumps the ratings up to 4.5. A 5 star is given instead of 4 because it has been a while since I was so engrossed in a book (when approaching the end) that I refuse to put it down to go to the toilet. 
 This is my first book from Lisa Lutz and I definitely look forward to reading more of her books in the future! :)"
5,"Sexy, romantic, captivating and steamy!!! It's everything I love about the Blackstone Affair books and more! Best book in the series! 5 stars! 
 ""I could barely wrap my head around being in love with a man who'd stormed his way into my life audaciously and without apology, a mere two months ago."" 
 What is it about Ethan Blackstone? He is just the perfect alpha male--full of protectiveness, sexiness and romance! He's the kind of guy, so alluring and beguiling that can talk you into anything. 
 The book starts off with a bang -- quite literally -- and in a snap, I'm back into the intense world of Ethan and Brynne. We're immediately on the heels of what last happened in All In (book 2) with Ethan expressing just how fearful he was of losing her. He's so incredibly protective of Brynne, loving her with such a rapt intensity that like Brynne, notes, it can often be overwhelming. 
 ""Ethan's particular brand of attention was intense and a lot to accept at first, but it worked for me. Ethan worked for me."" 
 Eyes Wide Open is told through alternating Brynne/Ethan POVs and so more clearly understand the motivations and feelings of each person. In particular, we learn more about Ethan and his past, his reluctance and fear to share that ugly side of himself with Brynne. More than in the other books, we really see just how much these two people love each other... how perfect they are together. 
 ""Are you real? He whispered, brushing up my face with the back of his fingers in a cherishing caress. Because I'll want you forever."" 
 Despite that they haven't been together so long, and they've hardly taken things slow, they both deeply understand what the other needs. He instinctively knows how Brynne is feeling... with a simple look, he knows exactly what he needs to do. He makes her feel safe and loved, and guides her through those moments where she feels she's losing control. On the flip side, Brynne knows that Ethan uses intimacy as a way to regain control and escape the painful past that continues to haunt him. 
 I absolutely loved seeing how loving Ethan is with Brynne. He's everything us readers love in our alpha males! Sexy, passionate, gorgeous and with an unrelenting and fiery love for his girl. 
 ""Ethan made me feel desirable. He made me feel beautiful and sexy, from the words that came out of his mouth to the touch of his body in mine when he made love to me."" 
 But there's a major curve ball in the story that threatens to veer their relationship off track. Feelings of losing control and moving forward too quickly become too much for Brynne. Coupled with the mounting threat of someone after her, she begins to crack. Ethan tries to soothe her, instilling a sense of love, safety and optimism that everything will be alright and that they can surmount anything together. 
 ""I know I'm a bit rough around the edges and I know I've trampled my way into your life, but I do love you with all my heart."" 
 Overall, Eyes Wide Open is a seductive and passionate continuation of Brynne and Ethan's love as they face unforseen challenges and try to overcome all odds to stay together. The book felt intimate and full of emotion and the ending left me feeling happy and wanting just a little more (cue book 4!). Raine Miller has done an amazing job with these books, making it so easy for many of us to fall in love with these characters. I anxiously await book 4, out December, to see how their story concludes. 
 ""Are you ready?"" 
 ""Yes"" 
 ""And nothing changes us."" 
 ""Nothing changes that we love each other.""

5,"I made a quickie review of this the other day, and Goodreads must not have saved it. :( sigh. 
 Basically, I absolutely loved this book. I thought it was fantastic. Excellent humor, original and engaging storyline - this is one of those books where I not only MUST own the book for constant re-reading, but I need need need a sequel RIGHT NOW. 
 Definitely recommended for teens and fans of young adult lit."
4,"This is one of those romance novels that just grabs your heart in a vise and doesn't let go until it's over. Who am I kidding? I'm still thinking about this book. I loved this book, and I really wasn't expecting too. Brittainy C. Cherry is one of those romance novels that I always like, so I'm always willing to pick up her next book but the last ""romance"" novel that made me feel like this was In Between Here and the Horizon which I did a review on earlier this year. I've read alot of books between now and then, and this is one that I just couldn't pass up the opportunity to gush about. 
 Lucille is just a wonderful character, and I know she's a crazy hippie and is too emotional, but that's part of her charm. She also knows it, she's not naive she just doesn't want to waste her time being negative and unhappy. I can't fault her for that, at times it's annoying, but so is her opposite in this book. Graham is too dark and melancholy and I can't deny that he gets the right to be, but part of this book is how to grow past that. Lucy gets to learn how to not let people take advantage of her, and Graham gets to learn how to let people in. 
 The secondary characters were also absolutely brilliant, and I loved them all. Mari made me want to hug her, applaud her commitment to her sister, and at the end pull her hair out. She does come around though, and I can understand her actions here. It doesn't make them right, it just makes my heart break for her. Professor Oliver was also fantastic, and it made me wish for my very own kooky, optimistic old man back. The writing in this book was emotional and gripping. I clearly pictured what each of the characters were going though even Lyric, although I still think she's a terrible person. I am deviating from my tradition of romance novel ratings, and giving this book 4 out of 5 stars.

 Full review to follow when I can locate my review notebook that has all my notes in it. 
 *whispers* Go Team Shaw!"
3,"Once upon a time, I read Hyperbole and a Half in blog form. It was, essentially, the best thing I've ever read. And then my attention span for the internet waned (and my ability to read long blog entries) and I kind of fell off the bandwagon. 
 I'm glad it's in book form. My attention span can handle books, so this makes me happy. It's hard to read sometimes because it hits home. A lot. Feelings of worthlessness and trying to convince yourself you're not a shitty person and overall inability to be an ""adult."" I get you there. Though I'll admit I'm not a dog person, and dogs are featured a lot, so I kind of skimmed over those parts. 
 My only complaint really is that some of the stories just end with no real conclusion, but I suppose that's what happens with blogs. I'd turn the page expecting a concluding sentence or anything to make me feel complete, but I was left hanging a lot. 
 But really, it's fantastic. Even if it makes me feel uncomfortable. I have to go, like, volunteer somewhere now so I can stop feeling bad about how terrible of a person I am."
4,"4 stars, indefinitely, until I get hold of its sequel and reread the whole thing. 
 The attention to detail in this book is amazing. The astounding world-building, added to a solid cast of intricately defined characters, packs a 446-page punch without wasting a single word. 
 Just for the future me who can't quite remember what was so awesome about this book: 
 Elias Veturius, the best student in the graduating class of Blackcliff Academy, has never wanted this life as a killer. Against his better judgment, he accepts his title as an Aspirant in the Trials for the position of the new Emperor or Blood Shrike, the Emperor's second. But the Trials push his limits in strength, cunning, courage and loyalty, going way beyond his moral boundaries. 
 Laia of Serra is a frightened spy for the Resistance in the house of Blackcliff's tyrant Commandant, driven solely by her hope in the Resistance's effort to save her brother, Darin--the only family she has left. In so doing, she endures physical and emotional abuse, and grows into a hardened and determined person able to think around betrayals and setbacks. 
 What really scared me about this book was how good and evil weren't caricatured into the two-dimensional, black-or-white distinctions that most books make them out to be (view spoiler)[(well, maybe except for with the Commandant) (hide spoiler)]. Sometimes, they were impossible to tell apart, and I pretty much blew my brains out with my own indecision at the characters' dilemmas. Marcus and Zak weren't the snivelling, conniving, evil schemers I'd originally made them out to be--Marcus, especially, whom I was half-expecting to pull a Voldemort and (view spoiler)[condemn his brother for being weak as he felled him (hide spoiler)]. 
 ""You--you were like me. You were a child. A normal child. And that was taken from you."" 
 ""Does that bother you?"" 
 ""Well, it certainly makes you harder to hate."" 
 ""Seeing the enemy as human. A general's ultimate nightmare."" 
 What ultimately killed a star for me, though, was the incompleteness. The setting, the history, the complex web of relationships, the action... everything was in place, perfectly set for a thunderstrike, and then the book just... ended. I find it hard to believe this was ever a standalone novel--the ending left so many things to be resolved! And that huge, beautiful map on the inside front cover--so many unexplored lands, so many undiscovered secrets. And what happens to Darin? To the Resistance? To Teluman, Keenan, Cook, and the new Empire (view spoiler)[under Marcus' command (hide spoiler)]? Where do Helene's real loyalties lie, and how much is she prepared to give up for them? 
 An Ember in the Ashes was horrifying, wonderful and fast-paced, but for all its merits, it felt like one half of a story, without a proper conclusion of its own. No points for guessing which book is going on my asap list next :D"
4,"This modern classic appealed to me for various reasons: 
 The book won a Pulitzer, the author a Nobel Prize and I had never heard of either till recently. 
 It was written by an American expat, like me. 
 It is about the jedermann of China, which is a rare subject. 
 I'm really glad I bought the Simon & Schuster ""Enriched Classic"" edition of The Good Earth. It starts with a good forward which, along with a historical timeline, helps set the scene for the time period in which the novel is set and when Pearl S. Buck actually wrote it. The critical analysis at the end of the book also helped in my appreciation of the story. To me, the story at first seemed just to be about the rise of a poor family to wealth. The notes, however, made me appreciate some other aspects of the story, such as: the cyclical nature of life and events; chance & fate vs. cause & effect; how women do so much work but get so little of the rewards. 
 The book was really easy to read, no tough vocabulary, but I did encounter some interesting usages of very common vocabulary: 
 ""to be meet"" = to be proper (He did not think it was meet.) 
 ""to be like to"" = about to happen/on the verge of (His blood was like to boil.) 
 ""such an one"" = this was just strange...and it appeared frequently 
 In the end, it's hard to put my finger on what I liked about the book, but I did like it quite a lot. 
 I think I'll read more books from this Enriched Classics series. They really add good educational value. Well, this one did, at least."
5,"This was a fast paced, action packed edition in the series. It was tough to go to bed with 3 hours left to go in the story. Harry is hired to find a shroud. Turns out that it is not just wanted by its buyer, but other forces as well."
1,"Its worthwhile to note, that I am a geek by profession. This book was a serious blow to the image of Dan Brown that I held, the information was sloppy and not engaging, and the subject matter that I find passion in working with daily, I found souless and seriously out of date - even when published."
4,"When I first started this book 6 months ago I read the sample and I wanted to read more. I bought the book and soon after I found that I just didn't want to read a story like this one. Now everyone has been giving it fantastic reviews so I tried again. I am not sure what that changed in my head but I really like this story. I love that Olivia keeps fighting even at the end while acting like she gave in. I love that Caleb calls her kitten! I love the way I feel like the story is heading, if it doesn't then that's sad but I think it will. Cannot wait to read the next book!"
4,"It's easy mind candy. Lots of action, betrayal, power discovery, and unlikely friends. Two of the best parts is discovering who Franks really is and the villain Marty. 
 The pacing was good and the story was fun. I especially enjoyed it when they took on the old god. :)"

 A victim of the worst type of betrayal, Lokan Krayl was brutally murdered by someone close to him. Now his body has been reunited with his soul, but Lokan is still trapped in the Under way to contact his brothers or to protect his young daughter, who is still in the world of the living. Desperate to escape to both warn his brothers and to defend his precious daughter from the same danger and betrayal that he faced, he must travel through the Twelve Gates of one of his greatest enemies -- Osiris. 
 Years ago, desperate to escape her own situation, Bryn Carr tricked Lokan into fathering a child with her. Never really a true ""couple"", they bonded over their daughter, Dana. Lokan believes that the talkative Bryn is merely a human woman who has given him the gift of a child he thought himself incapable of siring, and that she believed him when he told her that he was the son of a Mafia boss. As it turns out, however, Lokan wasn't the only one hiding secrets, for there is much more to Bryn than meets the eye. As a Walker, Bryn has the unique ability to guide souls into any realm of the Underworld. Because of her knowledge and abilities, she is chosen to help guide Lokan through Osiris' Twelve Gates, but guiding a soul out of the Underworld is not the same as guiding one in... 
 I highly recommend reading the first three novels in the series, SINS OF THE HEART, SINS OF THE SOUL, and SINS OF THE FLESH, before picking this one up. While a lot of information from the previous books are summarized very nicely without getting in the way of this story, there's such a complicated balance between the characters that I truly think that new readers to the series might be doing themselves a disservice if they skip the previous books. Of course, the fact that I love the previous books in the series might also be coloring my opinion on the matter ;) 
 Despite a couple minor issues, I adored it. It was beautifully angst-ridden, thrilling and sexy. This was a perfect way to conclude this miniseries, and despite the rather abrupt ending that I've come to expect from Ms. Silver, I was quite pleased with the way the series' story arc was completed. Recommended for fans of the Otherkin series, a hero recovering from brutal betrayals, and a heroine determined to do whatever is necessary to protect those she loves no matter what the cost. 
 A very cheerful 4.5/5 Stars"

 The Hazards of Sleeping With A Friend is a pretty straightforward standard book that was sweet, cute, funny, light, and fun romance. Two friends who clearly have feelings for each other and yet they don't cross that invisible line. Jade has a crush on Kyle, but she doesn't do relationships. And she knows if things end badly, it would ruin their friendship. Well when Kyle's mom expected him to bring ""his girlfriend"" to their family outing, he had to ask his friend, Jade for a favor to be his pretend girlfriend. Well, we all know that will lead to one thing...HOOKING UP!!! It was inevitable for these two to cross that line of friendship when all it took was one hot kiss. Soon Jade and Kyle finds themselves having hot sex and can't keep their hands off each other. Feelings of love soon begins to bloom. Will Jade and Kyle finally admit that they have strong feelings for each other and change their status to boyfriend/girlfriend? Or will they only stay in the friend zone? 
 This was my first time reading a book from Alyssa Rose Ivy and I have to say this book was what I needed. It was light, fun, sexy, and sweet. Plus, I am a big fan of friends to lover stories. For all you sweet romance addicts, this book might be the book for you.

4,A unique combination of zombies and steam punk. I'm excited for the second one!
4,"Of the three novels in this trilogy, this one was the best-written, IMO. Several times I remember thinking, ""Wow."" The author really did a good job of balancing the somber mood of the impending visions with humor and love between the characters. It was also rather refreshing to read about the love between Clara and her parents when in too many YA novels today, the kids are so hurt and scarred, which may sadly be reality. Even though she did not grow up in your typical ""Leave It to Beaver"" family, she knew love and was able to reconcile with her father when told the truth. 
 The middle to three-quarters of the way through seemed kind of slow, though, even with all the action of the fire vision playing out. A lot of waiting that did not really make me anxious to turn the page. Reading how the ending panned out left me rather heartbroken for the loss that was the boy who didn't get the girl. The miracle at the end seemed also a little too neat of an answer to bring the two together. Perhaps I just need to make my peace with the loss in order to appreciate the bigger picture. :)"
5,"The Night Circus is more than just a book. 
 It's an experience. While reading it, you cannot help but live inside this world. You wait for the Circus to open with excitement. You wonder which tent(s) you will likely visit that night. You crave caramel apples and you swear you can almost feel the warmth from the fire cauldron. 
 The Night Circus is perhaps the most magical book I've ever read."

4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 I enjoyed maybe half of the plotlines, and the other parts were so-so. The book is 30% Payne/Manny, 30% Vishous/Jane, 20% Band of Bastards, 10% Qhuinn & 10% Veck. 
 Payne & Manny 4 stars for their adorable puppy love. 
 Payne surprised me. When she was first introduced, we were only shown her tough side. She's the daughter of a deity & a warrior. She's meant to be a fighter. Here, she gets some fighting scenes (killing some lessers, killing her father, protecting her man) but it's her softer side Ward focuses on. Hopefully, she'll get to be more kick-ass in the following books, but I enjoyed her softness. Lover Mine is a great book, but it's a harrowing story. I enjoyed the change of mood. Payne & her innocence utterly charmed me. I wanted to pinch her cheeks. I really loved the exploration of the themes of love, hope & healing in her plotline. Payne starts the story broken, everything has been taken away from her. She meets her beloved brother for the first time, but like all the people in her life he wants to put her in a golden cage. Manny is the only one able to help her. Not just as her physician, but also as a lover & a friend. He's a nurturer. He gives her hope. They heal each other. Because she heals him, too. He starts the story mentally broken. He's a hard, disillusioned man & her innocence, her purity cleanses his soul. Ugh, I feel so schmaltzy writing this, but these two have such a sweet relationship. They make a perfect team. Ward went overboard with the purity thing, though. Manny was stupidly obsessed with not taking Payne's virginity. I was sorry for my girl, but I liked how she took things into her hands at the end. That scene should've lasted longer, however. There should have been more Payne/Manny scenes in general. I know that Payne's healing power is cheesy, but whatever. That metaphor worked for me. Payne's last scene, smiling & basking in her freedom, surrounded by the people who love & accept her completely was perfect. I could feel & share her joy. She found her place in the world, at last. I'm so glad Manny & her found each other. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same thing for V and Jane. Grr. 
 Vishous & Jane 0 star for being more depressing than a pub with no beer. 
 While Payne & Manny were all sunshine & light, V & Jane were trying to win the medal for most dysfunctional couple in the series. Boy, oh boy. They are dreary. I was never a fan of them as a couple, but I thought they were doing okay. Nope. Ward shattered my illusions. They have huge problems. Simply put: V doesn't give a crap about Jane. Jane is melting into a puddle of self-loathing. V never fully committed to her. She's plagued by self-esteem issues. She was introduced in the series as a tough, confident woman. Now, after something like two years living with him, she's a shadow of her former self. A ghost, truly. Their relationship is just toxic & I wish it would end. I don't understand Ward's logic. Was I supposed to root for them to stay together after spending the whole book reading about how miserable they are together? Am I supposed to think they're fine now? Am I supposed to believe they can make it on their own? Or is Butch supposed to fix things next time, as well? 
 I was not happy with Butch, by the way. He should have minded his own business instead of coming to the rescue. I didn't like his talk about how he wouldn't let go of V & Jane. Let daddy & mummy divorce, man! Okay, I'm harsh. Butch acted as a friend, but still. Next time I hope he'll let them go. Sometimes a separation is for the best. 
 I didn't hate V in this book. His relationship with Payne melted my icy heart. Sure, he was an ass at the beginning. She's his baby sister & he was overprotective. But, he eventually put her happiness over his need to shelter her. That's the V I LOVE. The V who's warm & caring, who does what's good for those he loves. That's why he's my favourite character. Too bad he doesn't have that kind of love for his partner. 
 The Band of Bastards 4 stars for being promising, 5 stars for that hotel room threesome, and their awesome acronym. 
 Payne & Manny, as sweet as they were, weren't very hot. It's puppy love, remember? Ward raised the temperature with one of the sexiest scene in the whole series. That Hotel room scene with Xcor, Throe & Kandy rocked my socks. One year later, I'm still thinking about it. That's the moment I knew I loved Xcor & Throe. Besides the hotness, there's some really good characterisation going on in this scene. It reveals a lot about the dynamic between Xcor & Throe. These two have very conflicting feelings toward each other. Throe is still loyal to Xcor, but I predict that he will break free. I'm really interested in seeing how things will pan out. 
 The only problem I had with their plotline is that there wasn't enough action. The revelation at the end about Xcor's true purpose should have happened earlier. Payne's abduction was unnecessary. 
 I'm still excited about the BoB. They're every woman's friends :-D 
 Qhuinn 2 stars for showing up. 
 There's the Demon Baby! vision but other than that nothing really happens on the Qhuay front. Qhuinn runs a lot. In circles, mostly. Meh. 
 Veck 0 star for shameless advertising. 
 I love the Fallen Angels series, but throwing a random serial killer plotline in this book with the hero of one of the FA books was really in poor taste & annoying. 
 Plotholes, inconsistencies, irritating things... 
 Apparently, Ward has an editor. You wouldn't tell by reading her books. 
 Why was Manny sent to look for Payne? Vampires can't stand daylight, but trained Sympath assassin like Xhex can. 
 Why did Payne thought V was dead? She says that she's seen all is life in the Seeing Bowls. 
 Why was V so weird? I really had to use huge doses of suspension of disbelief to swallow that he would act this way. 
 Where was No'one? She's the heroine of the next book. She came here to take care of Payne. Where was she? 
 Where was the Scribe Virgin? There should've been a confrontation. 
 Do we really need another secret relative twist? Too cheesy. Even for me. 
 So, 
 I know I've criticised the book a lot, but I enjoyed it, despite its numerous flaws. Thought it was a fun read. I've always loved Ward's writing style. I gave it 4 stars mainly because of Payne & Manny. And that damn Hotel room scene."
4,"Although I had some niggling issues (why wasn't her name explained?), particularly with some of the ""Gilmore Girls"" aspects of the book, I thought this was an adorable, funny, and at times even thought-provoking entry in the inter-class romance genre (in the tradition of ""Pride and Prejudice,"" ""Pretty in Pink,"" and pretty much every story about a summer kid and a townie). The mother-daughter relationship wasn't nearly as strong (or healthy) as I wanted it to be, but the slow burn of the romance and the way Caymen (finally) realized that people are more than a pile of stereotypes was satisfying."
4,"4 1/2 stars. Definitely entertaining. 
 STORY BRIEF: 
 Six weeks ago angels attacked the earth, killing masses of humans. They are not typical angels. They are warrior-type creatures who regenerate and heal quickly, are stronger than humans, and can fly. Most roads are now full of abandoned vehicles. Remaining humans live in hiding. Penryn is 17. She lives with her 7-year-old sister Paige who can't walk due to a back injury and their crazy paranoid schizophrenic mother. Years ago when in one of her ""states,"" the mother used all the family's money and prepaid several years worth of self defense and martial arts courses for Penryn. Penryn never missed a class. Now her fighting skills help them survive. While on the run, they see a group of bad angels fighting Raffe. The bad angels cut off his wings. Then one of them grabs Paige and flies away. Penryn helps Raffe because she wants his help to find Paige. 
 REVIEWER'S OPINION: 
 Too many stories about angels, demons, and other paranormals are too much alike. The world building, powers, and plots are similar. This is creatively different. I liked the crazy demented mother and things happening around her. I liked the stories with Penryn and Paige. Several things surprised me, and that's why this is good. 
 It's the start of a series. The angel occupation still exists at the end of this book, but the ending was happy enough for me. There have been times when I would not read a book that had a cliffhanger ending, and I feared that might happen here, but this ending was acceptable. The good guys had a win even though the overall problems continue. (Like the Harry Potter books: each book had a resolved and happy ending.) I'm definitely buying the next book in the series. I hope the author will continue to have resolved happy endings for each book. 
 This book probably has more action than relationship development. There is an expectation that maybe a romance might happen in the future, but so far, Penryn and Raffe are not romantic. Although she does admire his good looks. They are helping each other. This book is a little shorter than a typical novel. There is some gore and occasional horror.

3,"I actually really liked the feistiness of the main character, without her losing depth. I think sometimes authors write the jokes and the ""I use sass to cover up my problems"" humour, and forget to actually develop a character. I also really liked how she wrote the poor character, and the interaction with the rich, as well as all characters' realizations that no one's lives are perfect, no matter how much they're idealized."
5,This book was absolutely amazing. I can't believe that this is a true story. The writer took a subject that could potentially be really boring (cells) and constructed it into something unbelievable. Everyone should read this book.
2,"The high concept behind this novel is certainly appealing, but I didn't like it as much as I hoped. Certain things are very funny--kids in 1994 are trying to figure out what certain terms mean (texting, Netflix, etc) and why people share so much on Facebook. But the characters could be developed a little more. Josh, for example--his decision in the end seems pre-destined by a romantic comedy formula. With Emma, I really liked how she changed her fate after reading about potential miserable marriages in the future. But I thought a bigger morale or lesson was missed entirely--that Emma as an adult gave up on her dreams to follow men who weren't worthy of her. That said, I can easily see this becoming a light hearted movie and perhaps that can even improve the story."
4,"It's free, it's fun, and it's absolutely smoking hot. 
 What are you waiting for?"
4,"Even after all the time that had passed, and even wih the ages-old resentment and dislike I harbored for the darkly handsome young man-who, let's be honest, had only improved with age-there was still something about him that got me. 
 One fateful day made their paths crossed again, (that meeting during Rome's book) and Saint and Nash's life was changed. And their story unfold 
 ""I don't know that you would like me, and the Nash I thought I knew..."" She looked so lost all I wanted to do was give her a hug. ""I hate him, but you... this Nash... all I do is want him"" 
 During their high school, a glimpse of what happened in Saint's eyes was shown. It was during high school when Saint had a big crush with Nash Donovan, he was also one of the reason Saint had no more hope of falling in love with a guy. 
 She had me all turned around and lost. I was trying desperately to figure out what we were doing and where we were going and I wasn't sure there was a map to show us how to get wherever it was she expected me to be at. 
 On Nash's part though, Saint is perfect but there's just something in her eyes that made Nash wonder why Saint seemed to resent him. 
 I don't know what happened to me when I was around Nash, but something about him and me in the same room and I turned into an unpredictable mess. 
 Although Saint hated Nash, she just can't seem to getaway, when she's with Nash, she's very aggressive, clingy and totally different from the shy girl that she is. I was kind of confused if she was really shy, because most of the time she's the one who initiates first. 
 But there was this nagging doubt, these poking questions that jabbed under my skin, that there was still the part of him that could be hateful and cruel, and I just didn't trust it. 
 Most of the time Saint is really frustrating to look at (or read at), she's leading on Nash but when Nash was showing more interest in her she took two steps back. It was really irritating! I go crazy when she does that. 
 I would love her unconditionally if she let me, but in order to do that I had to get her to love herself fully, first 
 Nash on the other hand was such a perfect guy, I just wanted to hug him when he's confused with Saint's actions. Actually at first he's very insistent that he will not be in a committed relationship. But I think between the two of them, he's the first one to fell in love. 
 Marked Men series is slowly getting one of my top favorite, every story was different, they got their own uniqueness. You can differentiate immediately who is what and their characterstic. But one thing that I admire, all of them portrayed a family-oriented story. Everything has a lesson that you will carry when you finished reading it. 
 I like the way Jay Crownover end her book with an anticipating twist of what you will read next. I'm so excited for Rowdy's turn!"
5,Gillian Flynn's mastery of both macro- and micro-writing in this book is phenomenal.
5,"THIS BOOK IS GREAT AND JUST HAS THAT SURTAIN BITE.

5,"While I'm not an SNL fangirl and have never seen 30 Rock, I am on a comedy audiobook kick and though Baby Mama was hilarious. Tina Fey's Bossypants contributes to my goal of reading more memoirs by successful women and finding the audio version was a bonus. Fey's delivery is spot-on, and her accounts of growing up as an ambitious girl are both relatable and entertaining. I find it interesting that my male friends on goodreads collectively rated this book higher than my female friends...Regardless, I'd recommend it to anyone interested in Tina Fey and/or the business of being funny."
4,"4.5 stars. 
 Gayle Forman is AMAZING, even though she left us hanging! I loved so many things about this book BUT I think Allyson's decision to run off with Willem was ridiculous. She didn't want to be adventure-averse, but that's just insanity. It really bothered me that after everything, (view spoiler)[he just left her there. (hide spoiler)] But that leads to what Dee was saying, people shouldn't jump to conclusions & assume the worst in these situations. I was relieved that it wasn't what it seemed. The negative though, Allyson with her ""Bella Swan Syndrome"" drove me nuts. I get it, she was into Willem. But seriously? She confessed strong feelings for him after so little time & she knew that she'd be going home. THEN she acted like she couldn't function without him despite what happened! I just wish that girls wouldn't shut down without a guy, I don't want to read about how someone's entire life revolves around that boy she knew for just one day. BUUUUUT it was still REALLY good & I would read it again, it's beautiful. I need to read Just One Year asap!"
4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 I absolutely adored every chapter. I must admit a lot of it rang of Mission Impossible but it was still great. I loved all the characters and I also loved that the author based Kaz with some of her real life issues. I loved Inej which is actually Jeni backwards. I think the wraith is actually a very appropriate nickname for her, I loved the romance that didn't get to develop between her and Kaz. I have to admit though my favorite couple are Nina and Matthias. They are so impossible apart but at the same time impossible together. I hope they make it together finally in the next installment. I liked Jesper but I wished he didn't have the gambling bit problems. I loved the twist when it came to Jesper I sure did not see that big revelation coming but I understood it. I am so sad for Waylan and his relationship with his father. I got to hate Pekka Rollins he should've gotten his comeuppance but I guess it will happen later... I loved everything. Next please...?"
4,I really liked it! Way more than I thought I would actually. I remember reading or hearing people talking about the Darkling and I didn't understand but now.. I do !
4,"An interesting look into being Iranian during a dramatic time in the country's history. You get a taste of what it was like to live Marjane's life, rather than just witness it from the outside. Because she lived in Iran and the West, she is able to highlight experiences for Western readers that someone who had only lived in Iran during that time might not see as unusual. Indeed, she lives experiences that might not have happened had she not lived in the West briefly, or if she had had a different family. 
 I found the book very similar both in content and enjoyability to the movie. This is not to say that I would not recommend the book - consume both!"
4,"I thought this book was going to be all about Johnny, but the twist in the end made sense after all. Not quite as good as the first two, but it was alright, I was hoping for a stronger finish to the trilogy proper, but there are two other books at least for now, so we'll see where it goes."
5,"This book is so overwhelming! 
 I loved the story so much, because it is involving in so many ways. 
 The characters are awesome in their own way. 
 Sydney is a strong woman, very admirable because she doesn't want to hurt Maggie, even though it hurts her. 
 Ridge, no words"
3,"I was so disappointed. I love Hannah Moskowitz and I was expecting yet another amazing book. Unfortunately, Marco Impossible didn't do it for me."

 He's unhappy because he can't get the chick he wants. He kills himself, leaving the message he did it because of her. How nice of him."
4,I have to admit that I liked the movie version better than the book but I *adore* the character of Tyson in both versions. Can't wait to read the next book in the series!
5,"Dear Rook, 
 From the moment I picked you up, I knew I would like you. Part of that may be because of your author, whose previous works I enjoyed so thoroughly that I am convinced I'll never dislike anything she writes. Ever. So yes, I went into you with a bit of bias, but I did my best to have an open mind regardless. Rook, you were the furthest thing from a disappointment. 
 It's about 700 years in the future. The magnetic poles shifted way back in time, causing technology to malfunction and life as we once knew it to cease to exist. The time of cars, computers, and other electronics has sunken into the past as mysterious, forbidden legends of how people once lived. Paris, now known as the Sunken City, is in the middle of another Revolution. Convinced that technology was the cause of the Ancients' downfall, the Premier of the Sunken City is executing aristocrats who (he claims) are funding laborers to recreate technology and ""steal jobs from honest, hardworking common folk."" And like times of old, they are being put to the guillotine. But the wrongly condemned are not without hope. There's the Red Rook - a mysterious figure who spirits them away from their prison cells before they can be executed. No one knows who the Red Rook is; divine spirit? Ghost? Mortal man? But the premiere wants his head. Only Sophia Bellamy knows the Red Rook's secret: that he is a she - and in fact Sophia herself. But her plans are put in danger with her upcoming nuptials to a Parisian gentleman whose marriage fee might just save her family from ruin. But like Sophia, Rene Hasard is not all he seems, and suddenly she and her family are caught up in a very dangerous game of cat-and-mouse. 
 The world building is incredibly well done. While 700 years in the future, society has regressed to a Georgian-style era. Technology is banned, because it caused the downfall of the old society - the Ancients - and it steals away work opportunities for the peasants (so Premier Allemande and his Minstre of Security LeBlanc claim). But like civilizations in the past that have fallen and there's very little left of them, Sophia's world has turned things like plastic and old CDs into priceless artifacts. They wonder at what they used CDs for, theorize that little action figures might have been idols or representations of what the Ancients wanted to look like. So much information and history was lost in that 700 years. It was really fun and unique to read about ""our society"" from this viewpoint, and it actually was very realistic. While it's hard to imagine, living as we do now, that plastic could ever be a mystery or people would value it, give humans a natural disaster big enough to wipe out records and 700 years to bury the remaining knowledge and maybe it isn't so hard to believe after all. And of course, with the regression of technology and ways of living, Sophia's world still had the historic charm that a retelling (or homage) of The Scarlet Pimpernel needs. 
 In this somewhat strange, yet amazing, landscape we have our main characters: Sophia Bellamy, her brother Tomas Bellamy, Rene Hasard, Tom and Sophia's best friend Spear Hammond, Orla, and Rene's mysterious manservant Benoit. On the other side of the spectrum are the villains: Albert LeBlanc and Premier Allemande. I could go on and on and on about each of these characters, but I will try and be fairly concise. I loved each and every one of them. Sophia is quick-witted, strong, and fiery. She has what it takes to be the Red Rook and save wrongly condemned aristocrats and anyone else LeBlanc wants to execute. Her brother Tom was wonderfully supportive and loving. He wants to protect Sophia, but knows that she has to do what needs to be done, so he doesn't smother her. Orla and Benoit were mostly background characters, but had so much personality. Orla cares for Sophia as if she's her own daughter, but also doesn't smother Sophia. Benoit was quiet and mysterious and there was obviously so much more to him, and I just love characters like that. He knew things and turned up in odd places and clearly held more power than you realize, and he was just awesome. Rene is complicated, and I can't say too much without giving things away. Suffice it to say, he's a bit of a rogue, but it's mostly an act, and when we get to know the real Rene, I fell in love. Spear is also another complicated character; I loved his support of the Bellamy family, and then he started to get his own agenda and I stopped trusting him, and in the end I kind of hated him. LeBlanc is a downright intimidating villain. He is totally and absolutely convinced that the Goddess of Fate is real; that he serves her and can hear her wishes; that Fate has plans for him. He becomes obsessed in his role, in killing anyone and everyone he thinks is standing in his way to bringing the Goddess glory. He's zealous and it's creepy. Allemande just serves himself, is cold and calculating, almost thinks of himself as a god. But these two together and they make for realistic dictators. 
 I even liked your love triangle, Rook. It's safe to say that Sophia's initial dislike of Rene doesn't stay that way after a while. But she struggles with realistic feelings. She's getting to know an entirely different Rene from who she originally met, and she likes this new Rene. But can she trust him? Is this really Rene or just another facade? She wants to trust him, but can she? Meanwhile, her childhood friend Spear has fallen pretty hard for her. And this is where I actually liked the love triangle: Sophia doesn't feel that sort of love for Spear and she never did. He's like a second brother to her, and unlike most protagonists in her situation, once Spear reveals his feelings, Sophia doesn't suddenly start to wonder if maybe she does like him in that way after all. She knows she doesn't. But Spear won't take no for an answer, and he starts acting like there's already an understanding between him and Sophia, and that's when I started to dislike him. He wouldn't listen to Sophia's plans, he went behind her back, he ordered her around, and it just made me like Rene all the more. And that last move Spear pulled. . . .I couldn't forgive him after that. 
 Your plot is half world building, half build-up, half action. I love world building if it's done well, and yours was. I loved the attention to detail Sharon Cameron paid to the real French Revolution and how she incorporated it into this ""history repeating itself"" scenario. Here's an author who took the time to research the Revolution ideals and how destructive they were. So many people glorify the French Revolution; try to claim that the American Revolution copied it (which makes no sense, since the American Revolution happened first. . . .). But the American and the French Revolutions were motivated by two very different things; their ideals were almost complete opposites. And in doing her research, Sharon Cameron presented a very real and very frightening regime. The cat-and-mouse game was so much fun to follow; it got to the point where I really didn't know who I could trust. I followed my gut feeling, but I honestly didn't know for sure. And the ending is so suspenseful and exciting and perilous that any slowness the plot might have suffered (and I didn't think it did) was totally justified. 
 I loved everything about you, Rook. I loved your characters - main ones and side ones; especially all of Rene's uncles and his maman. I loved your world and the detail and history Sharon Cameron utilized and blended in to create a relatively plausible 700-year-later future. I loved your nod to The Scarlet Pimpernel; enough to be obvious, not so much that it can be called a straight-up retelling. I loved your premise, your twists and turns, your writing style, and your conclusion, which is one of the most satisfying ones I've ever read. 
 Feeling completely pleased,

4,"So, as you may know, I'm kind of on a Draven kick right now after finishing Radiance. And let me tell you, she didn't let me down with this one. 
 First off, let me get my nitpicks out of the way so we can focus on the good. The good definitely outweighs the bad. 
 The first 15-25% is very slow, and threw a ton of worldbuilding jargon at the reader. The first chapter had me so damn confused, I felt like I'd been plopped in the middle of the book. Who the hell was Corruption and who the hell was this man talking to it? Was he possessed? WTF. No lead up, just boom, right in the middle. It was jarring. Then Martise came into the picture, and I had a brief, ""Shit, Stockholm Syndrome,"" moment for about 15% of the book. It took way too long for me to get sucked in, but once I did... 
 It was great. The characters are complex and deep, though I would have liked to see more from Martise. I really enjoyed their weird little angsty romance, especially after the angst-free romance from Radiance. The side characters were fantastic, too. Once I had the worldbuilding under control and understood it, I did appreciate how it all came together. It was just a little rough getting there. 
 Draven writes beautifully, and I love how effortlessly the conversation and wit flows. I found myself laughing out loud in some parts, which is refreshing. 
 Overall, I would definitely recommend Draven's work to those who enjoy fantasy and romance. I rated Master of Crows 4/5 on Goodreads."
3,"3.8 Stars 
 This story is a retelling of Thoghtless,only in our lead hero,Kellan Kyle's version. 
 The story is pretty much the same,mainly highlighting Kellan's thoughts and feelings. The reader discovers his past,which is indeed painful. The God-like rockstar had pretty rough times in his life,and is desperate for a connection,and longs for true love. When he meets his best friends' girlfriend,Kiera,who takes a personal interst in his life,he realises that she is the only one he wants to be with forever. And he can never go back. 
 Kellan has undying (and actually infinite)love for Kiera,and will do anything to just share a slice of happiness with her.Meanwhile, Kiera looks more cold-hearted than Thoughtless,enjoying the affection and love of both the boys. (no offence meant,just my thoughts)If this novel were to be written as a thriller,someone would have definitely hurt Kiera. (with the way she was portrayed) 
 Those who have read Thoughtless,will know that the book was uber-angsty.But Thoughtful is uber-uber-angsty.Readers will actually feel the gut-wrenching pain he is feeling. Kellan Kyle lovers will feel to reach out to him (like I felt :))S.C Stephens is undisputedly good in this. 
 A heart-wrenching Thoughtless!!"
4,"This was a pretty standard Dark-Hunter book. That is not a bad thing. The books are usually light-hearted reads filled with plenty of romance, humor, and with just enough drama to keep things interesting. 
 I liked the romance in this one. I was unsure about Wren to begin with, the guy is a bit weird, but enjoyed the way his feelings for Marguerite developed and how they helped bring him out of his shell. I was equally happy with the way Marguerite's feelings for Wren helped to give her the courage to stand up to her father and finally live the life she wanted. The pair made a good couple. 
 The plot was fast paced and fun. Wren is set up by his uncle to take the blame for his parents death and a meeting of the Omegrion is called to vote on his fate. The vote goes badly for Wren and he is forced to try and clear his name. 
 We met a few familiar faces from the previous Dark-Hunter books as they popped up to lend a hand to Wren. That is always fun. Amy and Fang featured as secondary characters and both had good showings. I'm looking forward to reading their book. The other stand out secondary character was the mediator of the Omegrion Savatar. I'm eager to learn more about him in future books! 
 This might not have been one of the very best Dark-Hunter books but it was still a worthwhile and fun read. 
 Rating: 3.5 stars. 
 Audio Note: The Dark-Hunter series has a few audio narrators, but Fred Berman is probably my favorite of the bunch."
2,"Meh. Instalove. Married after only three months. The song's lyric not good enough. Basically just meh, or it's just time for me to read fantasy again after soooo many romances."
3,"This was a sweet little book with bit of magic and superstition thrown in that made it feel like an Alice Hoffman novel set in the world of debutante balls (not that the book has any, but it feels as though the characters must have at some point). 
 The central ""mystery"" in the book wasn't even remotely mysterious, but the characters had a bit of depth and their relationships were (mostly) believable. 
 Completely perfect beach reading."
3,"This book couldn't really figure out what it wanted to be. Would it be a first world problems story about those quirky rich people in Connecticut? A blended family saga? Or a suspense thriller that you didn't see coming? The story took way too long to set up, with lots of extraneous detail in the beginning. Then when it got to the meat of the story, that felt rushed, with the ending being a copout. Most of the people weren't terribly likeable, and ultimately this wasn't a very fulfilling book."
4,"I have been DYING FOR THIS BOOK AND THIS SERIES. I have focused on the release date with laser-like intensity. 
 So, was it worth all the giddy anticipation? 
 (view spoiler)[ 
 :: It doesn't start off as strongly as Blake's beloved Anna Dressed in Blood books; it wasn't as thoroughly compelling. However, by the time that we're realizing there's more to Aiden than meets the eye, you are in for the long haul. 
 :: Athena and Hermes are amazing. Poseidon makes a fantastic monster. I'm hoping Artemis manages to make it to the group safely, because we could use an allied sister to temper Athena. 
 :: Hera as a villain is rather overdone in this genre. Cassandra, honestly, was irritating and kind of whiny, and Henry and Andie needed more build up - I also thing their parents needed a stronger presence. I thought Cassandra just needed to be more human - with aspirations and goals. It doesn't help that the name Cassandra is like nails on a chalkboard to me. 
 :: Odessyus and Athena? Glorious. More. Perfect. Flawless. 
 :: Poor Aphrodite. And Demeter's fate? Ew. 
 :: Overall? Awesome, excellent and I wait on tenterhooks for the next book in the line up, but maybe doesn't quite hit the Anna Dressed in Blood level of oh-em-gee incredible. (hide spoiler)]"

 I have read the series Covenant and Seth intrigued me more than Aiden. So you can understand how happy I was when I learned that Seth had his own book!!I want for him to have a happy ending! But now I feel sad that this book is over...I wanted more..Such an amazing book!! I love the way Jennifer can bring mythology to life! Greek Gods...are something that I already know as I am from Greece so you can imagine my love for this book!! In this book we see what happened to Seth, the deal he did with the gods and the new dangers who threats to destroy what was left. Seth must help the gods to stop the titans who escaped before it's too late. He has to protect someone special. 
 But what will happen when he learns that this special person is a beautiful girl that reminds him of someone else from his past? 
 Seth is kick ass,funny,smart and so hot!!I love his personality!!One thing is certain..If you are with Seth you will never get bored!! This book has alternative POVS so you will be in Seth's mind...What is better than this? Right??? Josie became one of my favorite heroines instantly!I could relate with her!She took the news about what she really is very well and this make me like her even more!Also the fact that she can see who really Seth is, it make hers so sweet.From the first moment you see that these two have a strong chemistry.Moreover the sexual tension between Seth and Josie is just amazing!!! 
 ""I've never had anything that was my own. Nothing that was ever for just me and no one else. I've never been anyone's first. I've never been anyone's only."" 
 ""I wanted what I'd never had.Real companionship.Loyalty.Friendship.Her.Me.No third parties.Just us.A future.A tomorrow.Salvation."" 
 I don't know what I will do now that I have to wait for the next book...I think it could be great if you first read the Covenant series because you can understand Seth better. However Jennifer is such an amazing author and you can see that you still can read this without reading the other series because she helps you understand what's up.I highly recommend it to anyone!!"
0,I AM SO CONFLICTED AHH
4,"I am so confused about who is good and who is evil, and I love it! This series is pretty awesome, and I'm excited for the 3rd book!"
4,"I really like this book, it sucked me in from the beginning and I couldn't put it down. More than once I found myself laughing out loud so I'm really glad I didn't read it in public! 
 The story is narrated in first person POV by the heroine. 
 Chastity is a tomboy and she was always one of the guys. With four brothers and masuline body shape she has some problems in her love life: 
 ""Not attractive! not attract- I'm very attractive!"" 
 [...] ""Sure. A handsome woman. Whatever. And with shoulders like those, you could find work on the dock"" 
 ""I row! [...] I'm strong! That's soppose to be sexy!"" 
 ""Yes, well, proving that you could pick me up didn't exactly se my libido on fire!"" 
 Anyway, Chastity goes back to her hometown, after years in NYC, to be close to her family and to find a husband and start her own. So the story continues with all her adventures (misadventures) among online dating, Single Grocery Night and Lord of the Ring movies. 
 -What I like: 
 It really makes me laugh! I like the heroine, even more because she is a little bit crazy! Plus the plot is fresh and original and I love KH writing style and her sense of humor. 
 -What I don't like: 
 I think the final is a little rushed, we have the HEA in the end, but really, really in the end, like four pages before the bookends. Plus I feel like there isn't really a love story between the heroe and the heroine! During the course of the story they interact only few times and only like friends (view spoiler)[ (except for the cheating part) (hide spoiler)]. 
 Also, with only her POV, we don't know how the heroe really feels about Chastity until the end. 
 I would have liked their love story to be built a little bit slower, for me it was a little out of the blue and I hoped, at least, to find more interaction between the heroe and the heroine in the epilogue! 
 Overall it was a really good book, maybe a little lacking in romance department, but I would recommended it to anyone who wants a fresh and funny read! 
 I apologize if there are mistakes, this is my first review and especially my first review in english!!"
3,"Originally reviewed at Minnesota Reads. 
 Everyone I know has been praising Station Eleven by Emily St. John Mandel, even Game of Thrones author George R. R. Martin declared that it should've won the Hugo Award, so maybe I went into it with too high of expectations, but I don't understand the praise. 
 Station Eleven is basically a post-apocalyptic tale, with most of it taking place after a virus swept the planet killing almost everyone. For those that lived, they left the cities during the virus and congregated in smaller communities around the country, turning places like abandoned gas stations, Walmarts, and airports into their homes. We see different communities in this story as we follow a traveling troupe of actors and musicians who wander from place to place to entertain them. 
 The post-apocalyptic part of the story was very interesting. Early on we see the virus and how it affects some characters and what they do to protect themselves. My favorite part is when we see one man buying everything from a small Toronto grocery store after a doctor friend tipped him off that this is the virus that will take us all out. It was fascinating to see his thought process and everything he buys to try to survive. 
 I also liked the small communities the traveling troupe visit and the different power structures at play, both with the traveling troupe and the communities. In the troupe some people are more important than others, with some referred to by the instrument they play rather than by name. And in some communities religious zealots take over and rule their followers with idiotic decrees. This all seemed believable and I would've loved to have explored more of these interactions between survivors. 
 But we don't get more interactions because of all the unnecessary, boring flashbacks which ruin the momentum of the rest of the story. 
 The reason I hate the flashbacks so much is that they don't seem to make much sense. Multiple survivors have flashbacks about their time, however brief, with an asshole actor who died before the virus wreaked its havoc. This actor cheated on his wives, treated a friend like shit, and was irrelevant to the story about the virus and the lives of the survivors post-virus, yet these are the flashbacks we get? I don't have to like every character, I love a good villain, but this doesn't seem to make sense, especially because often the characters that are thinking about him don't really know him. 
 One of the women in the traveling troupe was in a play with this actor when she was young, though she didn't seem to have much interaction with him, so why as a survivor does she find and collect trashy gossip magazine stories of him? 
 And the man who bought everything from the grocery store at the beginning of the virus was once a paparazzi who took pictures of this actor and his wives, so he only followed them from afar, yet he also thinks about this actor? 
 This story was just framed so weirdly. Why this actor? He didn't play a big part in their lives, before or after the virus, yet that's what they cling to? Sure, some of the flashbacks are from people who knew him more, but even then, what was the point? These flashbacks didn't do much of anything for what these people are dealing with post-virus. I started skimming the sections of the book that were flashbacks about this actor because I didn't care and it had no impact whatsoever on what I was reading. 
 Had this story been just about the survivors of the virus, or had their flashbacks actually meant something to their post-virus lives, then I would've been praising this book, too, but as it is, half of Station Eleven is great, the other half is an unnecessary bore."
5,I really liked this book it had a new twist to the Werewolf and the main loves Shay and Ren were fun and....hot! I would definitely recommend this book to Twilight lovers and well to anyone really it was a fun exciting read!!

 Nocturnal Predators Reviews 
 * I won a copy of this book in a Raffle. 
 I must applaud these authors for making me like a book that's totally out of my genre of choice. I have a pretty strong opinion on dystopian books. The only aspect of it that I actually like would be the future world building. Except that authors tend to make it so out of this world that it becomes unbelievable to a point my brain will just shut down and I feel like ripping up the book. Just because it's fiction doesn't mean it has to be fake and meaning less.I liked the concept of this because it reminded me of Sweet Evil. Not because it's a copy or anything like that. It's because it mentions the 7 Sins, but other then that each book has it's world building, characters, etc. I really loved Lexi and Cole as a couple. She's the stereotypical abused heroine who finds a prince and becomes strong to fight for what right in the end. He's the understanding, respectful, all around american guy stereotype. They complement each other at all angles. It's pretty sweet actually. Lexi did push him around a lot and wasn't as understanding as he was toward her. In the beginning, she had this annoying attitude toward him and a situation with her absentee brother (I thought she was an ungrateful B with an itch at that point in the story).The only character the really got on my nerves would be her brother, Keegan. I would use words like: cold-hearted, rude and un-respectful to describe this piece of man (that is if he even deserves the title of being called a Man). I can't really say much or I'll give a good chunk of the story away and that wouldn't do this book justice. 
 Favorite Quotes: 
 ""What? You didn't realize you have the greatest dog to walk this earth?"" 
 ""The past or the future... What to do when I love both?"" 
 ""Even if it was only for a day, an hour, or a minute - I would risk everything just so I could be with you.""

 Updated Review (With Re-vamped book): 
 My Rating: 4 & A Half Stars 
 * I received an eARC from the authors in exchange of an honest review. 
 I remember when I first started blogging that this was one of the first books I won and felt the need to review. It was awesome and it just got BETTER! I absolutely LOVED the extra scenes and this time around it had a more of a New Adult feel to it, compared to the old version. 
 I still ADORED Cole this time around. He continues to be the understanding, beautiful piece of man candy that he was last time I read about him. I loved how he knew when to push and when to respect Lexi and give her space. 
 ""Any other guard would've beat or raped you by now, and you just keep pushing me when I'm trying to do the right thing."" 
 Lexi was an abused turned strong heroine. She's been dealt a bad hand since her father died and thanks to her mom remarrying, her life turned into hell. Even after surviving being wrongly accused, she still found it in her to be brave, strong and, most importantly, to always fight for what's right. She had my respect from the beginning. 
 ""No matter what I say you won't believe me. When you look at me ... like everyone else, you see nothing but my brand. The commander labeled my a whore, so that must make me one. Right?"" 
 Zeus was as cute and cuddly as ever! I loved how he was described as a total goof ball, but still loyal and VERY smart (which I know seems like an exaggeration, but I have a dog. He's proved how smart he really is. I actually learned NOT to underestimate him.). 
 ""Meet Zeus, my crap-for-brains guard dog."" 
 Keegan was still a domineering, tattooed giant who loved to point out that he was in charge and the Lexi HAD to listen to him. Well I hate to break it to you buddy, but you felt and Lexi grew up. She can very well make her own damn choices and love WHOEVER she wants. Just because you don't like the guy doesn't mean he doesn't treat her with respect and that they both love each other. I think the end he met was Karma. There's a reason everyone calls her a bitch C: 
 I had actually forgotten about the ending. It was so sweet re-reading it. I almost cried because I seriously wasn't expecting it. Everything was going to hell, who knew the authors still had a plot point to exploit? I certainly didn't. 
 Conclusion: I NEED Book #2. 
 ""So we'll take one day at a time, because each day is one day we didn't have before."" 
 My Favorite Quotes (This Time Around): 
 ""My life was a colorful facade."" 
 ""I know what if feels like to be a failure. It haunts you constantly."" 
 ""All I want is to help you heal. To hold you when you cry. To glue you back together when you break apart. I want to reach out and help you back up."""
5,"You know how after reading the first page, you just know that this is going to be a good book?!? This was that book for me! I absolutely loved it from page one and couldn't stop reading it. It really had it all; I laughed, I cried, I smiled until my mouth hurt, I frowned, I got chills. And don't forget the sexual tension - so good!!! 
 We meet Levi and Pixie, two broken souls. Both have suffered the same tragedy, but instead of helping each other through it, they grieve separately in their own way. Yet the underlying current of lust and love is always present. 
 ""I try not to react because, hell, he can't win. He can't just be asshole Levi all day long and then climb into my bed at night and touch me wherever he pleases. Ugh. Yes he can."" 
 Levi is a star quarterback who is currently a handyman at Pixie's Aunt Ellen's inn. He holds a ton of guilt and is just going through the motions. Pixie is a painter and a mess. She is hilarious and snarky and I loved her! 
 ""Good God. I work at Hotel Horny Women. Welcome to Hotel Horny Women, home of scruffy cheese and sensual produce."" 
 The rest of the cast - their friends and the inn employees are fantastic as well, especially Ellen, the aunt, and Jenna, Pixie's best friend. 
 Watching the two of them work through their struggles was simply heartbreaking; going back and forth with their emotions and letting fear control their daily lives. When they finally start living again, it was breathtaking. 
 ""I didn't realize how much I needed this - needed HIM - until right this moment."" 
 I simply cannot say anything more than READ THIS BOOK! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!! (And I'm super excited to find out this is the start of a series)

 I think having read Archer before this one to me it didnt measure up but the Author is a great writer will continue reading this series"
3,"Honestly THIS book is not super amazing, but the series in general is brilliant. Audio book avaliable from borrowbox (free from public libraries) and is read by author and very good :)"
4,"Throughout this series, I have never really loved Lia as a character - she has always seems immature and reckless. I did come around to her slightly in the second book...she was able to control herself and those around her in a very impressive way, she used her words as weapons, and she was never intimidated - I was beginning to see why people described her as fierce and independent. But in this one we backpedaled... 
 For most of the book, (the first half especially), Lia was insufferable - reading less like a fiery independent bad ass, and more like a petulant child. (As a side, my absolute LEAST favorite plot device in YA literature is the know-it-all teenager who is the ONLY ONE who can save the day. It.drives.me.crazy.) 
 I don't know if I can really say I liked this book, but it was a pretty good read. The emotion I felt upon finishing was relief - I had burned through all three books back to back and was SO ready to be done by the end of this. I'm glad to have resolution to the story. (view spoiler)[ I'm also really glad that Kaden and Pauline ended up together (I shipped it) and that Rafe and Lia ended up together. (hide spoiler)] But I am so glad to be done... It was a bit daunting."
2,"WTF? Seriously, wtf? OK, I get it, novels shouldn't be predictable and each is unique, but this one... I mean, what kind of ending was that? The readers were left with no explanation, the last pages were simply just slam, bam, thank you ma'am. Even before that, I wasn't sucked in the story the way I thought I would be. It wasn't all that bad, I finished it, therefore my 2 stars review."
0,So I accidently stayed up til 12:30AM to finish this one. The plot was good! More plot than I'm used to in a romance and I can't say as I mind. Looking forward to the rest of the series.

 First of all it's with great pleasure that I get to review this book! Naughty and I absolutely love this series and we fell hard for Ethan Blackstone. We had David Gandy pictured for Ethan even before we knew that he was Raine's inspiration for the character. Great minds think alike right?! Mr. Blackstone checks all my boxes - alpha male - check, tall dark and gorgeous - check, successful - check, wears gorgeously tailored suits - check, dirty mouth - check, very fit, the kind only found in book boyfriends - check! You get the picture! I have to say that I have read both of Raine Miller's historical romance novels and of course, the Blackstone Affair. I really enjoy her books and I love her characters! My only complaint with this book is that it's too short! I wasn't ready to be done with Brynne and Ethan. Now onto the story. 
 ALL IN picks up right where NAKED leaves off. The difference in this book is it's from Ethan's POV. And what a POV it is! He's sexy, and sweet, and smitten with Brynne. He absolutely adores her and will let nothing happen to her or to them. The letter he writes Brynne after she leaves is so beautiful, swoon!! - but then Brits have a way with words don't they?! We learn all of Brynne's tragic story and why she needs Ethan's protection. We only learn a tiny bit about Ethan's past as a POW in this book. But I have a feeling we have a lot to come in the final installment EYES WIDE OPEN, release date May 14! We meet Ethan's funny, flirty cousin Ivan who will be a great character to read about in upcoming books. Ethan is also security for Ivan. 
 Brynne and Ethan's relationship evolves in this book and they become closer, more a couple. Ethan is terrified of losing her and he does everything to keep her safe. His pressure is mounting as the Olympics in London approaches and threats start to close in on Brynne. The ending is explosive and I can't wait to see where it picks up in the final book of the series. If you want sexy, fun, flirty and just plain hot, read ALL IN!! You will be smiling, trust me! 
 ""And even if you hate me for what I did, I'll still love you. If you won't see me, I'll still love you. I'll still love you because you are mine. Mine, Brynne. In my heart you are, and nobody can take that away from me. Not even you."" - Ethan Blackstone *big sigh*"
3,"When Nathan goes on a mission as a SEAL, and ends up scarred and presumed dead, he has to give up his life including his wife Bella, who grieves deeply for his death. Nathan is then put into black ops and his looks and his very identity is very different from the man he once was. When he is told that his wife Bella is in danger, he is told to go on a mission that may put not only himself but his very heart at risk of being so close to his wife whom has no idea who he is. After losing her husband, Bella still grieves for him deeply. For Bella, he was her very heart and soul, and even though its been years since his death, a part of her believes he still lives on. When a stranger comes into town, insisting on working at her body car shop, she is very reluctant, but as time goes on, there are certain aspects about Noah that draws her to him, aspects that remind her of her husband. But she knows its impossible right? Didn't he died years ago?But will she discover the truth in time before danger comes that she never expects? 
 As far as a good Lora Leigh book, this was definitely well written in her style. However, as I was reading this one, it did have suspense and a mysterious plot, that definitely kept me at the edge of my seat. However the romance in it was to me not the kind of romance I like to read. It seemed like more lust than romance, and yes there should be passion and sensuality in every good romance, but it seemed to be overflowing with it, that I couldn't sense much love between the two, just sex, it just had a more erotic side of things. It definitely is filled with heat that will blister you with captivation. I certainly did devour this one, and I could hardly put it down, but I just felt throughout the whole of it, that there was something missing in their relationship that wasn't portrayed well enough to satisfy this reader. For the most part it was a intense ride and I did enjoy reading it."
3,"Spark pulled me in from the very beginning. From the moment Eric rescues Velaney, I was sucked in and wanted to see how everything turned out. Velaney's past intrigued me, the way the two interacted had me laughing, and the spark between Eric and Velaney was all over the pages. Even when she went on a few dates with someone else, it was still nothing compared to the sizzling romance between the two main characters. However, I liked the story but I didn't love it. 
 Velaney was a hard character to connect with, and I hated some of her decisions and the way her inner dialogue was written. But she did strike me as a strong-willed person who has had a rough life and just wants to be happy. Her vulnerability gave her a personal quality, and her quirkiness was endearing. When her past comes back to haunt her, she must deal with the aftermath of the secrets she's been keeping from Eric. But she's afraid he'll tuck tail and run the first chance he gets. However, she sorely underestimated Eric's love for her, as well as her own self-worth. 
 At times, I was annoyed with both Eric and Velaney, as well as thinking Eric was a creep in the beginning (He was always let himself into hers and Carissa's apartment and cooked them food. Like, that's seriously creepy. Not to mention, an invasion of their privacy). After those initial thoughts, he did make me like him by the end of the novel. Eh, he didn't make me swoon, though (and that's a major negative). I'm sure, since I'll see more of him in Burn, that he'll make me rethink my initial thoughts. However, at the moment, with his weird habits and sometimes really annoying arrogance, he's not at the top of my book boyfriend list. Pretty much the only reason I liked him was because he's a firefighter. 
 The plot was sometimes boring and repetitive, but by about halfway through, the dialogue and interactions between the characters picked up for me. I really enjoyed the book, and I liked how it had elements of mystery and suspense and not just romance. Hers and Eric's relationship was a slow build-up of sexual tension and the underlying friendship they'd started made them seem more personal and real to each other. Also, I loved Carissa, one of the secondary characters, and I want to hear more about her in the second book! I think I may have even liked her more than Velaney. 
 The one thing that made me dislike this book the most, though, was the poor editing. I know, I know. But before you stone me, let me make it clear that I'm a grammar Nazi and an English minor. So, it's incredibly easy for me to spot mistakes. And while I can overlook minor ones, I can't overlook a ton of them. I just wish the book had been edited a little better. 
 If you're looking for a steamy romance, then Spark is for you. With a hot firefighter, a strong heroine, and crazy and intense sparks between the two, this book was an enjoyable read."
4,"Born at Midnight was a supernatural novel that's other novels were bound to be in my collection. With no doubt, I wanted to read the second. Every character, and scene that happened just made me all jittery inside. Now, I was lucky enough to get more of that fantastic-ness. 
 ""When one door closes, find another."" 
 Kylie gazed back up. ""And what if there isn't another door?"" 
 ""Then you try the window."" 
 ""And if there's not a window?"" Kylie asked. 
 ""Then you find a sledgehammer and make a window."" 
 When this began, I was pretty sure that it'd continue with Kylie finding her true self, what supernatural creature she might be. I had many ideas in my head, maybe she's a siren, I don't know. Obviously, this novel had me guessing. 
 The plot began a little slow, I wish that more happened, that's probably why 1 star is gone! But, as we can all see, the average rating is a 4.32, that's super high, higher than what I've ever seen, so we got to give a little credit to the public here. I agree with them, 99%. 
 Kylie has definitely matured and found herself from the first book. She has kind of learned what life may bring, and that everything happens for a reason. I found myself understanding why she never forgave Lucas, at least in the beginning, he really hurt her, leaving her, and how she thought that he loved the she-wolf, what's her name. So, I'm definitely with Derek on this one. Slowly, slowly, she's starting to decide between the whole love-triangle thing. 
 Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It made me laugh, cry, and smile all of the time. I never wanted it to end."
4,"A bleak, depressing, heavily political novel that ought to feature on anyone's list of 'Important Books Everyone Should Read' (though not everyone will want to). I listened to the audio book version ably read by Frank Muller, which probably got me through some of the more boring parts. 
 ""It was quiet in the cell. Rubashov heard only the creaking of his steps on the tiles. Six and a half steps to the door, whence they must come to fetch him,six and a half steps to the window, behind which night was falling. Soon it would be over. But when he asked himself, For what actually are you dying? he found no answer."" 
 The novel is about one of the Old Bolsheviks imprisoned, interrogated, and eventually brought by means of torture to 'confess' to 'crimes' against the Stalinist regime (to shouts of ""Shoot the mad dogs!"") in the Moscow show trials of 1938. Though an indictment against Communism, as perverted by Stalinism, the book has continued, chilling resonance as a testament to state brutality, unjust imprisonment and the use of torture to force confessions (see Guantanamo), the dangers of politics and ideology. A warning from history that is all too contemporary. Stalin's USSR edited photos and books to remove those fallen from favour, fake history, today we have fake news and Google search results favour Holocaust denial."
5,"Originally reviewed at Hooked on Books 
 Seriously. I don't even know where to start. The end of Delirium made me sob. And I mean sob. Pandemonium on the other hand made me walk around like a zombie, book clasped to my chest at 3 in the morning. This book kept me up until all hours of the night and has me checking the days on my calendar until Requiem. 
 My heart actually ached the entire time I was reading this book. It's almost completely focused on Lena, and though I missed Alex like crazy, it was nice to get to know her a little better. She's come so far and been through so much. In Delirium she came out of her shell. She learned to look past the rules and she fell in love. In Pandemonium we get to see her grow as a character. She becomes a lot more brave and a lot more independent. It made her not only someone you could cheer for but someone you could be proud of. 
 Lauren Oliver is an extremely talented writer and she has a special skills for never giving you a straight answer. This book kept me guessing and it was filled with twists, just like Delirium. The expression ""its like the rug has been pulled out from beneath your feet"" is the perfect example of how this book can make you feel. In addition it will also illicit a lot of strong emotional reactions. Both positive and negative. More than a few times, while reading it, the people around me caught me arguing with the book or mumbling to the characters. 
 The one thing that kept me from enjoying it as much as the first book was the non-linear timeline. The chapters alternated from past to present and I would have preferred a similar setup to Delirium, where the story unravels in a more natural fashion. However, this could totally be attributed to my own impatience and my desire to want to know what on earth is happening to all the characters. 
 I think it goes without saying at this point that Lauren Oliver has a way with words. She writes beautifully and is able to break your heart a little more each time. This is without a doubt a sequel that's as good as the first and a series that everyone needs to read."
4,"4.5 stars 
 I so dearly regret reading this several days before my last exam but I had not read in ages and desperately needed something fun and exciting, which this book 100% delivered on, but totally forgot to take into account all the trauma and heartbreak Six of Crows contained (which the book also, unfortunately delivered on). My emotions, and ability to concentrate, were wrecked after reading it. 
 This was probably the most emotionally involving book I've read this year . . . just, holy shit, an unending rollercoaster of feelings. Inej continues to be my favourite character and dear lord do I ship Inej/Kaz to an embarrassingly huge extent. And precious Wylan with his emerging steeliness! Jesper and his adorably kind-hearted dad! (who has clearly wandered into the story from a much nicer genre) Nina and Matthias! This book was five hundred pages long and I should have been studying but I couldn't put the damned thing down! 
 An extremely satisfying conclusion."
3,"""Shall I tell you a story? A new and terrible one? A ghost story? Are you ready? Shall I begin? Once upon a time there were four girls. One was pretty. One was clever. One charming, and one...one was mysterious. But they were all damaged, you see. Something not right about the lot of them. Bad blood. Big dreams."" 
 If we're being completely honest, I thought this was a re-telling of beauty and the beast, so I am a bit let down, but aside from that, the only thing I could find that made it a three-star-rating was the fact that it was repetitive. In some parts, I just wanted to skim and skip through because it felt like ""Okay, okay, yeah, I read that for the last ten pages"". I mean it was all important, but it could have had a bit more drama or something. I did enjoy reading this book, despite what I said above. To me, it sort of had the steampunk sort of vibe to it, which I don't see very often. 
 ""What's most real is that I am Gemma Doyle. I am still here. And for the first time in a long time, I am grateful for that."" 
 Set in the Victorian Era, Gemma Doyle is a teenage girl who has grown up in India. She is obsessed with the idea of living in England, but her mother refuses. After they fight about it for, what must be, the millionth time Gemma goes running through the bazaar. She eventually feels guilt toward the things she said so she goes after her mother. Only to fall and have the strangest dream about her mother committing her suicide because of a shadow. 
 Her family has tried to convince her that her mother died of Cholera, but she knows what really happened. 
 Her brother decides the best thing for her is to go to a girl's school that will teach her how to become a lady. 
 Upon her arrival, enemies, who later turn friends, get in the way and so does a dieary she found in a cave. A diary belonging to a Mary Dowd. 
 One who died in the fire of the East Wing. 
 But what if what she can do puts her in danger? 
 What if Mary Dowd has something to do with it? 
 What if the people she calls friends aren't really there for friendship? 
 ""If I were a man, I'd flatten her. But I'm not a man. I'm here to be a lady. No matter how much I loathe it already."" 
 Along the way we meet Miss, Felicity, Pippa and Ann. Felicity is the fiery one, Pippa is the beautiful one and Ann...she has her singing voice. 
 At first they were split into two groups. Gemma was with Ann, because they were room-mates. And Pippa and Felicity are best friends. But Felicity wants Gemma to get the blessed wine from the church as a form of initiation and their friendship sort of spirals. It is filled with Gemma's secrets into the realms. 
 they made themselves a little club, called The Order, where they meet and read Mary Dowd's Diary, then they all join hands and go into the Realms. 
 Once they're here, they each choose something to become a reality to them there, but when they begin to notice the magic that the Realm's behold the girls want it. They want it all to themselves. 
 But are they willing to do just about anything to get it? 
 What frightens you? What makes the hair in your arms rise, your palms sweat, the breath catch in your chest like a wild thing caged?"" 
 This book had many good aspects. I wish we explored the topics of the Gypsies a bit more, but I hope the next one will be more fast-paced with lots of twists and turns. Much like this one had, but more toward the ending. 
 I recommend this book for anyone who is into Historical Fiction"
3,"Really absorbing, although upon reflection it loses some of its shine. Loved the noir-ish feel of the whole book. It went on a bit too long - I could have done with it ending after the main mystery was solved without continuing to the tidy wrap up. Very clever, which was good while I read it, but if you think too much about the plot it involves many too-convenient encounters / revelations. Still, I'm glad I read it, and would give 3.5 stars if possible (between ""liked it"" and ""really liked it"")"
4,"From the first few pages of the second novel written by author Chevy Stevens, ""Never Knowing"" is full of high-stakes drama and thrilling excitement. Sara Gallagher, a young woman who restores antique furniture for a living, knows that she is adopted. After all these years, she tries to find her birth parents. While doing research on the computer to finally know who her real parents are, she comes across a woman's name that just happens to coincide with the time period and place that she was born. Finally after working up enough courage to introduce herself to her biological mother, Sara tracks her down working in a college as a professor. They finally meet, and it is sure terror for the sought out birth mom, Julia...Sara is a product of a pregnancy that was not consensual between her newly discovered birth mom and the ""Campsite Killer"" that has raped and murdered several people during the last three decades. Julia, so far, has been the only survivor to escape his clutches. Sara, with a fiance' and young daughter of her own, is terrified of being discovered by the killer, and re-treats into hiding...staying home with police protection around the clock. This novel has twists and turns that I never saw coming...just when I thought I had it all figured out, Ms. Stevens spiraled the novel towards a different angle, with me stumped and pondering what the next possible spellbinding diversion could be. The author delivers her climax with a powerful and ensuing chase amongst the cliffs and rivers of British Columbia with deadly results. A novel full of chances taken and having faith in who can trust in the moment of paramount desperation. Don't miss this enthralling and riveting thriller!!"
4,"Some disconcerting violence against animals, and a fantasy element I hadn't expected, but I could not put this book down."
2,"Why I Read This Book: It's the SFDG book for 2015-02-26. 
 A whole lot about Mistborn: The Final Empire rubbed me the wrong way. Some things are the book's fault; some things aren't. 
 1. My expectations. Unfortunately I was expecting the magic system to be interesting and worth analysis, and the writing to be almost as good as Scott Lynch's. Neither turned out to be the case. 
 2. Spoilers. I got bored several times and looked at the Internet to see what other people had said about this book. Unfortunately a lot of people casually dropped spoilers. My problem is that I was expecting a lot of these things to occur in the first book and they didn't. 
 3. Along these lines, there are a whole lot of mysterious things that I was expecting to be addressed that never were. (view spoiler)[What's with the ash? What's with the universal mist that falls every night? There was a hint that perhaps this is a different planet and people from earth came here; what's up with that? (hide spoiler)] 
 4. The style. In this book, Brandon Sanderson uses a style that I find pedestrian. He also has some stylistic tics that tend to knock me out of the story. For example, he often starts a sentence with a conjunction followed immediately by a comma. And, I hate that. 
 5. This is a modern (Fantasy) book with modern pacing. Which means that, to my taste, it's incredibly slow moving and bloated. Unfortunately for Sanderson, the book that I read immediately before this was Bob Shaw's 
 The Peace Machine 
 . In my opinion, Sanderson's book takes somewhere between 50 and 100 pages to hit its stride. The Peace Machine is about 180 pages total. Not only that, it's a revised version of a novel, and it's one chapter shorter than the original version of the novel. As you might expect, The Peace Machine hits the ground running and doesn't stop. Granted, Bob Shaw's plotting tends to be pretty herky jerky, but at least it's entertaining. 
 6. To be fair, I give Sanderson credit for revealing surprises all the way till (almost) the very end. Usually the climax and surprises happen farther from the end of the book, allowing things to cool down. In this case, I wanted to keep reading and find out What Happens Next - but our discussion is supposed to cover only this book. Maybe I'll read more now that I'm no longer constrained. On the other hand, maybe I won't. 
 7. So what about the magic system? It's interesting, but what Sanderson does with iron and steel really, really ticked me off. He emphasizes the fact that iron and steel are pushed (or pulled) directly away from someone. Good! I'm glad he thought about this, and decided to make it specific. (You could ask whether this means center-of-mass to center-of-mass, but that would probably be too nitpicky even for me.) Unfortunately, I've been trained in physics, and Sanderson doesn't seem to concern himself with things being off-center. Characters casually drop coins on the ground, without making sure they're standing directly above the coins; by his rules it seems to me that they should be flying off in diagonal directions. It seems to me that learning how to balance and hold yourself would be critical to using this sort of magic, but Sanderson glosses over these issues, except for two passing mentions of dropping three coins to get tripodal stability. It 
 seems to me that people first learning this magic should need tripods all the time whereas experts could get away with a single point of support - and that's how you tell an expert. 
 8. One other thing about the magic system: It strikes me that, from a Computer Science (or programming) standpoint, you could think of these metals as being like bits that are set or not, meaning that for a small number of metals you could get a huge number of combinations. I think I'd enjoy a book that pursued this angle; it's really not Sanderson's fault that this isn't that book. 
 9. The story revolves around Kelsier and Vin. I didn't like either character. Actually both characters were kind of likable, but the author's approach tends to distance them from the reader (or at 
 least from me). Elend and Dockson seemed more interesting, but perhaps they wouldn't be if Sanderson put his direct attention on them. 
 Overall I'd say I don't see the book as anything special, and Sanderson's style makes me perceive the book as longwinded, with occasional recoil-from-the-page moments. On the plus side, his knack for revealing surprises almost to the very end makes me interested in Finding Out What Happens Next, so I may decide to continue to book two. I wish I could say I look forward to it. 
 (At the SFDG meeting I rated this 7 out of 10. If I converted that numerically to the Goodreads scale, that would 3.5 . But I balk at rating it somewhere between ""liked it"" and ""really liked it"". Going by the text labels, the perfect score on Goodreads would be somewhere between ""it was ok"" and ""liked it"", so I'm giving it 2 stars here and wishing I could give it 2.5.)"

5,"I have never read a graphic novel so heartbreaking in my life! Art Spiegelman did it! The idea of describing the infamous concentration camp in Auschwitz is very well painted in this book. Journey after journey, I have every intention of not continuing this one because it was way too hard, too painful! 
 As a reader, I am already feeling a time lapse, there is this time drag when you can very well feel how every prisoners are going through those sufferings of being treated less than human. Human dignity has been stripped away in just a mere 150 pages, what is there for us to complain when these prisoners are being thrown into such misery for months and years. What right do I have to complain? 
 We are being told in a flashback stories of how Art is transcribing his sessions with his father. The below was the trouble of what Art was facing with information overload and arranging it by sequence and time period. How is he able to visualize what his father is telling him? It's still a mystery that this wonderful graphic novel has been produced. 
 ""There's so much I'll never be able to understand or visualize."" 
 Camps after camps, survivor hood after survivor hood...Violence are not spared, killing spree were ruthless. Death and more deaths. Such memories are never good to be reminded by. I don't blame them of their stubborn nature behavior. This is to compare with what a normal human can only soaked in in this lifetime. Depression is bound to happen and we witness it in this work of art. I can never stop saying how tragic the life is during the Holocaust period. So much fear and sorrows. May God bless their very souls. 
 In the end, the reconciliation was just beautiful drawn and crafted. For such a tragic yet beautiful storytelling by Vladek Spiegelman (illustrated by Art Spiegelman), they both truly are my new found heroes! 
 Ratings: 5 out of 5 stars 
 My Blogspot Review"
5,"Four Words: Oh. My. Clarke. Gable. This book was just so beautiful, with a storyline that was so realistic yet magical and writing style that gave importance to every placed word."
5,Brilliant book. Not normally into horror but was a great introduction to the genre. Terrifying suspense and thrilling page turner. Will read every Stephen King book I can get my hands on.
1,"This book has everything I love, apocalyptic end-of-the-world survival story, stranded somewhere and everyone has to work together or die, is-someone-going-to-rescue-us-or-are-we-going-to-rescue-ourselves mentality, everything I love about a good apocalypse book is here. So why didn't I like it? 
 Characterization. 
 Right from the start, I hated our main character and narrator, Dean. He gave off a Nice Guy vibe and started off by introducing us to everyone on his bus in the grosses ways possible. Did you know his bus driver was ""morbidly obese"" and drinks coffee out of an empty jelly jar? How quirky! He stops mid narration to inform us that there were government cutbacks and shortages so schools had to take all kids on one bus and that's why first graders were on the same bus as eighth graders. He didn't work for me, but I kept going because characters can be flawed. I hoped he would grow and learn. And everything else about this book just sounded so good. He spent half the book complaining about how annoying the kids were (they're children!) and literally saying he wanted to punch a five year old in the face. When another kid almost dies, he says he doesn't feel too bad because the kid kept calling everyone sinners. And we're supposed to root for this guy. 
 Sadly the concept is all this book has going for it. All of the girls are sidelined to show how Great and Manly the boys are. Many times the boys tell the girls to go look after the kids. To go sit back while the boys handle all the hard work. One of the girls did the cooking in the beginning (which made sense, seeing as she was the only one who knew how to operate the ovens), but later that job went to our Main Character, who wasn't even good at it. He frequently burned everything or it was raw in the middle and he was shown up by the eight year olds. One of the girls becomes a caregiver for the kids. She's sixteen and the author treats her as a mother. Our MC even calls her a motherly figure and one person even refers to her as ""Mother Josie"". It wouldn't bother me so much, if that's all she really is in this book. Realistically, she's in shock after the initial incident and is quiet for a good chunk of the book. But immediately after she comes to, she becomes the leader of the kids without any explanation. The kids just flocked to her and no one says why. 
 Our other main female character, Astrid, spends most of her time locked in the ceiling, unless she's being ogled by our MC. Her purpose in this book was to be a Love Interest, and not much else. She causes sexual tension and is there for Dean to spy on her as she's half naked. And finally, Sahalia, a thirteen year old who wants the older kids to stop lumping her in with the little kids, and dresses ""provocatively"" is there to be nearly raped to get the plot moving. Dean spends the whole book talking about how she dresses and how she's asking for it, and it pisses me off so much. She's thirteen! Don't treat a thirteen year old like this! 
 And apparently one of the older kids, Jake, abandons everyone because he wants to find a lost love so he could combat the effects of the chemical spills and have sex again. Okay. I'm just going to pretend this girl isn't fifteen to his eighteen and basically pretend Jake doesn't exist. 
 And THEN (no I'm not done can you believe it) one of the characters, Niko, is a boy scout. He's prepared and knows how to ration and treat minor wounds, and survive in this WalMart knockoff. Him being a scout is repeatedly mentioned to be an embarrassment. He;s treated like he should be ashamed for being a scout and is openly mocked because it's ""gay"". I have a few problems with this. There's the obvious one, using gay as an insult. Then there's the homophobia and transphobia that's present in the boy scout association. Slap all that together and it's a big NO for me. 
 This book was a mess. I can ignore plot holes, and convenient tropes, but the blatant sexism and homophobia (and I think racism, but I'm not 100% sure) I can't pretend they don't exist. The worst part is I'm still interested in what happens in the sequels. I'm going to force myself not to read them because I don't want to give these books or this author anymore recognition. There are better apocalypse books out there, go read those instead."
4,"This is a review I did in conjunction with Jag at thebookhookup.com 
 Our Review: 
 The Story: 
 Ana: This story was a pleasant surprise. I was expecting the same old story of good girl/bad boy but what I got was much more. The story was deeper and the characters more real. It tugged at my heartstrings and also managed to make me smile. I think what made this book different was that this was not just your standard love story. It revolved not only around the emotional discoveries of the main characters but also with what was going on in their lives outside the romance...the not always pretty picture their family and friends were living. Having the characters deal with these difficult situations made them more rounded, more real, and I was emotionally attached by the end of the book. 
 Jag: I've been reading a lot of tattooed bad boy fics lately and no lie, the stories start to get a little formula-like, this was not the case with True. This book, this story, really seemed to go deeper, these weren't your typical nice girl, bad boy combo and that's what kept me intrigued. The story wasn't predictable at all and neither were the characters. I really became invested in Rory and Tyler and enjoyed their up and down love story. 
 The Main Characters: 
 Ana: I really liked Rory. She was a different type of leading lady...a thinker. She was straightforward and spoke her mind. And, even though she was sometimes surprised by the words that left her own mouth, she never regretted them. That is definitely not how most girls are depicted in this type of story. Oh...let's talk about Tyler. *sigh* Tyler was the type of man every woman deserves. Caring and loving and committed and responsible....with just enough bad boy to make you swoon. The way he handled his family, especially his brothers, left me totally enamored! He was realistic, too. He understood his life and his limitations but somehow rose above them to become more. 
 Jag: I loved Rory, I remember at several times in the book I was genuinely surprised by her reactions. In situations where the female lead would normally skulk away in a fit of self-pity, she would burst forth and confront the issue head on. I adored that about her, her reactions, the way she dealt with certain situations just wasn't typical by any means. She had a certain courage about her that sometimes is lacking in these 'good girl' characters. What can I say about Tyler, *sigh* not your typical bad boy. Trying to take a shitty situation and deal with it while trying to plan his future in the best way he can. He's not shooting for the stars, he aiming for just some normal, some stability for his brothers, but not everything ends with a pretty ribbon wrapped around a happy ending. 
 The Romance: 
 Ana: This relationship felt honest. The romance started off on a rocky note and could have easily fallen off the rails due to the twists and turns of the story but the resolution to these situations felt right. In the end it didn't feel forced or rushed, it felt like it played out just as it needed to. I felt like neither one of these characters truly needed the other to make them whole (like you see in so many books) but they needed each other to make them happy. And that felt right to me. 
 Jag: I have to agree with Ana, this relationship did feel honest. There wasn't any love at first sight, in fact, the way they come together could have easily resulted in a quick end. It had time to grow and evolve gradually and let me tell you, there was some serious sizzle too. I am all about the UST and the chemistry and Rory and Tyler definitely have it! 
 Loves and Gripes: 
 Ana: I loved the realness of this story...of how family can impact everything you do and how, sometimes, no matter how hard you try circumstances don't go your way. I also enjoyed the honesty of the relationship between Rory and Tyler and how they seemed to understand each others needs and responsibilities. The emotions in this book were raw at times and it brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion. My only gripe is that if felt the end was a bit rushed. The resolution was too quick...I needed and wanted a couple more chapters of angst. Not sure why I want to be sad longer than the author wanted me to be but I think that would have thrown the book over the top for me...my emotions at the end would have been even stronger if I'd had to work harder for it. 
 Jag: This story was so real, at times it was hard for me but since I am a complete and utter angst addict, I loved it. It felt authentic, I went through a gamut of emotions. My only ONLY gripe is that it ended way too swiftly. I felt like there were a few chapters missing, the chapters that reflected the angst and pain of separation. The campus sightings, the pained eye contact, the yearning looks, the misinterpreted situations...I missed all that. I really believe that the book suffered because the end was just too neat, too tidy, too convenient. It would have ranked a top shelf read had those chapters been there to help process Rory's feelings. I truly believe it would have given the end so much more impact. 
 Recommend? 
 Ana: Yes. It`s a very good read with really likeable characters and lots of emotion. To me, there are still unanswered questions about Rory and Tyler`s future and how some of the circumstances in their lives will affect what happens next. I don`t think there are plans for another book about them but I, for one, would read it if there were!! 
 Jag: I would definitely recommend this book. It's not your typical tatted-pierced bad boy meets college virgin story. These characters have depth and fortitude and they are surrounded by some amazing secondary characters. As Ana, mentions, there are a lot of unanswered questions with Rory and Tyler and if there was a second book, I would definitely want to find out what happens to these characters."
1,"Even though I was very picky, wore only designer clothes, and had a monthly allowance bigger than what most people my age earned in a year, I was by no means a snob. 
 Firstly: this book is a stupid, racist piece of shit. Secondly, it is a grand accomplishment that I could hate a character within pages of meeting her. 
 Right after starting the book, I found out that our main character is rich, adored, and perfect. She gets straight As. She has parental-approved freedom to do whatever she wants. She lives in a fa-bu-lous *snaps finger* Manhattan apartment that never feels like home (;_;) 
 There were definite perks to living in Manhattan, and even more perks to living in a hotel--like maid service, room service at all hours, doormen, valets, access to the hotel pool, the steam room, and the gym. Still, it was hard for me to think of this residence as a home. 
 She has the financial means to do whatever she wants (a fact of which she blissfully and frequently reminds us). She gets straight As. She wears designer clothes (a fact of which she, again, frequently reminds us). She has been accepted to every single university to which she has applied. She has the ability to wander around the Metropolitan Museum of Art at her own will because her parents are wealthy donors. She is bloody fucking perfect. Whoop-dee-fucking-doo. 
 Meeting the most perfectest Mary Sue in the whole fucking world. This is surely a fantastic start to any story. 
 So there's beautiful, wealthy, perfect-in-every-way Lily. She spends her afternoons just chilling in off-limits (to regular middle-class folks) areas of the Met. While chilling in a closed-off Egyptian exhibition, she hears a weird noise and then a weird guy emerges from the shadows, and surprise, surprise. He's an Ancient Egyptian. He's gorgeous! HE SPEAKS ENGLISH!!!!!!!! He has green eyes, because that's so fucking common in Egypt. 
 Who are you? I wondered as I studied the person, who was not a man and yet not a teen. He seemed...timeless. Hooded hazel eyes, at that moment more green than brown, beneath a strong brow pinned me with a gaze that was both intelligent and almost predatory. I felt like a mouse looking up at a swooping falcon, knowing death loomed but utterly unable to look away from the beauty of it. 
 And he's looking for...jars! And without the jars, he needs...her! Oh my god, she is the only one EVAR WHO CAN GIVE HIM WHAT HE NEEDS!!!!!! *cough*Mary Sue*cough* 
 ""You do not understand. Without my jars I must share your life force."" 
 Panicked, I spun and ran toward the curtain. But before I reached it, the lights went out and I banged my knee against the golden sarcophagus. Stumbling to catch my balance, I heard him coming toward me. ""Come back, Young Lily,"" he groaned. ""I need you."" 
 He needs her. He pursues her. He all but kidnaps her. Wait, he does kidnap her. But he's so....different, and Lily finds herself oddly attracted to him. 
 I didn't go for dangerous guys, especially bald guys wearing skirts who I couldn't figure out. He was different from any guy I had ever met. 
 This is called a no shit, Sherlock moment. He follows her. He stalks her. 
 Gripping the balustrade, I closed my eyes, basking in the feeling and momentarily forgetting my surroundings until I heard an all-too-familiar voice. ""The sun makes us feel strong, Young Lily. As I am bound to it, you are bound to me."" 
 Though it was definitely strange and all kinds of wrong to find him not only in the building I lived in but also on the same floor and just outside my room, I was surprised that I felt happy to see him, crazy stalker or not. 
 Surely Amon is the model of a perfect YA love interest. 
 Do I need to go on? 
 This book is culturally insensitive. It has The Last Samurai syndrome in which a white person swoops in and saves a culture about which they know nothing. It doesn't display anything true about the culture (in this case, Egypt) that it purportedly portrays. The ""Egyptian"" characters are exoticized and more or less whitewashed to a Caucasian ideal of what a foreigner should be. The characters gorge themselves on American food. Egypt is restricted to an ""exotic"" ideal, without a single mention of the current, dangerous, and politically unstable condition that the country is currently experiencing. It is the story of a rich white girl who, more or less, plays tourist in a foreign country and sees nothing of that country beyond the boundaries of her 5-star hotel room. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money."
3,"I definitely give this one points for being different than most of the young-adult fare currently being published. Judith, our protagonist, is mute after escaping from some mysterious fate in the Puritan times, with half of her tongue cut off. Will she find her voice again, and exonerate herself and her childhood friend from false accusations? Not exactly a page-turner (at least for me), but it did keep my interest until the end."
0,"I enjoy this series so much. I love the world more than ever, and am even more invested in the characters and their relationships, especially now they've all become complicated and further developed. I feel such empathy for Holland; he's stubborn but dignified and ultimately (I think, anyhow) a good person. One thing I appreciated in particular was how a couple of the side characters became fully-formed in book two, namely Ned and Hastra. Now I have to wait over a year for book three. *sigh*"
5,"One of the reasons short fiction is my favorite genre is the requisite economy of words an author must employ. A virtuoso can make you feel all of the unsaid things; fleeting djinns seen with peripheral vision that may/not be there. My solid measuring stick of fantastic writing is reaching the end of a story and getting that unsettled just what the fuck is going on here feeling - a sensation that can come from something genre-stretching from Ben Marcus as much as a writer penning a piece in a classical style. Ron Rash is one of the latter and one of the most talented writers in the genre today. 
 Rash's southern roots show in all of the pieces in this collection - and that's a good thing. Those djinns aren't hidden from him - he can write a heartbreaking piece set in the shadow of the Civil War as well as a modern day love story centered around meth. He could teach a doctorate course on how to write dialogue. And then there are those passages that catch the reader unaware. The eyes mist, the throat lumps: 
 Maybe it's because the picture's a little blurry, but one second I see something in Kerrie's face that reminds me of when she was a baby, then something else reminds me of her in first grade and after that high school. It's like the slightest flicker or shift makes ones show more than the other. But that's not it, I realize. All those different faces are inside me, not on the screen, and I can't help thinking that if I remember every one, enough of Kerrie's alive inside me to keep safe the part that isn't. 
 That's from the story ""Twenty-Six Days"" in this collection; a mother's thoughts after a Skype video chat with a daughter deployed in Iraq. Any reader that comes across this paragraph that has ever held these fragmented images of a child far away, rarely seen, can understand exactly what Rash is talking about (regardless of the situation surrounding that part of us that is growing older). This is what we talk about when we talk about love. 
 Rash is about to become so very much more famous when the movie Serena is released later this year, and he deserves all of the attention he will get from penning a great novel that became that movie. But it is the short stories that have me in his orbit. I entreat you to sample his work. You won't be disappointed."
0,"I've seen a lot of bad reviews on this one; I'm scared to read it! I wasn't a fan of Dani during the first 5 books, so I just can't see myself liking this. On one hand, I want more Mac and Barrons and Burned, I hear, is more from Mac's POV. I wish I could just skip this one. On the other hand, I am scared reading more of the series will ruin how the fifth book ended. I was happy with it. I love Barrons and Mac; I don't want that to change. I'm scared if I continue the series, Mac will start to annoy me and Dani will make me pull my hair out. I like my locks too much to put myself through it, thank you."
5,"OH MY GODSSSSS! 
 This book was such a revolution and I don't know what to think of it. 
 Their bond is only emotional. A raw emotional feeling. 
 Kitty has everyone torn away from her and I could only feel sympathy for her. I couldn't feel the raw emotions that she was probably feeling at that moment."
5,"This book is a bit of an odd beast in that it starts out VERY VERY kinky. As in rough stranger sex with lots of ass play, talk of fisting etc. And through the first maybe 40% of this story, the sex is hard core like that (even a 'pony play' scene, which I have never read in a book ever before in my life). But then the story becomes very relationship-y and sweet and more like a traditional romance. I'm not sure the transition 100% worked for me in that it felt a little like the author did a 45 degree turn at some point and one story became a different story, from hard core kinky to a very sweet, family-oriented, fade-to-black-at-the-sex-bits one. 
 That being said, I adored Heidi's writing and I really enjoyed reading the entire book, though the relationship stuff, the last 60%, was by far my favorite. So yummy and good was that part, indeed, that I wholeheartedly give this book a 5. Am I out of Heidi Cullinan books to read now? Write faster, please! ;-)"
2,"The concept of Night Watch is brilliant, and that's the one thing that kept me reading it. 
 In my opinion, the book has a major flaw: The characters are very sketchy and indistinct. The narrative specified a few lines about the appearance of each one, but that's about it. Most of the characters were essentially flat characters - they didn't become believably animated in my imagination because they suffered from a lack of personality. 
 Now that I think back on it, I think that the best character studies in the whole book were the three prologues that appear at the beginning of each third of the book. The actual members of the Watch ... they were always shadowy and vague. Even the protagonist isn't well-rounded - we learn all about his stress and existential drama, but we know next to nothing about the little details that make characters really live in the imagination. He's defined purely by his angst and the fact that he doesn't think he should be a field agent. Well, I guess that's angst too. He's just a ball of angst. 
 The plot set up great scenes and showdowns, but actually reading them ... blah. It wasn't the emotionally gripping experience that I expected."
5,Hilarious and UTTERLY DISTURBING!!!!!!
5,"This is a story about Elaine, a young woman living in the time of Arthur and Camelot. She lives in a battle camp and is the only woman there. She takes care of the men, including her father, brother, soon-to-be-king Arthur and Lancelot. One day the men make a plan to attack the opposing army and Elaine decides to follow them, makeing more problems and solving some. 
 I really love this book. It is written in a poetic style so it is a fast read. The real 'action' plot happens over only a few days, but I get really engaged in Elaine's way of thinking and what she does to furthur her plan. Lisa Ann Sandell created a very believable character who knows what she wants and works to make it happen; I like that. I have actually found myself wishing that this book was a couple hundred pages longer just so that I could stay in Elaine's head and life a bit longer."
5,"I can't express how much I love this book! 
 Simone Elkeles is a brilliant author. This book was smart, funny, sexy, heartbreaking, it was the perfect love story. 
 I devoured every page in this book as there was never a dull moment. Like Perfect Chemistry it had dual narration which helped you really feel what both Kiara and Carlos are feeling. I love Carlos he was an amazing character and the things he said always put a smile on my face. I adore Kiara she was such a strong character despite Carlos' ego and attitude. They had great chemistry! The secondary characters were good as well, Tuck definitely made me laugh and it was great to see more of Alex and Brittany. 
 Overall, this is a book you don't want to miss! 
 Now I just have to wait until early 2011 for the next one to come out!"
4,"What a cliffhanger! Dang.. But this book was so great! I know I'm a little late on this bangwagon, but that only means that I don't have to wait as long for the sequel. HAHA! 
 I really loved all the characters and the atmosphere that was created. For the first 100 pages or so I was having real difficulties with names, ahah. They all looked similar to me and I'm still not sure how to properly pronounce them.. Especially Shahrzad. I might find out someday, but I won't worry about it. lol 
 The magic system was introduced in tiny little bouts throughout the story and more so at the end of the book, with very little explanation on how it actually works. I am very excited to learn more about it in the next book. I really hope it focuses on that aspect more than it did in this one."
3,"So, I liked it. The main problem I felt it suffered from was that it was more of a political treatise than a novel, about how being militantly anti-religion is just as crappy as being militantly religious. I suppose. 
 There's not really a LOT of conflict - there is some - and the novel all wraps up far too neatly, I feel. Mostly there are lots of spiritual stories. But I don't know, it intrigued me. I feel like with a rewrite, and some more conflict (for instance, (view spoiler)[the novel is set in a totalitarian state with menacing secret police (well they weren't very secret I guess, but certainly menacing), and maybe they could actually have done something to justify that reputation! (hide spoiler)]), this could have been better."
4,"This is apparently a young adult novel, but it really didn't feel that way to me. It felt more like an adult novel that happened to have teenagers as the main characters. 
 As far as Clary knows, she's just a normal teenage girl living in New York. Her father died in a car accident before she was born, her mother is an artist, Luke is a close family friend, and Simon is her best friend. All that changes the night she goes to a club with Simon and sees three teens kill another teen they claim is a demon. When Simon returns with a bouncer it becomes clear that she's the only person who can see any of the teens. 
 Not long after that Clary's mom abruptly announces they're going away for the summer. Angry, Clary storms out and goes with Simon to listen to his friend's band play. She ignores her mother's repeated calls and when she finally does answer, she realizes something is very wrong. Her mother sounds panicked and all but screams at her not to come home. 
 Fearing her mother is in danger, she immediately returns home to find her mother missing, their apartment ransacked, and a demon inside. In order to find her mother she has to enter the realm of the shadowhunters. 
 The shadowhunters are raised to kill demons and downworlders who attack humans. Downworlders are part human and part demon (werewolves, vampires, etc). They use magic by carving runes into their skin with a stele, runes that leave a faint scar. 
 Gradually Clary learns that almost nothing is what it seems or what she thought it was. 
 I liked all of the main characters, although Simon occasionally got on my nerves. I normally like the shy, geeky type, but the vast majority of the time he was pretty passive. That's not to say he was entirely useless, he often thought things through in a way no one else did and it certainly saved their lives more than once. But he didn't have a forceful personality at all and the other four characters had strong personalities. 
 I really liked Alec and I liked that Clare included a gay character. I'm not sure I totally get why it was so looked down upon by other shadowhunters though. They didn't have the mortal cup to make more shadowhunters anyway so breeding shouldn't be an issue. 
 Isabelle was the requisite mean girl, but it was obvious she cares very much for her brother. 
 I liked Jace, too, even if his badass/broody male thing became very juvenile at times, especially when he was fighting with Clary. But he also had a few moments of humanity which made him seem like more than just a one dimensional character. He could even be sweet, at times. I really liked his chemistry with Clary. 
 I like the world Clare's created, and all the intrigue that goes with it. I guessed the big reveal before the end, but only a chapter or so beforehand. I'm really curios to see how it will affect everything in the next book."
3,"Again, with this author, I devoured the beginning, and at some point (in this case, on page 243) the story shifted and I was not thrilled with the direction it took. The beginning was deliciously atmospheric and creepy."
1,"Yeah, this was just a book about a family who had some serious issues and problems with being honest. And their gay friends who really weren't an important part of the story"
4,"Alice and Julia give me life. Guys, I think Grossman really outdid himself here. This book was so good."
0,"Since i don't live in UK..........When i heard about the book

3,Three and a half stars.
2,"I know that me calling this book ""dull-ass"" was a little harsh but, in my opinion, it deserves the title. I mean, for a novel with such a catchy two-line synopsis (look to the cover), you want action and excitement. Did we get that? Hell, no. 
 The protagonist, John Smith (I hate that name for some reason), is an alien. He is, in fact, a special kind of alien called Garde who develop powers called Legacies. But only nine of them escaped the planet's destruction, to earth. And now they're being hunted by Mogadorians, the alien race that invaded their planet. The nine can only be killed in order. The first three are dead, and John is Number Four. 
 And his personality is even more cardboard that the Four from the Divergent, the movie one. Yup, it's that bad. And most of it is due to the writing. 
 Basically, the writing sucks. The dialogues are poorly written. There is no intrigue or urgency to it. There's a shit load of telling and absolutely zero showing. Some scenes are semi-decent, while others feel like they've been written by a fifth grader. It's dull and has about as much emotion as a rubber duck. The only thing that kept me going was that it was boring and not incomprehensible, though the actions scenes came pretty damn close. 
 On the bright side, I liked the story about the aliens. I liked finding out more about the Lorien planet and what happened to it. The powers were cool. Everything 'alien' was good. It's actually the reason I'm planning to continue reading the series. 
 Another thing that wasn't good: the romance. I feel like I've been complaining about romances a lot, but is it really my fault that so many authors do a shoddy job of it? And this one was particularly bad because there wasn't any. Seriously, there was not one moment of romance or chemistry between John and Sarah. Their meet-cute was anything but cute. She's a gorgeous ex-cheerleader with a jackass of an ex, who John liked because she's gorgeous and who liked John because... he's the protagonist? 
 The authors (Pittacus Lore is a collective name for two authors) didn't give two shits about actually building a romance. They just threw it in there because it seems to be a requirement in YA fiction. And mostly, I don't mind the romances, like them even, but not his time. I mean, they didn't even put any effort into it. 
 And what made it worse was that it had zero relevance to the plot. Hell, Sarah, who didn't even get a personality, didn't have any relevance. You could've removed her entirely and things would have gone on without a hitch. Hands down one of the crappiest romances I've ever read, since the authors didn't even seem to care about it. They actually didn't seem to care about anything, if you take into account the amount of cliche, or convenient, parts. I feel like this was just an easy money-maker. 
 Overall... I've got nothing else to say. I'll read the sequel (maybe in a couple of month, maybe later). As for this book, read it if you feel like it."
0,"My very first DNF of Lyndsay Sands. Sigh. The relationship between the two starts off as casual sex. Where's the romance in that? I liked the heroine, she seemed calm and competent. He is a rake first class. I got half-way through and just couldn't stomach it any longer. Switched to one of my tried and true Lynsay Sands: ""Devil of the Highlands""."
4,"Really enjoyed this book! My friend got me into it, as she is currently reading the series like crazy. I think she read one and a half in two days, which is insane so I wanted to give it a go. 
 Definitely the perfect read for bingeing. It's about a girl named Becca who gets stuck in the middle of a clash of swords between the Elemental Merrick brothers, who wield elemental magic, and the Guides, who are the people to bring down the most dangerous ones... Which I believe are the Fifths? Kind of confused there. 
 I did enjoy the story and it kept me wholly entertained. Some parts were a bit scattered and not completely explained but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Loved Nick and Gabriel, the latter is going to be the main perspective for book two!! I can't wait to read it."
5,"I had forgotten how much of a thrill ride Harry's mixture of humor, bravado, self-doubt, and determination could be. These 400+ pages are packed with action, new players, and shifting roles for the original cast, all told from a viewpoint of a man who is far too familiar with his own weaknesses and all too conscious of what he believes are the weaknesses of those he loves and/or fears. Upon finishing, I immediately searched for proof that the series was going to continue."
4,"Ms. Kurtagich is quickly becoming a must-read author. Her writing is very atmospheric, which is essential for the horror/psychological thriller genre. I don't want to say much about the plot but there is a culmination and I didn't see it coming. I can't wait to see what this author does next."
5,"I'm not a big reader of graphic novels, but a friend recommended it for its intensely detailed artwork, and poetic take on what it means to grow up, find love, lose religious fundamentalism, and figure out what exactly you want out of life. 
 Thompson's story is simple, sweet, and covers a wide span of years and heavy topics without being overwhelming or bogged down in the details."
4,"Hmm, what did I like about this book? Everything. It captured my attention from the beginning and it didn't let go until the very end. 
 My one problem with this book, was how everyone always kept saying ""You betcha"" that got on my nerves sometimes. But the characters made up for that, because I loved reading about them! Each character was so different than the other and that made it so much more enjoyable to read."
4,"""As I hurried down the path toward home, I felt, for the first time, like I was walking toward something. Toward my future. Toward Zehava."" 
 Starglass follows what's left of humanity on a ship headed to a potential life supporting planet called Zehava. Life on the ship is carefully regulated with strict rules in place to insure the survival of the human race. The main character, Terra, at sixteen has just reached the age of maturity on the ship and has been assigned a job she doesn't like and is expected to find the person she intends to marry, but when she inadvertently witnesses a murder that was covered up she's quickly swept into a world of secrets, rebellions, and a fight for power. 
 Whenever I find a sci/fi book about the humane race in a ship heading towards a new planet I always read it because I absolutely love that kind of story. These kinds of stories are always filled with themes of power, authority, etc. and Starglass is no exception. 
 Terra, as a main character, is an interesting character simply because of her age and knowledge. When she's thrust into this secret world within the ship she's lived in her whole life she doesn't have a full grasp on the implications of joining this group. She's naive and blindly follows. As a reader I was immediately skeptical of all the information that was fed to her, so I was much more hesitant than Terra. Usually I would get annoyed with the main character for being naive, but having this different view from Terra enhanced my reading experience. 
 The reason I didn't give this book a 5 out of 5 stars is because the world building is shaky at times. It isn't entirely clear why the ship was needed in the first place. The history of the ship is incredibly interesting, however the reader only gets snippets of its past. The snippets are grounding and give enough information to understand, but I wish there was a little bit more. The rules that are set in place are interesting and I could assume why they're needed, however I wish there was a little bit more information on their formation or why they were needed. 
 Overall, Starglass is an exciting sci/fi read. It does stumble at times, but eventually finds its pace and will leave you desperately grabbing for the sequel."
2,"Maybe because I've been reading so much YA, but this just feels so moralistic. It's teaching an important lesson in a totally unsubtle way."
5,"Wow. I read this in two or three sittings. It's short, straight-to-the-point, and well-written. While it's nothing I found to be particularly new in terms of execution or story, it was still really entertaining. There's no mystery to it, aside from the fact that nobody knows who the werewolf is. One thing I really liked was how the story paced itself with the werewolf scenes--once a month. It was almost like a twelve-part comic miniseries adaptation, with each issue being a month. 
 The pictures helped. LOL. Bernie Wrightson's artwork is amazing and really helped set the mood of the book. Just by skipping through its pages to see the illustrations, you know what you're in for. The illustrations may be creepier than the actual story. Personally, I can't decide if I like the black-and-white illustrations better than the colour illustrations, or vice versa. 
 Everything about this book feels right. There's no filler to hold it down. It rips through the narrative with some poetic wording here and quick-but-brutal carnage there. 
 I recommend it. It's a nice little yarn."
5,Probably the best anthology I've read yet.
4,"Flick lives in the streets, he's running from his past and supports himself by being a thief. One day a strange man makes a proposition to him that ends up with a invitation for a prestigious school, only that school is not at all what it seems. 
 With course descriptions like 'Human Trafficking in the Internet Age' and 'Secrets and Sabotage', The Mandel Academy has been graduating criminals for generations, and as Flick is about to find out graduating is hard especially with psycho Directors with their own agenda and students willing to do whatever it takes to be number one."
4,"it's totally official! I love this series. It's a little bit like another series by the same author, but I truly like the mythology a lot better here. The fluff is really fluffy, but there are times when fluff is just what I need ;)"
4,Probably closer to 3.5. I'll definitely be reading more Jemisin.
4,The ending really did break my heart. Loved Legend. Liked Prodigy. Can't WAIT for Champion!
5,"I am usually not into reading zombie books, but this was so good, I couldn't put it down. Joe Ledger was the typical smart-mouthed hero who takes no prisoners and you can't help but like him. Similar to Jack Reacher I suppose. 
 This book was very different from the norm, it was not your typical zombie book, so maybe that's why I couldn't stop reading until I finished it. Tons of action, and everything in the book happened within a day or two at max. In the morning Joe is still a cop, while in the afternoon he's on his first mission to kill zombies. 
 Recently I read Khost, another great book with special ops fighting zombies, and I thought I would never find a book as great as that one in a similar theme. I was wrong. This is just as good as Khost, maybe even better."
4,"(Originally posted on my blog, Misprinted Pages.) 
 I'm already well into reading Mockingjay, but I wanted to stop and discuss Catching Fire (spoilers!), the middle novel of The Hunger Games, which came to movie theaters this winter. 
 (view spoiler)[I always expect second books in trilogies to be the weakest. In Catching Fire, author Suzanne Collins turns the story in a predictable direction: a budding rebellion against the Capitol. The plot lacks as much substance as the first book, but Collins manages to surprise me by throwing main character Katniss Everdeen back in the Hunger Games with a bunch of old people and young, lethal victors from the past annual ""celebrations."" 
 Katniss will always have a place in the Games now, but I didn't expect to see her back in costume so soon. It's a good twist, but not everyone will approve: The Games segment of the book is short and too similar to events we've already seen, and the first half to two-thirds are plodding. (hide spoiler)] The romance, fake or otherwise, between Katniss and Peeta -- the boy with the bread and her star-crossed ""lover"" -- and Katniss and Gale -- her childhood friend and fellow hunter -- is more prominent in this novel (that's good or bad, depending on what you were hoping for) although Collins thankfully grounds it in the grim reality of their situation. In the Games or in District 12, every move Katniss makes still puts her life and the lives of others in jeopardy. 
 So Catching Fire is lighter on content than the first book. There are some beautiful or dramatic moments involving a (view spoiler)[wedding gown (hide spoiler)], Katniss's lead stylist (Cinna), and her competitors -- and supposed allies -- in the Games. I found the story absorbing though maybe that was because the romance was so juicy, but I also liked Katniss's opponents more this time around. They're a lot more striking: Johanna, who strips and trains naked (the actress for her in the movie, Jena Malone, is perfect); Finnick, charming and arrogant and deadly in the water and on land, who becomes one of my favorite new characters; and the intelligent and weird ""Nuts"" and ""Volts,"" to name a few. I also liked all the environmental traps in the arena even if they felt contrived (view spoiler)[(monkeys, blood rain, etc.) (hide spoiler)], like Collins was just dropping obstacles in there to pad out the Games (not that the wall of fire from book one was ever particularly clever or original). The characters' interactions are what make the battle royale interesting, not anything the Gamemakers throw at them -- although I did think the jungle and clock theme were fun. 
 I spent a good amount of time during my read-through thinking about Peeta and Gale and whom, if either, Katniss is better off with. I don't think it's fair that she should be forced into a romance when marriage and kids and love are the last things on her mind. But for her, these relationships are still happening -- unwillingly and as much out of necessity as natural desire. Her survival in the Games depends on how well she and Peeta can put on a ""show"" for the audience, but they're also thrust together privately through their mutual situation. (view spoiler)[They comfort each other when they're tormented by nightmares; (hide spoiler)] their trust in each other is strong because of the Games -- and that bond, formed through the preservation of their own mortality, is much more intense than that between her and Gale. Those two only tasted a small measure of danger in the woods outside District 12. Their reading of each other's body language is much more intimate as hunters, and perhaps their world view is more similar, but Katniss never expressed a love for Gale whereas with Peeta, she feels gratitude and admiration -- for the eloquence of his words, for his optimism. For saving her life time and again. For understanding what it's like to survive the Games because he was there with her. 
 I don't know how the trilogy will end, but I'm hoping Katniss gets to be with Peeta. (view spoiler)[What started as distrust and confusion and a sickly sweet performance has morphed into genuine affection, friendship, and more. They sleep soundly next to one another. She notices his hands as they work on a painting or drawing, like a lover would. (hide spoiler)] And that's all because of the nightmare they went through in their first Hunger Games. Sometimes, life is funny that way."
2,"I am so ""meh"" about this series. I remember enjoying the first one, where a group of teenagers escape from a deadly maze, but this was my second time attempting this one, and I think if I hadn't done it on audio while cleaning the house, I would have ended up putting it down again. 
 Technically all sorts of exciting stuff happens, but somehow the way the action unfolds is boring, or just too incomprehensible. The W.I.C.K.E.D. Corporation seems to thrive on puzzles that make no sense and satisfying resolutions to perplexing problems are nonexistent, which makes the whole thing seem like a chore to the reader. 
 A small part of me wants to read the rest to see if this mess resolves into something comprehensible, but mostly this just felt like a waste of my time."
0,"This review originally posted at More Than Just Magic 
 Earth Girl is an exciting new science fiction novel, with a foot in both the young adult and adult fiction worlds. I would hesitate to classify it as either one and because of that I think it will appeal to a wide range of fans once it hits shelves. 
 In particular, readers are going to fall in love with the setting of this novel. The idea that Earth is no longer our primary location in 2788 was fascinating to me. Janet Edwards develops a really creative new system for our society to grow within and I liked learning about the different planets and what each one was known for. That being said, I was happy that the majority of the novel took place on Earth. Though it is interesting to see what would happen once we spread out across the galaxy, the history buff in me is fascinated with what would happen to the Earth after we leave it behind. 
 This focus on history continued throughout. This was nice to see in a science-fiction novel - which are usually so focused on the future. Because Jarra is a history student the reader gets a slow and steady exposure to what has happened between the present day and the year 2788. We got to look back over the years and learn what we did wrong. This interesting perspective of looking back on things that haven't happened yet, might be just the thing needed to keep us from making some horrible mistakes in the future. 
 In addition to the history, Earth Girl's complex and unique plot was able to explore some interesting questions. Such as the effect labels can have on a person and the importance of self identity. Jarra becomes an interesting character study over the course of this novel and I was fascinated with watching her change, devolve and evolve as the story progressed. 
 Unfortunately, this character study was both a positive and a negative. Though this made her an interesting case to look at, it also made her hard to relate to as a person. I never felt a very strong connection with Jarra and because she was so central to the plot, I also never felt a strong connection to the novel. 
 I also had some problems with the science behind this story. I'm willing to suspend a certain amount of disbelief with science fiction novels. It's one of the requirements of the genre. But Earth Girl pushed the boundaries of this suspension to the limit. Some things were just too far fetched, or just didn't make scientific sense. I think some better science could have greatly improved the believability of this novel. 
 Earth Girl is an exciting novel with some unique and interesting ideas worth exploring. However, the character development wasn't as thorough as I would have liked and I often found it difficult to believe the explanations for what was happening. It's not a bad read, but it wasn't one I particularly loved either. 
 Final recommendation: May appeal to science fiction and dystopian fans, but not recommended for those who enjoy the more ""heady""/innovative versions of the genres."
4,"With so many deaths by Adelina's hand, deaths that haunt her, I guess there could not have been any other ending. Despite the love relationship and her sacrifice, I still couldn't get engaged with Adelina, notwithstanding the dark thoughts still pervading her mind and her paranoia that leaned toward her bipolar personality. Constantly her thoughts would drift toward harm onto others. Which, obviously, makes her not so likable. And alienated me, the reader. 
 The bitter sweet ending tied up the series wonderfully and suits the title.

2,"It's possible I may retry this at some point, as many goodreaders seem to have really enjoyed it. But for now, it's just not doing it for me. 
 The whole concept feels derivative to me. Maybe I've read too many books like this, or maybe it's my bad associations with reading a similar book, shh bvrkht mbshvrh (a.k.a. To the End of the Land) -- a book with basically the same concept that went on FOREVER. 
 It's challenging to write a believable book about a supposedly rational, commonplace character who suddenly develops a fit of magical thinking and decides they can keep a dying person alive by taking a long walk with no map or supplies. It's challenging to make the reader empathize with that character and suspend disbelief in support of his ill-conceived goal. It's challenging not to resort to cliches and emotional manipulation such as having every person the hiker meets offer some kind of profound insight in the guise of everyday conversation (so inspiring!). These are challenges which Rachel Joyce failed to meet. 
 One goodreads friend states that it's worth it to hold out for the end of this book, and perhaps she's right. If I had this book in print, I would probably skim through the rest of it and read the last chapter. Since that's not really an option on audio and I probably would't appreciate the ending if I completely skip everything in between, I think I'll just give up on it for now, especially since two other, more tempting audiobooks just came in for me."

 There have been many novels about the end of the world, but there's only been one Apocalypse Cow. Okay, so technically there's 2 because there's a sequel called World War Moo, but still. The beef (and pork? and chicken? Awwww, crap!) has a, uh, beef it needs to settle with us. Hang on to your britches, folks, this book was moo-stly fun and udder madness! 
 This is going to be one of those books that you either love or hate. I absolutely loved it. I'm almost as hard to please with Comedy as I am with Fantasy books, but Apocalypse Cow hit the nail on the head. I did everything from snicker to guffaw, to choke on my food while I was reading. 
 ""But good looks counted for nothing when you smelled of intestines."" 
 ""Colin threw his head back to let out a laugh so loud and brazen in its bum-lickery it resonated through the office window"" 
 ""Behind wire -rimmed glasses, he had the eyes of a man who would strangle his own mother in order to get his inheritance early. Had Terry met him under different circumstances,he would have assumed he was a banker."" 
 ""Let me get this straight. Your plan is to sit here and hope the good vegan vibes you're sending out will protect us?"" 
 -Michael Logan, Apocalypse Cow 
 Basically, the government screws up, and this virus gets released. The food chain gets fried. At first its just the cows that are infected, but it soon spreads, and its a rip-roaring read with some shockingly gory and also sad moments acting as a balance to the hilarious zingers Logan casually tosses about during the udder madness of Apocalypse Cow. Its beefed up with enough action to keep the pace feeling almost frenetic, even when there's really not that much going on. The characters are disturbingly believable, though the representation of the vegan might offend other vegans. 
 I was surprised to find that I actually ended up caring about Geldof, the youngest of the crew, and even Lesley and Terry. The rest of them were take or leave (primarily because they were bull-headed toe-rags.) It was ridiculous, hilarious, disturbing and odd, and definitely supplants Year Zero as the best comedy book I've read in 2015."
3,"3.5 stars. I found the beginning really slow, but the last 1/3 or so of the book was quite fast-paced and interesting. Reading after that this is a planned 7 book series, I can understand the lack of urgency in the beginning."
5,This is as great as the first book as well <3
3,"3.5 stars 
 Peony is only a few days from her 16th birthday when she meets the man she falls hard for and he for her. Unfortunately, this is 17th century China and she is betrothed (as is he). 
 I didn't want to say too much in the summary so as to give anything away. Overall, I liked the book. It wasn't fast-moving. I was a bit bored with all the comparisons to the opera, but I liked the rest of the story. It was interesting to read the author's note (and interview) at the end of my edition to find out that this story was based on real people."
4,"1 star deducted for the awful ending of the series. 
 But Loor is one of the best characters in this series, and the conflict on her world was very well-developed."
2,"If the focus of the book had remained on The Agency and the puzzles and less on the insta-love, this book would've received far more stars."
5,"Wow. I can't believe it's over. After almost three years of avidly obsessing over this series, it's finally come to an end. I don't know how to feel. It's like there's an empty place in my chest and I don't know how to fill it. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll probably come back and write a real review later."
3,"An interesting premise, and a fun book. I particularly like the fairies in the garden . . . not your run of the mill Tinkerbell types. And Rachel is a great character. I could, however, do without the endless description of clothing. Harrison has taken a leaf out of Laurell K. Hamilton's pages and catalogs every item worn by every character in every scene, which is sad because all her people are dressed like high-end hookers from the late '80's. Or deranged pirates. There's a whole lotta leather-pants-n-puffy-shirts going on here. And, while we understand that it's a tense situation, living with a bisexual vampire, while someone is trying to kill you, you might want to set that aside and FOCUS."
5,"This book had a lot going on but I really enjoyed it. I wouldn't recommend reading it as a stand alone but if you are already immersed in Mercy's world then you've been waiting to see how things would shake out with the Fae and you won't be disappointed. 
 There are a lot of Fae politics in this book but you also get to see a lot of humorous, sweet, and intimate moments between Adam and Mercy. There are also some important moments within the pack. Along with all of that there is plenty of danger, action and suspense. This book does a wonderful job of moving the main plot along but giving us plenty of character driven moments as well. We get to see all of our favorite characters from Adam's pack (although they aren't front and center in this book) along with a quick scene with Bran and Charles. There are a lot of previous Fae characters who Mercy has some history with and plenty of intrigue as Mercy and Adam try to figure out how many factions of Fae they are dealing with and what they want. 
 I can't get enough of Mercy and Adam and I was sad when the book was over because I wasn't ready to be done reading about them."
4,This is such a heartwarm and funny book which is just perfect for a christmas read! Now I can't stop thinking about how much I want to find a red Moleskine and go on adventure and meet that perfect boy that lives inside my head.
5,"Taken from my book review blog: http://tinalizreads.blogspot.com/ 
 As with this entire series, I loved this book. I read this book in two days this time and I believe I read it just as fast the first time as well. There were parts that I loved more than the first book and less than the first book. What I loved more was the extra action and fighting and also the added mystery. I loved how strong Tris has become physically but how mentally she had become weaker after experiencing such trauma in the first book. On the same lines, what I didn't like as much was Tris's inability to listen to Four and how she would shut him out. I completely understand her decisions and why she did that, though, it was still hard to read given how much I love her and Four. 
 I wanted to jump inside this book and kill the characters who either didn't believe or didn't like the divergent. I'm going to assume their opinions came from jealousy because how could you not think they are incredible for what they can do with their minds? Clearly, they are more intelligent and special but whatever. Also, was so angry at Christina in the beginning. Did not like her at all in the first book but the last third of this second book I definitely came to like her a whole lot and am thankful for that since Tris's friends are dwindling. 
 I think it's funny how the second book always seems to be my favorite in trilogies and even some longer series. It's probably because the entire scene has already been established, as well as most of the characters, and so the second book gets to be full of fighting and crazy shit that is super interesting and holds your attention. The third books tend to be mushier and work towards wrapping things up which isn't as exciting. 
 Obviously, the ending was great. You really want this ""information"" Marcus has to be big and it is. I love the entire idea and I love who you find out is behind it and how important that makes certain people. 
 Overall, I loved rooting for Tris. I love how strong and smart she is. I love that she is naturally curious and suspicious. I love that she is a main character and narrator that you can trust and love. And I'm really fucking excited for the next book in less than a month!!!! I can't even imagine what will happen next."
3,"""I know you can be overwhelmed, and you can be underwhelmed, but can you ever just be whelmed?"" 
 ""I think you can in Europe"" (10 things I hate about you) 
 This is how I felt after finishing this book- whelmed. It neither failed miserably, nor rose spectacularly to the heights I hoped it would. Every part of this book only just held my interest, and that was odd for me. I've stuck by Anita through and through, but this book just wasn't the best in the series. It might be because Laurell K Hamilton is almost entirely ignoring my favorite male characters, and sending away one also. Would one scene with Jean-Claude have killed her? Plus now he's sleeping with another woman I just feel icky. I know it wasn't 'fair' for him not to sleep with other women, but it honestly creeps me out that Anita, the once domineering and non sharer, can just turn a blind eye, and all of a sudden has a female lover. I much preferred Merry Gentry; at least we knew from the beginning who she was and she hasn't changed as much as Anita. 
 So will I buy the next one? Of course. But I think Anita needs something, and I don't know what, to make me respect her again. It's the constant changing of her mind, readjusting of her morals, and the whole personality shift that is getting to me. I'm even getting bored of the usual repetitive descriptions, and I've mostly overlooked those in the past. 
 All I can say is thankfully there's a whole year between Laurell's books usually, so hopefully some great strike of inspiration happens and something actually happens in the next story."
5,Holy smokes. This book was addicting. Read it in one sitting *fans self*
5,"Is it a children's book? Maybe, but with references like Milton, it's deep enough for any adult. Pullman explores innocence, original sin, the nature of betrayal and redemption. Add a talking armored polar bear and who can resist? One of my all-time favorites"
4,"""Winning will make you famous. 
 Losing means certain death."" 
 so yes,I've read the Hunger Games. FINALLY!!!!! 
 We all know the story:16 year old Katniss Everdeen volunteers to partake in the games in place of her sister which is held to show the people of Panem that the capitol(this is where the big people are) has them by their balls. 
 I watched the movie first*so?sue me* and then I wanted to read this book.found out I liked it,the girl more than the book. 
 Katniss,for me is the epitome of a YA lead heroine. 
 she's strong.knows how to catch a squirrel(this counts),doesn't wallow in self pity and she is REALISTIC. 
 from the moment she entered capitol she starts thinking on how to survive.she doesn't look at anyone with disdain or doesn't look at them as if they hung on he moon. 
 she was cold-some may accuse her of that but I mean it as complement-she was calculating,yet with a hint of vulnerability,a hint of naivety. 
 and some of the parts had me looking for tissues.like the district 12 people giving her a salute,her making wreath on Rue.and the part where she cries for Peeta. 
 Peeta.....this boy,I dont know what to make of him.You see,am internally rooting for Gale(even though I know that wont happen).I want to like him,I do actually but to some extent. 
 some may say that giving importance to love triangles in a clear dystopia is worthy of an eyeroll.But I disagree.for 1)romance lovers would look anywhere for love,be it dystopia or the end if the world 2)I think,and this is only my opinion,that Katniss' vulnerability came from Peeta or else she would be a robot who killed squirrels(no offense) 
 overall,LOVED.IT. 
 Cant wait to try the next one"

 Amy is that insecure part of every teen girl, always worrying if she's pretty enough, popular enough, independent enough. Looking for any source of identity she can find. Amy finds her identity in beautiful Lila and badass Cassie, but when they're all arrested on prom night and the consequences are much worse than detention, she realizes that she still doesn't know who she is. 
 That's one of the things I loved about this book. Watching Amy find herself. From the beginning, you know she isn't really happy. She's the leftover friend. The burnout huddling with a cigarette, not because she really wants to, but because it makes her feel like she belongs. As a reader, I connected with her instantly. I wanted to hug her, to slap her, to tell her that she was making the wrong decisions. But even when she was her most bratty-teenage annoying, I never stopped rooting for her. 
 Burstein gives us a real person. Not a Bella. Not a badass hero. Just a bumbling teenager struggling to decide who she is and who she wants to be, with the threat of prison and a ruined life hanging over her head. I adore fantasy, but sometimes it's good to remember real people. How easily a few decisions can change everything. What it's like being a normal girl with normal problems. 
 Before I wax too sickly poetic, back to things I loved. The plot was tight and moved along at a snappy pace. Things were never easy for Amy, but never so hard as to be melodramatic either. You could imagine real people acting the way they do in this situation, even when they're cold and cruel. As for the writing, I had little to complain of. YA isn't known for good writing, but Burstein is one of those rare good ones. Her MFA shows through. It's accessible, pretty in places, snarky and funny in others, and only occasionally too overwrought with metaphors. 
 Amy's personality shines through in the choice of every word. I lost a lot of sleep over this book--because I had to force myself to put it down. If it doesn't make you say ""Just one more page,"" you can come tell me what a ninny I am. But give Amy a chance. Maybe she'll teach you a few things."
5,i love love love this booook. omg the best series ive read this year.
2,"So this book was a miss for me. I suppose I was expecting something different when I first picked it up, something more mysterious and haunting? But instead I found it kind of strange... 
 We're immediately hit with the knowledge of the house and what it is, but all the way until the end we never get any solid answers on it. And then there's the love story. Don't get me wrong I love a good book with mystery and romance but this book was unfortunately none of that. I despise insta love, and that's exactly what this was all the way through. But that's just my personal preference and I know some might not mind it as much. 
 I don't want to totally knock the book down and give it one star because towards the end I found myself SLIGHTLY creeped out. The idea of someone or something always watching you is an eery feeling and I felt like that part of the book, at least for me, was portrayed well. But then again I'm a big scaredy cat, so I don't know if it'd have the same affect on everyone else. 
 All in all I literally had to force myself to finish this book."
4,"I may be the only reviewer of The Hobbit who does not think it is perfectly enchanting. Honestly, I wavered between 3 and 4 stars... and I cannot quite explain why. So, I will start with saying that fantasy and young adult are both book genres that I mostly avoid, and that is influencing my view I am sure. But, I made up my mind to read the classics and this one was picked by a book club I am in so I read it. I actually had high hopes as I read the Harry Potter series finally a few months ago and it blew me away. Wow! It was such a revelation and pretty much had me convinced that I had been wrong about myself and that I was a fan of both fantasy and young adult books. And, perhaps this book simply doesn't live up to the HP standard. 
 I did wish that I had watched the movie at some point. (And that is something I cringe to say as a person who always finds books far superior to movies.) Perhaps the movie would have made all the creatures found in this book more real to me. Perhaps I would have better pictured the countryside, the characters, the details. But generally my favorite books paint such vivid pictures that I cannot help but see what the author wants me to see. And I wasn't quite there with The Hobbit. Several times I stopped the app, rewound and listened again. Several times I stopped the app and asked my son to describe a certain character. I just did not follow the story well enough. This may be all about me... or it may be that the book simply wasn't as good as HP and I had set the barre high."
4,"4.5 stars 
 Awwwwww. I'm always so afraid when authors come back to a series after a years-long break. To be perfectly honest, I was afraid this book might feel like milking a long-dead cash cow, especially since Cabot's going back to other series too. Thankfully, it doesn't at all feel like that. Mia is as Mia as ever, though she's a grown up too. Sort of. As much as I am anyway. Royal Wedding is fun and fluffy and also total Mia/Michael fan service which we totally deserve. 
 It's really nice to see Mia as a functioning adult. I mean, she's still a bit neurotic, and she always will be. In fact, she's journaling for the first time in years because her new therapist has recommended it for her mental health. However, Mia's also a lot more relaxed than she was as a teen, despite the fact that she's dealing with stuff that's way more difficult. Maybe because of all the sex she and Michael have. Maybe that's just adulthood. 
 Mia's 28 for most of Royal Wedding, which means that I really have grown up with her. I read my first Princess Diaries book probably around eighth or ninth grade, when I would have been slightly younger than Mia, and, though I dropped out when she and I were both sixteen, I'm back with her now. It's kind of funny how, if this book had existed when I was a teen, I probably would have thought the voice of Mia as an adult was inauthentic. Surely adults act like they do in all the adult fiction I read, right? Now that I'm an adult (I am, right?), I love the fact that Royal Wedding really captures the parts of adulthood that feel like adulthood but also all the ways that you and your friends really still kind of feel like teenagers. 
 I always thought when I became an adult everything would become less confusing, but unfortunately, everything's only become more confusing. 
 Obviously my favorite parts were Michael and Mia. At the start, there wasn't nearly as much Michael and Mia action as I'd hoped, but then, finally, they go off for their proposal which is slightly surprising for Mia but not for anyone else ever. I mean, hello, we know there's going to be a wedding, so let's get this train moving out of the station. 
 Though there's no on-page sex, sadly but probably wisely given the number of kids who might end up reading this book, it's still a really satisfying read ship-wise. There were some great shippy moments in Forever Princess, but there wasn't enough time with Michael and Mia as a couple. In Royal Wedding, we get to indulge in the perfection that is Michael and Mia. His emojis, for example, are just the best. Also their sex games. And Michael joking about the tabloids commentary on his sexual prowess. I'm pretty sure I literally squeed during most of their conversations. 
 Looking back on it, I guess I'm sort of grateful for the plot that I didn't like so much: Olivia. Mia's secret sister, not so secret since there's a book about her, feels a lot like when Gilmore Girls decided to give Luke a child. I just don't like her addition to things at all, and I don't really feel like she fits in here organically. However, what Olivia does do is add drama, meaning that Cabot didn't need to introduce any barriers between Michael and Mia. Though honestly I would not have cared one bit if there was no plot at all, but whatever. 
 The whole gang is present and accounted for in Royal Wedding. They're all like Mia: totally themselves with a new veneer of adulthood. I was really surprised by how much I liked Lilly in Royal Wedding. She's still very Lilly, but she's also somewhat settled in that she's training to become a lawyer which super suits her. Also, Team Lars. Tina's convincing as a doctor, but still freaks out over ships. Grudgingly, Team Boris. Then there's J.P. I was howling at his dystopian romance novel, and, honestly, I would probably be annoyed normally at his treatment in this book but he's really just the worst. I've also really come to adore Grandmere over the years. She creeped me out when I was a teen but now I find her hilarious. 
 Even if, like me, you'd gotten tired of The Princess Diaries, it is TOTALLY WORTH IT to finish. At least if you're a Michael/Mia shipper, and if you're not I really don't know what to do with you."
1,"So. Shelly Laurenston/G. A. Aiken has always been a kind of hit or miss for me and this one...is unfortunately a miss. Why so? The main problem I have with her books is always, always, always the characters. I know that this is a romance and I shouldn't really be expecting much (character-fleshing wise) from the hero/heroine but with Shelly Laurenston, I always feel that her characters are one-dimensional and are caricatures. For her, I think that these characters aren't really ""characters"" in the traditional sense at all, but instead are devices to serve up an example of her trademark crazy humor - which for me, straddles this border of being slapstick funny...and then just being stupid. 
 Since I'm pretty sure that all her characters are one-dimensional in one way or another, the thing that makes the books in this series and in her other Pack series ""make it or break it"" is the relative sane-ness of the character (or rather, how tolerable the personality of the heroine is) or how they mesh with their hero counterpart. In this book, I feel that Cella's penchant for acting like she's still 18 when in fact, her own daughter is 18, is ridiculous and childish. It's annoying to read the dialogue when she's continually teasing and dragging around Crush and then dressing up in inappropriate outfits. Who in their late late 30s talks like that? Secondly, even though I dnf this book, the reason why I didn't was that there was, imo, zero chemistry between her and Crush. No, I did not find her teasing funny and no, I don't understand why Crush just woke up one day, decided that he could tolerate her annoying behavior, and was like: This. This is the girl I wanna fuck. 
 No. Fuck off, ye cursed bad writing. I want to see development in character. I want to see characters that aren't just some rehash of previous characters - a character that is mean-spirited, overtly-sexual, and/or a chatterbox. I don't understand why she chose to completely define a character by the animal they shift into and then just broadly and carelessly paint that personality over all the characters of that species. I want to see Laurenston tackle someone who has none of the personality traits that I listed above. I mean, there is confident, and then there is arrogance and plain mean-spiritedness and like it or not, Laurenston's heroines often cross that barrier. For example, Cella Malone's response to nearly anyone who disagrees with her = punch their lights out. Like a spoiled child. 
 Since I was reading this on my ipad, kindle app says I got 88% of the way through before DNF-ing. I'm pretty sure I started skimming at maybe 70%, because I was really really hoping that this book would be alright (and also my work commute is 3 hours roundtrip by train so I was terrifically bored with nothing else to do). But I quit because I just couldn't stand the sheer amount of stupidity, stubbornness, and arrogance that is Cella Mallone. (As a minor minor side note, Crush was okay. I liked him for the most part, but he also felt one-dimensional in that he was defined very shallowly by being a bear shifter and therefore all bear logical, having bear traits, etc., etc.) 
 tl;dr Annoying TSTL Heroine, Stupid Humor, Shallow Caricature Characters."
2,"The beginning was so hard to get through...and Ever and Damen started to get really annoying to me. Ever was getting to clingy fo my taste, and she just DOESNT learn from her mistakes lol.. I was okay with Damen in the first book, but it seems like he just lost the ""edgy"" fun side to him in this book. The only characters that kept me reading were Jude and the twins. 
 I'm still planning to finish the series though..I'm hoping it will get better."
4,An enjoyable read with some unique elements. A trio of troubled sisters returns to the nest in their small hometown. Each must face coming of age issues while navigating complex familial roles. The novel shows off the gordian weave of a family; each member is at once an individual strand and an integral part of the whole.
3,"This particular Guild Hunter novel didn't really live up to the standards I've gotten used to. First of all, it started jumping around between characters. Second, it was just so much more predictable (or maybe I'm just getting used to the style of these books... maybe) and the solution wasn't that intriguing in my opinion. All in all, I enjoyed the novel to a certain extent, but for the most part this particular Guild Hunter novel is my least favorite. I still love the world in these books though."
5,"Wow! This book in the series is the best yet and has reminded me as to why I got addicted to it in the first place. Like Jaime says in her acknowledgments at the end of the book, please don't pirate her work. We won't to see a true conclusion to the series someday, yes? Then make sure that you're doing your part to keep the series going by buying the books. 
 Now, all of that said, I just don't know where to begin with this review. So very much happened and I don't want to spoil things because everything should be experienced as you're reading with this one. All I can say is, that Rhiannon went to a very dark place in this installment. Life has never been sunshine and rainbows for her, but now, it's even worse. There are a lot of changes and loss in this one. All of the characters surprised me. Especially Paine and Ethan (I still love you Ethan, but I wouldn't be surprised if you have some serious haters now). I was not expecting what went down in that mansion to go down like that. I know he made a vow, but I don't see how it could ever be possible. 
 Rhiannon and Gabriel. I am happy with the way that played out. Before reading the book, I was waffling on who she should be with. Now, I am completely behind the pairing that came out in this book. I wasn't sure if I ever wanted Rhiannon to forgive Gabriel for what he'd done, but he was willing to do complete penance. Like Rhiannon, I did not fully comprehend the trouble she brought to them all by leaving the way she did. And it was a crapload of trouble. Ethan's actions proved that. He told her some hard truths, but then he did something else that I'm still not quite sure how to feel about. I'll always love him, though. 
 In the end, several characters got what they deserved and a war is about to be on. I really hope there won't be any problems with Jaime releasing Edge of Darkness next year. I have got to see what happens next."
4,"Did I love this book? 
 Without a doubt. But like Six of Hearts I felt she kinda dropped the ball late in the book. The ending was too rushed & just a smidgen trite. Still the rest of the story MORE than makes up for it. Cosway always writes amazing female leads, the kind you want for your BFF, but Lille was a stand out, almost as wonderful as Fred, which if you've read Painted Faces, you know Fred is the pinnacle of lovable greatness. 
 And Jack? Probably her hottest male MC yet. In so many ways, lol. 
 Looking forward to King's story. I still have some heart left to shred...."
4,"Devious, gripping and fast paced, Godsgrave has almost everything I expected of this much anticipated sequel, some that was entirely unexpected, and has left quite a bit up to the last book to deliver. 
 Mia Corvere in Nevernight - artwork by JujuFei 
 Patience, sheaEUR(tm)d tell herself, whispering the word like a prayer. 
 If Vengeance has a mother, her name is Patience. 
 I have no intentions of discussing the plot in detail, this being the second book, so as to avoid any possible spoilers - Vengeance is ever at the forefront though and consumes MiaaEUR(tm)s thoughts, night and day. The plot continues shortly after the events of Nevernight, and it is a whole new world of dangerous that Mia is subjected to. Where most of the action in Nevernight took place in the Red Church, Kristoff has expanded the playing field exponentially with Mia traveling around quite a bit in her never ending quest for justice. 
 Did it entertain? Hell yes! In SPADES. 
 The story starts off with two different timelines, four months apart. The present storyline has you wondering what the hell Mia has gotten herself into, finding herself being sold as a slave to a Collegium of gladiatii or gladiators. The past timeline has her assuming her role as a church Blade, longing for her revenge, yet being held in check by the church for reasons, as of yet, unknown. We get to follow both these timelines until their convergence, where the reasons for MiaaEUR(tm)s present quandary are made clear. All of this is of course outlined in the blurb for the story, but I tend to skip reading those before starting a book, so everything was likely more of a mystery to me than it would be to many other readers. The tale was action packed and enthralling, the author's worldbuilding continuing to provide more and more insight into the fascinating place Mia calls home. Pacing presented no issues whatsoever, with those action scenes mentioned being staggered perfectly through the book. I would even say that the writing has gotten better, with Kristoff omitting much of the extra flowery verse that reared itaEUR(tm)s head in Nevernight, in favour of leaner, yet still beautiful prose. And the twistyness, o daughters, the twistyness. Mr Kristoff has shown his true, sly colours. He giveth and he taketh, he is ever so tricky. 
 Let it be said though, that this book, whilst compelling and fast paced throughout, never quite reached the level that Nevernight set the bar at, in my opinion. It hovered just below that level throughout most of the story, likely only reaching it and momentarily surpassing it with a pull out all the stops finale. I am not able to pinpoint a clear reason for this. I just felt while reading, that I was not AS engaged as I was with Nevernight, even though it was more than engaging on itaEUR(tm)s own. If I was forced to find something, I would most certainly name the following couple (pun intended), but these are likely just my own peeves with the tale: 
 Firstly, two of the main characters in this book become an item. Though this may be a subterfuge beyond my comprehension on the one characteraEUR(tm)s part, I absolutely, unequivocally, HATED IT. In fact, hated sounds too tame. Although being the same thing, 
 LOATHED 
 and 
 ABHORRED 
 make better descriptors, for one of these two characters have gone beyond forgiveness in my esteem, and should never, ever have been given even a whiff of the other characteraEUR(tm)s time of day again, after the events that transpired in Nevernight. Harsh on my part, but as Mr Darcy said: aEURoeMy good opinion once lost is lost for ever.'' In fact, the only way the odium* I have attached to this character could be removed is through his or her violent death. I guess my feelings are clear on this point. :) (*Yay! Been wanting to use that word in a sentence ever since Brandon Sanderson made me look it up in the first place!) 
 The second thing would be a lack on the authoraEUR(tm)s part in regularly doling out any kind of information concerning darkins and the bigger picture here. Once again, this is mostly just me wanting more, and likely not Mr Kristoff. The heart wants what it wants. While the story successfully avoided middle book syndrome, there is an overarching story line here that is hinted at throughout both books so far, and we are hardly given any progress on that front. The plot did move forward on the vengeance thread, but that bigger picture felt stagnant and I kept on longing for more there. Sure, there were some small reveals on this front, but apart from tidbits that me and my fellow readers at Buddies, Books & Baubles (waves at Robin, Kerry and Shelley) have somehow scrounged together into half plausible theories, we have almost no clue what the overarching story line is aiming at with only one single book to come. (Ok, some of us have less of a clue than others, looks at self in mirror, but luckily my friends are smart, sharing people!) Do you hear that Mr Kristoff? Sharing is gooood. ;) While this sparse dissemination might be intentional, we are hungering for knowledge here and I admit myself concerned at the amount of information Jay Kristoff will need to impart in the concluding book of this trilogy. 
 At the end of the day though, Godsgrave is an excellent sequel to Nevernight, and more than deserving of the spot it occupies in this series. I would have gladly given it five stars, had I not taken issue with that relationship and the balancing of the plots. I trust though, that Mr Kristoff will deliver everything I hope for in a final book of what is sure to be a excellent trilogy once completed and I am super excited for what is to come! 
 Did I mention that beautiful, dark & dangerous cover?"
0,"Recommended by Becky Spratford at RA for All (http://raforall.blogspot.com/2017/07/...). THIS is an alternate history I could get interested in. 
 Publisher description: 
 ""In the early 20th Century, the United States government concocted a plan to import hippopotamuses into the marshlands of Louisiana to be bred and slaughtered as an alternative meat source. This is true. 
 Other true things about hippos: they are savage, they are fast, and their jaws can snap a man in two. 
 This was a terrible plan. 
 Contained within this volume is an 1890s America that might have been: a bayou overrun by feral hippos and mercenary hippo wranglers from around the globe. It is the story of Winslow Houndstooth and his crew. It is the story of their fortunes. It is the story of his revenge."""
4,I found this a beautiful and quite haunting book. Its depiction of the afterlife as a place of repose and reflection struck the right chord with me as well as the idea of Susie's watching and seeking to reach out to the physical. There is a sense that in a life cut so violently short that there was unfinished business that Susie needed to see unfold before she could move on to a deeper heaven.
3,"So I really wanted to love this book but sadly it's one I just kinda sorta maybe enjoyed it. 
 Things I really liked: 
 #1. Sam. As a protagonist she was fairly well rounded. She wasn't drama centered or cliche. She was just a 17 year old girl who falls in love. No love triangle, no whining needlessly, just a 17 year old girl. Although this made her perhaps boring at times and repetitive she was realistic, which I must applaud. 
 #2. The side characters. Surprisingly the side characters (Tim, Nan, George etc.) made this book real and interesting. They each had their own stories and had time to develop as characters (which rarely to never happens in a first person pov ya novel). 
 #3. The dynamic of the two families. The Garrett's home was basically my home growing up. The stares and questioning looks. The loud home and dirty lawn, yup that was my home. BUt also I've kinda sorta know what it's like to live in Sam's home as well. I thought the author had a very good handle on how to write family life (not for the whole book though, she's not perfect), which not many authors seem to fully be able to grasp. 
 Things I didn't like: 
 #1. After about half way through the book I lost interest. I still liked the book but nothing was happening to keep my attention on the book any longer. I kept waiting for it to draw me back in but it never did (it was mostly the side stories that even compelled me to finish). The fact that I was so disconnected from this book took away from the shock and awe of the plot twist (view spoiler)[ Sam's mom got drunk and hit Mr. Garrett (hide spoiler)] . Although a good twist, I couldn't feel excited at this point. It came to late into the book. Not only that, the events that followed were even less interesting to read about than what was happening before (which was virtually nothing). 
 #2. Jase. It didn't really occur to me until about halfway through the book but he was perfect... too perfect ... He didn't have a single flaw. I think he may have gotten frustrated once, yeah once. I don't know why it bothered me so much until I finished. Every character, even my least favorite ones, had some character flaw(s) that made them real. That made them relatable. But not Jase, he was calm cool and collected 24/7 and waited on Sam's every command or feeling. And although that is what every girl wants it's not realistic or even likable. It makes me mad how perfect their relationship was when every other relationship in the book had a give and take. Flaws and all each relationship was real...Except theirs... 
 That's all I got on this book. Wish it was better but it was cute and funny."
5,"I understand this book will not be loved by all, perhaps not even liked, but I am so in love! 
 Ben redeemed himself in my eyes, reading through not only his journey but Bell's as well, was beautiful and unforgettable. 
 ""For a minute I can't help thinking about how damn lucky I am to have gotten a second chance at life. I was a dead man, a man who then lost sight of what mattered and then fell over the edge. But somehow after everything I went through, I was tugged back up by life and able to land on my feet."" 
 Ben Covington crashed and burned since he came back to his real life. One thing after another was thrown against him, but he slowly started to put himself back together into a better Ben. He may not be ready for a relationship, especially with the fiery red head that never leaves his thoughts, but it's impossible not to think of more when it comes to her. 
 Bell Wilde is an independent woman. She's moved out of her family home and is trying to make a name for herself in the business world, trying to prove herself worthy. Problem is, her focus keeps getting blurred with Ben showing up left and right. The idea of being Ben's girl brings her bliss, but she knows it's impossible. Especially with the secret she has to keep from him. The one she can never tell him. 
 ""Thinking past wrongs and forbidden fruit-none of that matters when I remember the night we shared."" 
 This novel was just so beautifully written. Plain and simple. The two most damaged characters in my opinion, now have an outlet for their story to be heard. Kim has written a forbidden and struggle-filled love that transcends all other romances. Each emotion from the characters managed to evoke the same feeling in me with each word I read. I could feel Bell's indecision and Ben's confusion. I felt it all. 
 What I really liked about this book was the moderation of the outside characters input. At first when I heard Ben and Bell were getting a book of their own, I figured it was going to be all about the awkwardness of their relationship in connection to River and Dahlia and everyone being against the idea of them. 
 Instead it took a deeper focus on Ben and Bell. The struggles they went through individually and together. It shows that before all else, they needed to be honest and forgive each other. Under all the lust and passion--which there was a good amount of--I couldn't help seeing how perfect they were for each other. Maybe it was due to their crazy and difficult past or perhaps it was the off-the-charts chemistry, but I saw it and I loved it! 
 ""What I feel when I look at her winds me. It's more than just lust and desire-it's a need to make her part of me."" 
 This has been my favorite book in the series. If someone would've told me that when I first picked up Connected, I would laughed in their face. As much as everyone hated Ben at the beginning, I understood where he was coming from and I didn't necessarily hate him, but I did toss him aside to some small, dark corner of my brain. However, after reading his story in both Blurred and Frayed, he has been one of my favorite characters overall. His complexity and time of deep despair brought out a vulnerability I don't often see in male characters. 
 I in no way want to take anything away from the two lovebirds that started it all, but Ben and Bell are hands down my favorite couple of the series. What they had to go through wasn't easy and their journey toward happily ever after was a wilde one [see what I did there (;]. 
 I of course recommend reading the entire series, but definitely read Frayed! Come on, you know you want to jump on the #BenandBellTrain 
 *A complimentary copy of this book was provided by the author/publisher in exchange for an honest review."
4,"Since Netflix is coming out with a series based on A Series of Unfortunate Events, I decided it was high time for me to re-read these. I originally read them as a kid, when they were first coming out, but I hadn't revisited them since. In fact, I don't even remember them all that well, so this should be fun. 
 The Bad Beginning brought a lot back to me. Snicket's writing style is very narrator-forward, with the (seemingly) omniscient narrator often breaking in to make observations, remind the reader of bits of information, and define words. (Something that I found hilarious as a young reader. It's not as funny now, but I still appreciate it.) 
 Another thing that really struck me as an adult reader is how honest this book is about how unhelpful adults can really be. It's nice to think that grown-ups will always do whatever they can to help kids who are in a bad situation, but the reality is that most will turn away and pretend that it isn't happening or that there's nothing they can do about it. I don't remember noticing this as a kid, but then my childhood was fairly full of rather useless adults, so maybe I just read it as completely normal. 
 Four Stars: This book was really really good and I'll definitely recommend it to people with relevant interests."
3,"3.5 
 I was expecting a light, fluffy contemporary. Not what I got. That's not a bad thing. it had a strong case of the instalove, though, which i find unsettling 100% of the time."
4,"An Artificial Night is where the Toby series starts getting quite good. Children are starting to disappear, and one of the First Ones is behind their kidnapping. Blind Michael needs riders for his ceaseless hunt, but Toby isn't going to allow her best friends' kids to be lost forever! Toby has adapted quite well to her role as knight errant after so many years in the pond, and she's collecting quite the array of sidekicks! This book also kicks off the trend of showing readers that a lot of fae aren't very nice, even when it originally seems that they are. Don't trust the children of Blind Michael, Luna warns. Ouch!"
2,"When I saw this book, like Meredith Duran's excellent Duke of Shadows, takes place partially in British India (modern Pakistan), I said ""sign me up!"" Unfortunately, this is not an excellent book. 
 Bryony Asquith and Leo Marsden grew up on neighboring estates and then found individual acclaim (him as an explorer and mathematician, her as a doctor and surgeon) before marrying. Though it starts as a love match, things quickly go south. (view spoiler)[ Bryony catches Leo in an infidelity the week before they marry; her love and trust is shattered, but she married him anyway for reasons that, frankly, don't make a lot of sense given her character. (hide spoiler)] After a year of marriage, they agree to seek an annulment and go their separate ways. Three years later, they meet again in the wilds of Pakistan against the backdrop of a dangerous civil rebellion. 
 The first third (roughly) of the book serves mostly to drive the reader crazy with unfamiliar place names and, worse, to make both main characters as unpleasant as possible. Bryony is so cold and abrasive, I wondered if she was autistic. It's hard to believe her claims that she loved Leo once, because she seems so aloof and untouchable. Leo is an arrogant golden boy who uses absurdly florid vocabulary and appears to be all charm and no substance. 
 As the ex-couple make the difficult trek back toward civilization, a series of flashbacks and difficult conversations reveal that the lovers are more sympathetic than they appear and their attraction has not burned itself out, but it wasn't enough to make me root for their reconciliation. 
 One of the underlying problems in their marriage was sexual dysfunction: Bryony was cold and rejecting whenever Leo pressed his husbandly rights, so he started raping her in her sleep (because by the time she woke up, she was already too far gone to stop him), and he continued doing so even after she begged him to stop, until Bryony killed a patient due to sleep deprivation and finally physically barred her bedroom door to keep Leo out. (Note the lack of spoiler warning, there: I don't believe in hiding rape scenes. In fact, I think books should come with rape warnings the way many erotic books warn of consent issues, anal play, etc. -And, yes: what Leo did was rape, even though Bryony came, and the fact that she turns around and does the same to him (twice!) during their journey does not make it right.) Since they keep up with the sleep-rapes after reuniting, I had a really hard time believing all that was wrong in their original relationship was right in their second-chance romance. 
 The Pathan rebellion was not nearly as riveting and gut wrenching as the Sepoy Rebellion in Duran's Duke of Shadows, though it was obvious Ms. Thomas borrowed heavily from that book. Duran's story felt so real and horrible I almost felt like I'd been there--I knew what the battle smelled like, and I tasted Emma's terror--but Thomas seems to have concocted the Pathan uprising because she needed some outside drama to get her protagonists out of their own heads and into the sack. Once the lovers' impasse is resolved, so is the military siege. Both resolutions feel a little bit forced and a lot anticlimactic."
3,"I like having this look into Levana's story, but entry in the series was much darker (and a lot more sexual) than the others (which I only mention because I know this series has a following among younger readers). I am also not the world's biggest fan of the ""disfigured evil person"" trope put in play here. That being said, I think having this piece of the story will make reading ""Winter"" much richer."
5,"A beautiful book. Story about Mattie,a slave wet nurse, and her charge Elizabeth. Extremely moving. Made me cry. Highly recommend. 
 http://crystena77.booklikes.com/post/..."
4,"Oh, the teenage angst in these books ... 
 I enjoyed this one ... once I get past the love triangle aspect of the series. 
 Evie rides to save Jack ... seriously, I feel bad for Aric ... but I like the thought of Evie with Jack. 
 The Lovers are definitely on team evil in this book. It was definitely action packed and trama-inducing for a couple of the main characters. 
 The ending though ... I seriously just about threw the book across the room. Talk about a cliffhanger!! 
 Can't wait to see where the story goes from here."
5,"This is not a retelling of a fairy tale. It is a deconstruction of fairy tales and storytelling itself. Easily my favorite Barthelme, this book follows a sexually liberated-ish Snow White and the dudes she lives with as they count the moles on her body and shower with her. 
 Evidence of postmodern genius: at the end of Part 1, we're invited to take a survey on how we're liking the book so far. 
 Made up words. Real words. Times when you can't tell real from fake because you realize you're not well-read enough to know but, in that very moment, you believe that Barthelme was thinking the same thing and was very, very likely out of his right mind, and there's safety in knowing that. 
 Logical fallacies. Obvious connections to the phallic. Saying nothing about the connection at the same time that it's brought up. 
 The construction of sexuality. ""In her chamber Snow White removed her coat, and then her shirt, and then her slip, and then her bra. The bare breasts remained."" 
 The phrases of assholes. You have to be an asshole to say, ""That will not ameliorate everything, but it will ameliorate some things."" I happen to believe, based largely on this book but also on Tristram Shandy and pieces of The Making of Americans (classified modern, but feels postmodern quite often), that every postmodern thinker / writer / artist / scholar is either an asshole or a dark little comedian. Or both. Or neither. 
 Alka Seltzer. Chablis. ""Healthy orange juice."" 
 The deconstruction of the psychology of Snow White. Deconstructed to the point of deconstructing psychology itself, as any good postmodern writer / thinker is bound to do. It is not just a question of Snow White and whether her prince will come to hold up the correct ending of the story, and it is not just a question of the anti-feminism implicit in waiting for one's prince to come, and it is not a question of the prince at all; it is an inward folding and unfolding of total nonsense that doesn't answer or even attempt to answer any of the questions even though, sometimes, it gets scarily close. It is a non-ism, expressed over some 180+ pages, with an ending that almost fits, though I do wish (view spoiler)[Snow White's sadness over the loss of Paul didn't summarize the entire idea of the book in two final sentences. (hide spoiler)] 
 If you don't ""get"" postmodern thought, you really only need to read this book. And then maybe listen to ""The Black Rider"" by Tom Waits a few times. And don't take anything too seriously except for the concept of seriousness, which is very serious indeed. 
 I first read this a hundred years ago in a lit class, and when, at the end of the semester, our prof asked which of the 18 books he should not have put on the syllabus, nearly every student said this book. I was, perhaps, the one exception. I've read it regularly since. Every single time I read it, I'm changed and lessened and compelled to do as the CIA agents do at the end of the postmodern film ""Burn After Reading"": throw up your hands and shrug off everything. It's meaningless, not that we're looking for meaning. Not that we're not looking. Not that we're nihilists -- that's an -ism, and those are bad. Just throw up your hands. Heigh-ho."
4,"Howling for You is a change for Chloe Neill as it moves POV away from the vampires (and Merit specifically) and onto the Pack. Fallon Keene is our narrator for Howling For You although it can be said that this is Jeff's story as well. Jeff and Fallon offcially met in Twice Bitten and their relationship has been rocky ever since. They are both attracted to one another, but Fallon, being the next Keene in line to rule the Pack, has family obligations that keep Jeff at arm's length. Jeff knows this and tries to be understanding, but it's getting more difficult the more he has to watch Fallon go out with potential suitors. When the Keene family crown is stolen, Jeff and Fallon have to put everything else aside in order to find it before Connor's initiation. 
 I think the storyline with the crown was completely overshadowed by the whole dynamic between Jeff and Fallon. I would have like to have seen more of the conflict with Fallon being forced to date suitors and not being able to officially date Jeff. Although with the little we did see of this (and the rest was just exposition) Chloe Neill did a wonderful job of conveying how truly saddened Fallon was by her situation. 
 I enjoyed this more intimate peek into the Pack. Hopefully, it will be something that we get to see more of in the future."
2,"PLOT: 
 Ahdieh was able to keep track of the fact that this was a retelling of Mulan which was clearly evident in the book. I was able to consistently know what scene from the movie that the book was correlating with. There were slight modifications to the plot but I mean if they weren't there then I guess it would be literally Mulan. However, I do believe the plot moved way too fast at some points and extremely slow at others. Things only started to get interesting past the 35-40% mark and then peaked up again every 10% after that. All in all, the plot was adequate. It was able to keep in touch with the story of Mulan although it took a while for the story to become interesting. 
 CULTURE: 
 Firstly, I would like to say congratulations of Ahideh for doing her research *claps*. It was really obvious that this book was set in medieval/fanatical Japan due to the types of weapons they used i.e. katanas (my favourite weapons btw), their hierarchy i.e. shoguns and the emperor, the names used (i can't spell them and I'm not bothered at this moment to look them up so just bare with me) and the mythical creatures called yokai. Ahideh effortlessly weaved the Japanese culture into her story which to me, was very impressive. 
 WRITING: 
 Ahideh's writing was ehhh. As stated above, she was able to keep in touch with the Japanese culture as well as stick to the plot of Mulan. However, I believe some of her descriptions were a bit long and irrelevant for me and I skim read many paragraphs. Also some of her plot twists were fairly obvious to me (view spoiler)[ i.e, the one where Yumi was Okami's sister (hide spoiler)]. 
 Ahideh's writing definitely improved from her other series 'The Wrath and the Dawn' nevertheless she tended to 'waffle' much more with this one. If you were to say that golden syrup was the plot and water was the description, she must have accidentally knocked the whole jar of water over. Also her writing of Mariko I found to be really annoying. Look below for more of that. 
 edit- 
 (view spoiler)[ I also forgot to add that I found it quite annoying that we never found out who wanted to kill Mariko, that should have been the 'major plot twist' at the end of the book or something. 
 (hide spoiler)] 
 MAIN CHARACTER: 
 Mariko. Can't say I loved the name, it sounded too masculine to me. I found it almost annoying, just like her. I mean sure she definitely had her ups but just the fact that she kept assuming (well towards the end) that she should be doing this instead of that was because she was a girl. Thats not supposed to be the point of the story! Well it sort of is but not stating it every single time something doesn't go her way. I also couldn't understand if she was supposed to be an (view spoiler)[ inventor (hide spoiler)] or not because it was only dabbled in like once or twice? Also the fact that it was stated multiple times that Mariko was smart and was able to outsmart people but in her 'battle of wits' with Okami she would always lose??? Mariko talked waaaaayyyy to much about honor and how she was able to relate with the people and how much she hated Okami that I almost dropped the book. She kept on talking about how amazing and strong she was but couldn't live up to it. She said something about having a 'strong mind' but (as said above) she would lose every spat to Okami? for the sake of hiding her identity? Not to mention that she keeping on calling herself 'just a girl' and tries to toughen up but whines about literally everything else. She needs to face the facts that she is a spoilt stuck up brat who needs to learn her place."
4,"I really responded to this book in a way that surprised me, until I found out that the author used to write for Degrassi and then I was like - oh, duh. Like all half-Canadians of a certain age, I looooved Degrassi, and this book is pretty much a book of Degrassi. Popular kid and nerd, family drama, bullying, sexting - it's all here. 
 And it's all weirdly heartwarming. Like, I was crying my eyes out at the end, which is ridiculous. I don't even like realistic fiction, and this is not a perfect book - Ashley, in particular, is too stupid to be believed sometimes - but I really liked it. The content is a little more mature than I expected, given the cover (and I thought SLJ had this at like grades 5+?? but that can't be right) - my 7th and 8th graders would really like this."
4,"I kept seeing this one popping up on tons of my GR friend's feed and after seeing high rating after high rating I decided to run with the lemmings and check this one out. I am glad that I did. I ended up going to bed a lot later than I planned last night as I got bogged down in ""one more chapteritis"". The action in the book was so great that I didn't want to stop, but finally I knew that I had to give it up for the night. 
 I found myself laughing so much while reading this one. I loved how these 2 neighbors met, I loved that finally Caroline couldn't stand the banging anymore and confronted Simon, disturbing his activities. I loved that Caroline named the harem, loved that she didn't back down from talking about them to Simon. It seemed like once they ""really met"" their conversations were so brutally honest. Their bantering was a highlight of the book, the way that each could come up with an innuendo about anything was great! Even all the text messages kept up with things. 
 I loved the set of friends, both men and women. I thought how the additional couples met and then found their way to the right person hysterical. 
 I was glad to see that Simon finally started to realize what he had with Caroline. I even like how he dropped the dead weight before really going after her. Of course things didn't go off without a hitch and Simon did have to work hard to get back in Caroline's good graces. I totally understood Caroline's reaction and even what she did later. 
 The trip in Spain was fun. I was glad to see that these 2 didn't just jump right into things, but continued their friendship. It did seem like they were putting too much pressure on the final night. I found Caroline's reaction funny, funny in the way when you see someone fall on ice. You know you shouldn't laugh, but you can't help it. I did love Simon's reaction, typical guy not realizing anything was going on until later. What happened next had me laughing again, first with Caroline's freak out, then by the marathon that came next. 
 I would love to read more about these characters and the craziness of their lives."
5,"Combining a classic western and jazz age drama with truly excellent vampire lore, Snyder's American Vampire has appeal for everyone. Thrilling, gory, and beautifully illustrated! King's collaborative efforts were the icing on the cake."
4,"Carver made a mistake; he texted his friend knowing he was driving. As a result, all of his friends died in a car crash and Carver may face criminal charges. 
 The novel begins days after the crash at the last funeral and days before the start of school. While attending the last funeral, Carver befriends his deceased friend's girlfriend-Jesmyn. Together Carver and Jesmyn grieve and support each other but Carver begins to have romantic feelings for her. While a different author may fall for the teens-want-a-romance trope, Zentner explores a sweet relationship between a boy and girl. In addition to a terrible loss, Carver may face criminal charges because he knowingly texted a friend while he was driving. There is a law against this and I don't remember what it's called but this added pressure leads to panic attacks. Carver has a supportive sister who encourages him to seek therapy which is unusual for a character in YA novels to visit a therapist in the middle of the story. Nana Betsy, one of Carver's deceased friend's grandmother, asks him to spend a day with her as a day to say goodbye thus the meaning of the title-Goodbye Days. The other families hear about Goodbye Days and request Carver spend a day with them as well. All three days are different. One was uplifting, one added to his grief, and one was enlightening. 
 Like The Serpent King, Goodbye Days explores religion which a lot of YA novels do not do and Zentner does a great job of including faith without it sounding preachy (pun intended). This novel opens a new conversation about liability with something that we all have probably done-text someone that we knew was driving. The fact the the driver answered the text, which is the obvious place to lay blame, Goodbye Days does not focus on that and I'm pretty sure that was intentional by Zentner. A second underused theme in YA that Zentner has included again in GD are parents. In many YA novels parents don't exist, they are not relatable, or just plain ridiculous but Zentner writers a balance of the very supportive parent to the hardass parent to the absent parent. Zentner also features a positive father. I was on the Best Fiction for Young Adults committee last year where we discussed 120 books and it was a running joke was that all the dads were horrible except The Serpent King. GD has lots of dads and they weren't all great but they were present and believable. 
 There are A LOT of grief books out there making it difficult to stand out. The plot in GD was different in that it focused on the person who texted and not the driver who texted back and the goodbye day aspect was out of the ordinary. However how teens deal with grief tends to be similar in all grief books. I enjoyed The Serpent King more because it was a surprise grief book. TSK also featured southern rural religious teens first which also made it special. 
 Goodbye Days has solid writing and character development. It included multiple themes and it is a great conversation starter."
5,"I am not enamored by the story of Dracula. I haven't ever even read Bram Stoker's version. So as I approached page 340 or so, I questioned my decision to read this book. But it's more about the story of a line of people who have been researching the historical Dracula and become obsessed with their research. The story was put together in an interesting way. You go back and forth between three main characters spanning about 60 years, and also read many ""historical"" documents that the people find in various hidden archives and libraries and collections all over the world. As a future librarian, I think that was my favorite part, reading about the process of putting the research together. Also the idea of Dracula's personal collection? Priceless."
3,A classic? Really? This horror story was remarkably horror-free and the ending failed to be predictable only because I didn't predict something so flat and obvious. You people who have hyped this book through the years: you lied to me. You lied to me!
5,"I know it seems like I've been saying this to everything I read but I really think this is the best pair by far. It's just that Samantha's books get better and better. Nate is just dreamy and swoon-worthy haha. I also love the fact that Olivia is a librarian. I mean, how cool is that! Anyway, I'll be continuing on with the series and see where this gang's will lead to."
4,"This was a great read and I'm totally hooked on this series. While the cliffhanger at the end is meant to be sensational, I understand what Nox meant so it didn't have that shock factor for me. Not a huge amount happened in the first half of the book but it picked up pace after that. Some twists were anticipated, others were unexpected. Superb writing as I've come to expect from Aleatha. Can't wait to read the next book in May."
5,"The Crossing of History, Faith, and Life 
 Geraldine Brooks tends to base her novels on real events, transforming them with her imagination. Her starting point here is Caleb Cheeshahteaumauk, a young Wampanoag Indian from Martha's Vineyard, who in 1665 was the first Native American to graduate from Harvard, founded a quarter-century earlier. Comparatively little is known about him, other than a few dates and a letter in Latin from his own hand, so Brooks was free to fill out his story in any way she wished. So while this may not be the Caleb, he is certainly her Caleb, first seen as a bright, agile, and independent boy, the son of the sonquem (chief) of his tribe, later growing into an elegant, enigmatic, and self-contained young scholar, among the most distinguished in his graduating class. 
 This, then, is his Crossing, from one culture to a totally different one, the master of both. The word has other meanings too. It refers to the physical crossing from Martha's Vineyard, not then the easy ferry ride to Woods Hole but a day-long journey to Boston that was not without its dangers. In a world where death is commonplace and few children live to adulthood, it may also refer to the final crossing, and the faith or fears about what may await on the other side. And perhaps it also refers to the Christianization of the native people that was the necessary first step to any advancement in the colonial world. Like Marilynne Robinson (author of 
 Gilead 
 ), Brooks has always had a strong religious element in her novels. While she does not quite have Robinson's ability to convey religion as a radiant inner light, this is much more than an historical add-on; Brooks' characters live within a world shaped by belief, and measure their actions by those beliefs. Yes, beliefs plural, because Brooks is also an unusually ecumenical writer. The dominant creed here is Christianity; in People of the Book, it was Judaism; and 
 March 
 is illuminated by the Transcendentalism of Emerson and Thoreau. Even in this Puritan environment, beliefs are nuanced: the island community was set up in reaction to the stricter laws of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and the tension between liberalism and restriction runs through the book. As she had done in her first novel, Year of Wonders, Brooks stretches to include people whose practices (for example as herbalists or midwives) place them on the fringes of acceptable belief. In Caleb's Crossing, she goes further, to contrast Christianity with the animism of the Native Americans; one of the book's strengths is that she remains open to both belief systems, even in an historical context where Christianity triumphs. 
 Of course, Brooks runs the danger that her story will seem altogether too politically correct, becoming yet another variation on the old theme of the Noble Savage, counteracting historical guilt with a strong dose of cultural relativism. Her solution, I think, is brilliant. She tells the story through the mouth of young woman, Bethia Mayfield, the daughter of the Christian missionary on the island. Although the Mayfields are based on a real family, the Mayhews, Bethia is an entirely invented character, brilliant and headstrong, a perfect foil for Caleb whom she meets on one of her solitary rides around the island when both are about ten. Soon the two become fast friends. It is she who gives Caleb his English name; he in turn calls her ""Storm Eyes."" Bethia is also precociously intelligent. Eavesdropping while her father tutors her brother Makepeace for the ministry, she develops a good knowledge of Latin, some Greek, and even a little Hebrew. But these are all forbidden pursuits. Puritan custom held that once a girl had learned to read and write sufficiently to handle household accounts her education should cease, lest she shame her future husband by her superior knowledge. This seems so patently unjust that we are with Bethia all the way in her thirst for knowledge. Recruited so willingly as we are to the feminist cause, we take the parallel theme of racial equality in our stride. Although some other reviewers have felt otherwise, I for one never felt pandered to or manipulated. 
 Brooks' other great achievement is the discovery of Bethia's voice. Although it can be very direct and simple, it has a distinct 17th-century cadence: 
 They say the Lord's Day is a day of rest, but those who preach this are generally not women. Even on the Sabbath, a fire must be laid, water drawn, victuals prepared, infants washed and dressed in meeting clothes. Those in purse to have a cow must see to it, for no one has preached to the cow that she must not let down the milk that stiffens her udders.It it more than a scattering of unusual words: victuals, in purse, sennight, bever. It can rise to rich poetry, as when Bethia describes her delight in the Greek pastoral poet Hesiod: 
 It is his night sky I see now, through the seasons: Arcturus rising brilliant from the ocean stream at dusk, Pleiades like a swarm of fireflies, Sirius parching the hayfields on hot late-summer nights, and Orion striding across the winter sky.Taken together, this all creates a remarkably consistent envelope for the story, taking us not only into an historical mindset but also into the thoughts of a remarkable young woman. Her love of words becomes our love of words, and our delight in reading becomes a wish to see her succeed. 
 The novel is not flawless. Brooks has always been better at developing her stories than ending them, and her epilogue, though ultimately very moving, involves a temporary drop in tension. Earlier, when Bethia is faced with a romantic dilemma, I found myself understanding her choice without feeling it. Caleb himself becomes less central as a character as the book proceeds and he gets swallowed up by the cloistered world of Harvard. But Bethia only grows in strength and interest, combining a restless search of knowledge with a deepening understanding of her own place in the world; she is undoubtedly Brooks' finest female creation, and that world is a remarkably complete one. All in all, this is among the best of Geraldine Brooks' novels that have read, far better than People of the Book, and right up there with March, which remains one of my favorite novels of the past quarter-century."
2,"For the first time ever, I'm going with the Goodreads-appointed rating system. This book was simply ""OK"", therefore I am giving it 2 stars. I didn't hate it or anything, but it really didn't do anything for me. 
 I didn't find it funny (or all that quirky to be quite honest), and the characters were all a bit bland. I was also disappointed that what I had originally thought was the whole point of the book (Bernadette disappearing right before a trip to Antarctica) didn't even happen until way later in the story. I found the lead-up to Bernadette's disappearance to be quite dull, and I only became vaguely interested when it finally happened. 
 I don't have very strong emotions towards this book, which leads me to believe it just wasn't for me."
4,"Spoilers abound, obviously, if Hawkeye is not on your monthly comic pull list, or if you are waiting for the release of this collection as opposed to reading the individual issues as they are released. 
 (view spoiler)[ 
 Bro, bro...the bro jokes are getting a little old, bro. 
 Bro? 
 Bro, seriously, bro? 
 Seriously, bro. 
 Bro! Not cool, bro! 
 In all seriousness, I thought I was losing interest in Hawkeye until I went back and read the issues collected in this graphic novel as one long arc rather than as they were released monthly. 
 Fraction and Aja are on a roll, and all those little bits and pieces from the first couple of issues are finally starting to form together into an overarching story, while still maintaining the non-serial feel of each new release. Turns out, Clint's pissed off the wrong people (bro!) and they want him wiped off the face of the earth. The job of eliminating him falls to a very creepy, efficient killer. 
 We also get to meet some of the women in Clint's life...including his ex-wife, his sort-of girlfriend and a certain red-headed ex-Russian spy named Natasha. We learn more about Penny, the other mysterious redhead in Clint's life whose connection to the tracksuit mafia sends Clint deeper and deeper into danger. 
 This collection ends with a one-shot told from the point of view of Lucky (aka Pizza Dog), retelling some of the events we've just read, and sending both Clint's furry best friend and Kate Bishop off in a new and unexpected direction. I find myself more curious about what that direction might be than at any looming escalation of conflict between Clint and the mysterious hitman fired to eliminate him. But I will definitely be awaiting the next couple of issues to see where each arc goes. 
 ""Hawkguy"" is funny. It's self-deprecating. It's unafraid to beat its hero up (more than once an issue). It pulls at your heartstrings. (The Christmas issue and the Tropical Storm Sandy issue were particularly stellar...and the Christmas issue is my favorite of the series so far.) It's about a hero, who's just trying to be a regular guy, who's just trying to be a hero. In a comic verse filled with lots of larger-than-life superheroes, it's got more heart than any of the other Marvel series I'm currently reading, and sets a different and unique pace. 
 I think that's why it's my favorite.

4,"I was considering skipping this book and just going right onto Winter after having read Cress because I didn't see the point in reading the short in-between story that had happened years before the start of TLC. 
 One of my fears was that (much like other people had said) it would give them a feeling of sympathy towards Levana and it would 'ruin' the other books, but really it didn't. I don't think that in any way I felt bad for her, or even liked her more, but rather I understood her character. Understood what made her do the things she did, understood more of Cinder's background. 
 I found the short story to bring overall clarity to the previous books. Definitely recommend!"
1,"I would have like'd to rate this book higher, however there are a few issues that make it impossible for me to do so. 
 First of, what parent insists on and forces there daughter to stay at home alone with a non related young male? Irresponsible, delusional, negligent and ultimately bad parents that should be shot, that's who. 
 Second of all, was it realy necessary to drag the whole my-brother-is-everything-and-my-mother treats-me-like-I'm-the-criminal thing out for so long? 
 This book is definitaly not up to the standard 'Just Listen' set."
4,"This has been an amazing series and Laurent honestly has become one of my favorite characters ever, but I just couldn't get rid of an impression that the first two books had been stronger."
2,"So I suppose this book represents a tiny landmark in my life by being the first roman that I've read entirely in French. 
 I do think that changes my opinion a little. As was confirmed when I went to France earlier this month, I am nowhere near fluent in the language speaking-wise, but I am pretty much there in terms of reading, and this was a nice little way of practising as well as boosting my confidence. 
 Anyway, I feel like I wouldn't have gotten along as well with this book if I read the English version. 
 It starts off with an exposition dump and I found myself laughing at the ""dystopia"" element, because it was nonsensical garbage. It would've been much more believable in some kind of fantasy setting instead; at least then I could suspend my disbelief a little further. I feel like it was just shoehorned into the ""dystopia"" corner because that's what was going to sell best when it was published. 
 Aside from that, it was a decent enough read. America didn't get on my nerves as much as I expected (though her name did), and I thought Maxon was a decent kinda guy, too - and note how I said 'guy,' not 'character,' because he's on the shelf with the trademark edge of blandness most characters of his ilk carry. I liked the way the pair's relationship was actually developed, but in doing this, Cass neglected developing every single other character. There are no stakes if we don't get a good feel for what the other young ladies in the Selection are like (and let's just say I barely knew who any of them were by the end of the novel, so there were absolutely no stakes.) 
 Oh, and the end isn't actually the end. It has a cheap pull for you to read the next book, (view spoiler)[ just like the end of The Force Awakens. Yeah, I went there. (hide spoiler)] There is no real conclusion. I don't consider this a spoiler, because people should know that the book they're getting isn't actually a complete story - and my friend paid 16,90 EUR for this chunky bastard. 
 Two and a quarter stars for the French version at least. I don't much care to read the rest of the series. 
 (view spoiler)[ Aspen breaking into America's room and basically forcibly making out with her is disgusting and invasive and selfish and not at all romantic. Fuck that. (hide spoiler)]"
3,"So I got a cold and did the best thing one could do in a situation like this: I hid under a blanket and embarked on a Moomin-series-rereading journey. 
 Somehow I missed this one when I was a kid. It's not the best book of the series and - as many other first books - feels rather half-baked, but it's interesting to see how most characters and events are already contained within this short story. It's almost as if Jansson is taking us on a preview tour of what's to come. 
 PS. Coming to think of it, it's also interesting that this series, in a way, started as Jansson's response to the Second World War. In the preface, Jansson says that she started the story in 1939 and finished it only in 1945, after the war was over. Makes me think of how the pre-war situation has influenced Tolkien and his Hobbit that was published slightly earlier."
5,"I laughed- or cackled- right up until I started bawling. This was just so much fun and utterly charming. 
 PS. Dodgers suck"
4,"actual rating: 4,5 stars 
 another book that was surrended by quite the hype and a lot of people seemed to love which basically resulted in me not wanting to check it out because i was afraid i'd be disappointed by it in the end. 
 but i'm really happy that i did decide to get this book and picked it up earlier this month, because i definitely enjoyed it! 
 the good stuff: 
 i really liked Cinder, Iko & Peony's relationship pretty much from the get go 
 i liked Cinder & Kai together and swooned a bit over the elevator scene, because come on. that's a scene straight out of any romcom there is. and it was cute and awesome. 
 the book moved rather quickly once we got past the whole introducing the characters and world part of the book. i found myself reading through the second part of the book in basically one sitting, unable to put the book down. 
 i enjoyed the Cinderella moments more than i thought i would in the end, which was a nice surprise. 
 the bad stuff: 
 it was rather obvious early on who a certain person is going to turn out to be."
5,"Loved it...heart stopping and emotional with a little excitement in it as well. Talkington I love your writing and I love your mind. This book was so much and so many emotions came out while reading it. I am not sure how to explain it but its SO good a MUST read of 2014! 
 When the most unbelievable things happens to Liv Bloom after only being in her new school for a short time things will never be the same. She has fallen in love with the one boy she never thought would be her first love, Malcolm, but after sneaking out one night to see him she never gets back to her dorm alive. Now a ghost she must find out what happened to her. Gabe the one friends she made before she was murdered is the only one who can see her, he is the only one who can see any of the ghost that remain at Wickham Hall. He will be the only one to bring her back to the one she loves and help her figure out what's happening. 
 OK I loved it, but let me say it's emotional at times I found my self catching my breath and shedding a tear. Talkington did such a great job in this story of heartache and mystery I never wanted it to end. Liv, well what can I say this chick caught a bad break and I felt for her through out the WHOLE book. She dies but she has no idea how and now she is seeing the ghosts that her friend Gabe tried to tell her about, but things are not right and she will dig into the schools past to find out why. Let me say it's a journey and its freaking and crazy one! 
 Since Gabe is the only one who can see or hear her she has to get him to help her and help her get Malcolm to believe Liv is still around. It was hard to read that part, to see two young people from different worlds falling in love then it being ripped from each other so fast. 
 Liv and Malcolm start to see each other but not out in the open. Why, well she is not in the in crowd but he is. They fall fast and hard and its awesome to be a part of it. BUT not awesome at all when things go down hill. I was devastated when Liv pasted I think I felt like she was part of my life as well. I really really enjoyed the art aspect in this story, it was super cool and I loved how these two found each other in it. 
 There is so much to say about this book but I can't seem to put it in words. I don't want to keep going on or I will be here all day and give to much away! This is a MUST MUST read of 2014 and for all ages. But be ready to get emotional and fall in love with 2 characters that will lose a lot and hopefully find happiness in the end..............."
3,"Stuck between 2 and 3 stars... Man, this book was something else. Poor Todd and Viola are never going to get a break, and in this book, they're not even together. Todd is being groomed by Mayor Prentiss into his own little role in New Prentisstown, and Viola is having her own guessing game of ""who's the bigger bad guy??"". I liked the slow, dangerous build-up, the pacing, and the two narratives. I absolutely loved the character of Davy Prentiss. Maybe I haven't read enough books, but the way his character was developed blew me away. (view spoiler)[ TOO BAD HE EFFIN DIED WHAT THE FUCK. I wanted to see so much more of him! WHYYYYYYY?!?! But then again, that scene was part of the reason I'm raising the rating from 2 to 2.5/3 stars, since it brought an abrupt, heart-ripping end to that ridiculous Mexican standoff. (hide spoiler)] The last 40 or so pages though... ugh. The switching narratives were stupid and unnecessary. I mean, I can see where Ness was trying to go with the new-found evil that Mayor Prentiss harnessed, but he didn't pull it off for me. 
 Oh yeah, and the cruelty in this book does not disappoint those who are into the blood and guts aspect of these books. There's water boarding, cattle-branding of various non-cattle, guns, explosions, and many broken limbs. (view spoiler)[ Viola walking on two broken ankles was almost as ridiculous as the immortal alligator-torn Aaron in Book 1 (hide spoiler)] It was difficult to read at times, but it was done slightly better than in the first book. 
 So... Shaky book with some bad stylistic decisions and one amazing character."
0,"I am going to give this another try, although not in the immediate future. I got 100 pages or so into it and gave up. I was simply bored -- this version of Sherwood simply was not grabbing me. But a writer I know thinks it is the best Robin Hood ever, which makes me wonder if it's because I tried to read it while ill. (Note to self -- never start a new book while running a fever.) 
 So...because I have loved other McKinley books, and because several people I know really enjoyed it, I will probably give it another try. It's a first edition hardback. I should read it and decide whether to keep it or sell it!"
4,Fooled me.
5,"Well, this book made me want to go straight to hell. 
 When Lela's best friend Nadia kills herself, Lela sneaks through the Suicide Gates of hell, in an attempt to rescue Nadia, which is where she happens upon both brutal demons and the leather-clad, blade-wielding Guards of the Shadowlands. Everything just gets better. . . or perhaps I should say worse, from there.

4,"After several books set in the past, Hoag is back with this taut, unconventional thriller. A riveting story that doesn't go where you expect it to."
3,Never in my life has a book made me cry this much. I read this novel in just over four hours. It is perfect. That is all I will say.
4,"I picked this book up on a whim with fairly low expectations. I feel somehow obliged to read authors describing women's difficult lives in southeast Asia, no matter how many I've read and been disappointed by before. 
 So it was a pleasant surprise when I caught myself desperately enthralled in the twists and turns of the stories intertwined to make up this book. Or at least one of the stories, since it quickly enough became apparent that the modern half of the story would find an acceptable resolution. 
 But the Shekiba part of the story? Thrilling! With every chapter I was left wondering what was in store and desperate to read on. 
 Definitely a fun little read."
3,"3.5 stars 
 The story of Jack and Morgan..... 
 After the cheesy beginning, I found myself struggling to get through the book. Jack, a dominate, is using Morgan to fulfill an act of revenge against a former friend. The turning point was when Jack realized his feelings for Morgan. After his emotions began to surface, the book started to flow a lot easier for me. The plot started to get better, because it wasn't just about revenge or some less than suspensful stalker. I really enjoyed Jack's ability to read Morgan and how he knew from the very beginning what her desires were. Morgan was a little annoying --not sure if it was the whole ""brother/fiance"" storyline, which was absurd to begin with (I mean, if you're avoiding a ""long lost sister"" tabloid story--the last thing I'd do is say that she's my fiance......Yeah, like the tabloids wouldn't have a field day with that!) Overall, I thought the erotica/dominate/submission aspect of the story was fantastic. Master J was every bit of what he promised he would be.(yeah, yummm!) I mean....Yes, Sir!!!!!!"
5,"""Memories are their own descendants masquerading as the ancestors of the present."" 
 Few books affect me the way Ghostwritten has: I finished it nearly two weeks ago and have been unable to formulate my thoughts into words. 
 I wanted to get into David Mitchell, and decided it best to start at the very beginning. I'm very happy about my choice. 
 The novel is made up of nine stories that at face value seem unrelated, but when placed side-by-side make a brilliant tapestry of interconnected human (and not-so-human) experience, making a fantastic statement about coincidence and fate. 
 Each individual story stands on its own as a wonderful work. Some are certainly better than others (Hong Kong and Clear Island dragged at points and felt a little dry, while Mongolia and Night Train were transcendent). But it wasn't until I closed the book that I was able to take a step back and see the full picture, which completely knocked me over. Part of my fascination with the novel is finding the details on each story that cause ripples in the others. It made me immediately want to jump back in and reread the book. 
 Mitchell is an absolute chameleon. I will admit that reading the first chapter, I was taken aback. I felt that some of the writing was silly and convoluted. Then, I read the next chapter and realized that Mitchell was capable of inhabiting a character in a way I've only seen from Willian Faulkner. The difference in style and perspective from chapter to chapter is proof of Mitchell's insane stylistic ability. 
 I will admit that there are some aspects of the book that are weak. Some of the connections between the stories feel a little forced or reek of ""retcon."" The most disappointing part of the book is its coda: though I love the last few lines, in general it felt like it forced elements from previous stories together cheaply. 
 Regardless of these smaller problems, the novel as a whole hit me at a very personal level and will forever be on my list of favorite books."
5,I could pick up this book anytime and anywhere and I would Instantly be Suck into the world that Rick Riordan created.
4,"I really knew nothing about The Boston Girl before buying it. I had seen it a few times on a bookshelf at Target and I liked the cover so I started reading it on a whim and I'm incredibly glad I did. It was beautifully written and I devoured it. 
 The Boston Girl is a historical fiction novel about Addie Baum, the youngest daughter of Jewish immigrants living in Boston in the 1900s. The book is from Addie's perspective as she tells her granddaughter her life story. The narrative stems from her granddaughter's innocent enough question- ""What made you the woman you are today?"" It's a journey through Addie's life from a young age up until the present. And she ""lived"" a pretty cool life. 
 The characters felt very realistic and they honestly seemed like real people. It was written in such a way that I could believe that the events actually happened. The one-sided conversation between a grandmother and her granddaughter flowed naturally and I really believed the story. The book takes us through Addie's life in Boston, as she finds herself and becomes her own person outside of her family. It's not as cheesy Eat, Pray, Love as it sounds. It also had really funny moments. We see her first love, her first heartbreak, her first job. And by the end of the book, I was sad to let Addie go. 
 It's no secret I love books with positive and supportive friendships between female characters and The Boston Girl had that in spades. The focus on friendship was a great feature of the book. Even as Addie outgrew her club and passed through several boyfriends, the men were never emphasized as much as her friends, which looking back, I think made the book more realistic. When you're retelling the story of your life, you're not going to focus on the men who made brief appearances, you're going to highlight the great times you had with your long-lasting friends. 
 The Boston Girl also covered tough subjects in a really great way. From growing up as a first generation American to PTSD, abortion, miscarriages and child labor laws, The Boston Girl had it all and I thought it handled these tough, controversial topics extremely well. 
 I loved the chapters of Addie working in the newsroom. She wasn't always happy there, but I thought the chapters were fun and exciting. I also appreciated that the first time Addie wrote an article, the thing noted to her was, ""Just make sure you spell the names right."" 
 I also really enjoyed the glimpses of Addie as a grandmother. As she's telling her life story, there aren't many moments of this, but when the fourth-wall, if you will, is broken, it was a reminder of their relationship. It was obvious how much Addie loved her children and grandchildren. And you also got the impression that her family really respected her. 
 I downloaded The Boston Girl on a whim and I'm so glad I did. It was the perfect read for a lazy weekend. If you're looking for something action packed, this isn't it. But I loved The Boston Girl. It was almost like reading the diary of someone from years ago. It made me want to visit my grandparents and listen their stories about their lives. And I'm looking forward to reading the other books written by Anita Diamant. It's early, but The Boston Girl will probably be making an appearance on my Favorite Books Read in 2016 list later this year."
5,"What a sweet story with lots of ""laughing-out-loud"" moments. :)"
5,"Loved it! i'm a pile of mush atm so glad I started this year with this book. 
 I love the addition of Maud and Helen. Helen is so adorable. The conflict was so sad and reflects on fanaticism at it's best/worst. 
 can't wait for the next one!"
3,"2.5 maybe 3 stars. 
 Ummm, what to say??? 
 Just a whole bunch of fluff. The writing seemed juvenile at one point and the ""heroine"" herself seemed very juvenile for a 25 year old. Her persona was that of a teenager, maybe 18 to 19. 
 Asher though.....whoo!!!!!!!! Loved him! 
 Proper review to come"
3,"Ok, I did wish for a cross-species action and got it in this book. But I felt a little weird out by the choice - thunderbirds! Nonetheless, I thought the action and fights were more exciting here than the bear episode (that was too short). 
 The part which I liked the most about this book was that Jace was back! His character shines in here and I could feel his desperation to challenge Marc even more. I'm not bothered with the love triangle mess, somehow I have this idea that Jace is just messing around with Faythe. And that his desire to beat Marc of being an alpha in a pride is because he really had no where else to go. I still cannot feel the love connection between them at all after (view spoiler)[one drunk sex. (hide spoiler)] 
 The downside to the love triangle is that it gets really dragging at times and the fights between them are just plain ridiculous.(view spoiler)[ If you have the time to squeeze in for sex(with both Jace and Marc), you surely have time to explain to Marc about it. (hide spoiler)]The reason why I don't care about Faythe's love conflict is that, I have no respect for girls who can't make up their mind and not ending the boys' misery any sooner. 
 I shall have no wish for the next book (like I did for this book) but will continue reading as I am at the last book of the series."
4,"I feel like I've been finding a lot of books like this lately. These depressing realism post apocalyptic story with these extra ordinary protagonists. I have to think its something with the theme of modern writing since I'm not searching these types of stories out but keep finding them in abundance. Perhaps the world is getting so wild and depressing we have to keep picturing it worse to convince ourselves it's good enough.... 
 (view spoiler)[ Anyway, about this book in particular. I cried at the end of this book. I see some other commenters complained about how much Ed complained and how unlikeable he was, but I think that was sort of an important part of the story. As he explained in the beginning, he was writing a story about what had happened and he was admittedly a poor excuse for a human being. The point is, he was able to change. He grew as a person throughout his incredible situation. 
 Another reviewer had commented that parts of the book seemed unbelievable. And that I could see, as some parts were. I think he tried to get all the different extremes of how people may react in this situation and had them encounter an example of as many of them as possible. And some of them were a bit extreme. The example that was given though (Grimes death) wasn't one of them in my opinion. I'm not sure what type of military training is supposed to teach someone how to avoid an unexpected bullet fired aimlessly into a darkened room. I feel like there were no holes in that scenario. 
 I gave the book four stars because I thought the writing was very good. The characters were all different but equally believable. The story was fantastically imaginative and even made me want to go out for a run (I don't run). I only dropped the one star because there were some of the people they met along the way that I didn't find too believable The teen mom serial killer and her neighbors being the big one and Jenny being the second. 
 (hide spoiler)] 
 Loved the book."
4,"They say there are two types of fear - the kind that has you running far, far away, and the kind that shakes you so deeply that you can't look away. 
 For me, Grayson is the second kind of fear. 
 I got pretty excited when I heard Annika Martin (aka Carolyn Crane) and Skye Warren were collaborating to write a dark, intense book that features a hero in prison and a heroine who is a college sophomore. I love, love, love Carolyn Crane's romantic suspense, and I'm also hooked on Skye Warren, although she sometimes writes too dark for me. But the two of them together greatly appealed to me. 
 Prisoner is definitely a dark book. It starts out a little reminiscent of Hard Times by Cara McKenna. Grayson is in prison for supposedly killing a cop. He is a big, tough, intense guy. Abby is heading up an english class at the prison with the intent of getting some stories from these hardened criminals to post as an online journal for college credit. When Grayson hears this, he knows he has to get into this class and code his story so when it goes online, his friends on the outside can decipher and help him break out of prison. Abby is all innocence and shyness from the outside. She has had a hard life with an abusive stepfather and a drug-addicted mother. She has made some morally gray choices in her past which still haunt her today. She is greatly intimidated by these prisoners, especially Grayson who gets right under her skin. She is definitely attracted to him and doesn't know what to do with herself. 
 Grayson we come to learn, has had a horrific past. Kept in a basement with other boys, he endured things that no child or even adult should have to endure. I'm not going to go into a lot of detail because you learn things as the story progresses, but it's bad. However, he bonded with the other boys in that basement and as adults, they will do anything for each other. Like help one escape prison. 
 So Grayson escapes - and he ends up kidnapping/dragging Abby along as he goes on the run and eventually into hiding. 
 Usually when I finish a book, I go right to Goodreads and give it a rating and then I sit down and type out my review. With this book, I needed a few days before any of that happened. This book intrigued me, and engaged me the entire way through, but I needed to process my feelings. The romance is not...romantic. Which, I think is the point of the book. Grayson claims Abby as his right from the start. She is terrified when he kidnaps her because there really is a good chance she could be murdered by him or one of his friends. One of the main themes in this book is how bonded Grayson is with his friends, and how they always come first. This comes across very well and frightening in the book. But over time, Abby comes to trust Grayson and she falls for him. Let me note, there is a warning in the blurb that there is dubious consent, and that is true. There are times right after escape that he makes sexual advances on her that she doesn't want (although inside her head she is okay with it). I think the hardest part is when he drugs her and then has sex with her. So - the dubious consent warning is in there for a reason. 
 I wish I had felt more love or romance at the end of the book. Maybe that would have been too squishy for this type of book or maybe it's just not in Grayson's personality or mental status to actually be truly in love. It was more that Abby is his prized possession and she is fine with that. While Abby's parents are dead, I often wondered if she had friends or other family members that were affected by her actions? That's never really addressed. And while there is much darkness, there are moments like this too: 
 ""Where are we going?"" 
 ""We're going to meet my friend in a secluded area."" 
 She gives me that look again. The flare of surprise - and a little bit of something else too. 
 ""Why, Ms. Winslow, please. Mind out of the gutter."" I smile and sit back. The smile is there to put her at ease. Stone'll want her dead. It's going to be a problem. 
 Another pair of cop cars heads over the hill. ""You just drive nice, okay?"" 
 ""Nicely,"" she snaps. 
 ""What?"" 
 ""Drive nicely, that's how you say it. Not drive nice."" 
 Oh God. Nicely. Correcting my grammar even at gunpoint. I'm so fucking hot for her, I think I might burst into flames. 
 My favorite part of the book is Grayson's interactions with his friends, the other guys that were locked in the basement with him. Their love is true. They each unfailingly are there for each other, are honest with each other, bare their souls to each other. Stone in particular hates that Abby is a weakness to Grayson and wants her dead - badly. His actions with her and with Grayson are chilling. At one point Grayson is injured and Stone is set on killing Abby and the interaction between Grayson and Stone is so well done. I assume we get books for the other guys and I'm very interested to learn their stories. These guys had horrible, life-altering tragedies and now live a life of revenge and broken souls. It's definitely intriguing. 
 I guess my final thoughts are: I wanted more out of the romance. But then I think of Grayson's past and that does not lend to having a great romance in his life. So maybe what he has is totally realistic and all he can give. I spoke with another blogger that had read this and she said Grayson going against his friends wishes and keeping Abby rather than killing her is his romantic gesture. And that is absolutely right. 
 If anything, this book will make you think. And feel things. And now I'm totally ready for the next book. 
 Grade: B"
5,"Hilarious. 
 At first I was a bit disappointed. I knew it was supposed to be funny. I knew that if I was reading this in my mother tongue, I'd love it. I don't know why, but it's the same with other funny books as well, like P.G. Wodehouse. When I read them in English, they're not so funny as their Hungarian translation. But after some 50 pages I got into it and started to really enjoy the story. And now I'm sad I'm finished with it... I hope JJ writes an other book soon! 
 It's full of great ideas, I'll take notes on the best turns and chapter ends, there's a lot to learn from this author. Thanks for the experience!"
3,"I am so torn over this book. The first 2/3 was mostly a 4 star read for me, mainly because it did give me serious Breakfast Club meets Pretty Little Liars vibes and I couldn't put it down. However, the ending was a 1 star for me. I 100% think it is okay to talk about mental illness in books, but when it highlights stereotypes that can lead to increased stigma and doesn't explore further beyond how it can simply aid the plot and be as shocking as possible, I personally am not on board with that. 2 1/2 stars overall."
4,"Welcome to a world filled with four kinds of creatures: humans, witches, daemons, and vampires. Only the humans don't know about the others, who can pass for human, if not closely examined. 
 I loved this book, the nerdy details about the libraries and books, the heroine, Diana, who's a not very powerful witch - or is she? Her budding romance with vampire Matthew is forbidden, there's lots of action and history. For a very long book, it didn't drag for me, at all, it moved FAST - and I jumped onto the next book in this trilogy as fast as I could get my mitts on it."
2,"Enjoyed reading it but definitely not as memorable as Beautiful/Walking Disaster. I kept waiting for the huge, life altering secret and when it was revealed I was so confused! That was just plain awkward and not really plausible, was it? Oh, well."
1,"That was probably the most boring book I've read in my whole life. Just blablablabing without purpose. Or maybe the purpose was to make us realize we're all ""Biblios""? 
 I've almost given it up but I promised myself there is going to be no half-read books these year. 
 Characters're ""flat"", I had a feeling like the whole story is being told by one character, not two. Riley and Beck, there's no difference. 
 Plot is ... what's the plot? There are demons and trappers and hunters but what you get? Heroine crying about her father being dead and having picnic in the graveyard. 
 I'm not going to read the other books in series."
5,Even better than the first one of the series! Can't believe how awesome this book was!
5,"My favorite Percy Jackson book so far, REALLY enjoyed it!"
4,"3.5 to 4* 
 Ranger finds himself at a crossroads. He left the Wild Men MC along with Talon and they both joined the Wind Dragons MC but Talon had family there plus his relationship with Tia and it seemed like he belonged whereas Ranger was alone, feeling lost, the last single man left in the MC. 
 While he loves the feeling of family that comes with the MC he's not sure it's really for him anymore, he long since lost interest in the easy women that flock to him, he can't remember the last time he had sex and he finds himself wanting more and he finds it in Johanna Chase a stubborn and independent police detective. 
 Faye asks Ranger to help her with a case, a woman has been missing for two weeks and time is running out. At first Ranger isn't interested but then he sees a picture of the missing woman Elizabeth Chase and he recognises her. 
 Elizabeth's cousin Johanna will stop at nothing to find her even if it means working with a biker. The more time they spend together the more drawn together Jo and Ranger become and Ranger quickly realises he's found his one, the one woman meant for him and only him but what chance do a biker and a cop have? 
 I really enjoyed this book, I loved Ranger and while Jo annoyed me at times with her self sacrificing attitude for the most part I really liked her as well. It started well and the first half is strong, I'll admit I expected more from the second half partly I think because in the previous books the author has usually thrown something at the couple involved but that didn't happen here. 
 I had a couple of small issues (I know when don't I?) but on the whole I really enjoyed this plus as with all the previous books we get to catch up with the other characters as well. 
 (view spoiler)[Elizabeth has been kidnapped along with several other women but thanks to her cousin Johanna, Elizabeth's face is everywhere so I have to ask why the kidnappers would risk taking her to a gas station let alone one with cameras. 
 Okay so I know this is how Jo and Ranger found her but it just seemed stupid. 
 Also she's not a virgin so it made no sense that at some point she wasn't raped. 
 Don't get me wrong I was relieved she wasn't but it didn't seem to fit, if it had been younger girls and their virginity was being sold then I could understand it but in this case no. (hide spoiler)]

5,"This book is darling! Another one I wish I'd known of when I was first reading chapter books. 
 It's a creative story that explores the love between a girl and her dog with such humanity that you can almost forget that said dog is actually a Luminary (Sirius, the constellation, to be precise). The mysteries unfold tantalizingly and humor is woven through perfectly."
4,"The Reckoner's trilogy has made its way to my favorite sci-fi series. When it came to the last book, I was especially ecstatic to see how the whole series would wrap up. Sadly, I'm a little disappointed by this last book. There were the obvious wonderful aspects of the trilogy, like the characters, and the Epic's powers, as well as the humor (David's metaphors). However, things didn't quite add up in the end and it left me rather confused. 
 Read full review at: Marvelous Eden of Books"
3,"The epitome of filler books. This is an easy read. An okay book. 
 I mean, I will probably see through this till the end but in all honesty, one of the things that's keeping me from chucking this series out of the window is my lazy ass--too lazy to look for other books since I'm way ahead of my reading challenge. 
 What bugs me is that most of the time, this is a major eye-roller. Though I admit that this may have brought out a chuckle or two, I think almost everything about this is forced and all too convenient. Can you believe that the MC went to a demon-infested land without a weapon and survived? How did she survive you ask? She was nice to the demon who tried to murder her. She says she's a pacifist but come on. Very unrealistic. 
 Boring action scenes. An abundance of cheesy jokes (WHICH I DON'T EVEN GET OR FIND FUNNY). (Still) bland romance. Uncomplicated and predictable plot line. 
 Hopefully, this picks up in the next book."
5,"Wow. Just wow. Rare case for me, in which I read the book after I've seen and loved the movie and ended up loving the book just as much. If you're just as late to this party as I am, read this book. If you're waiting to read the book because you've already seen the movie or vice-versa, the order you read or watch doesn't matter, in my opinion. I'm always happy when I can say both the book and movie are favorites of mine and I'm really glad to be able to add this to that list."
5,"Sixteen-year-old Hazel has an unexpected lease on life; she was supposed to have succumbed to thyroid cancer two years ago. Now she lives in a state of resigned uncertainty, almost without purpose, until she meets seventeen-year-old and in remission Augustus Waters in her support group. Amidst their struggles with health and mortality, together they embark on a journey of life-affirming love and loss. 
 I won't dwell on this book too much for a couple of reasons: 1) I get all choked up just thinking about it (I had finished reading this just a few days ago, so everything is still fresh and raw) and 2) since it was published in 2012 and was already lauded (and rightly so) by reviewers and readers alike, there's probably nothing else I can add that hasn't already been expressed. 
 Due to the prevalence of the disease, it's no longer so uncommon for a person to know someone with cancer. My mother works in the oncology department in our local hospital and is therefore surrounded by the disease on a daily basis. My grandmother died from breast cancer. My uncle has prostate cancer. It's pretty damn depressing when you can start ticking off a list. The fact that Hazel has cancer isn't such a shock; her age, however, is. 
 I can't claim to know what it must be like to have a terminal disease before you're old enough to vote or old enough to drink legally. I don't know anyone in that situation, so I can't even vicariously live through it. I truly appreciate the way John Green provided two distinct points-of-view through Hazel and Augustus. Hazel is concerned about leaving the smallest imprint possible after she dies. As she so eloquently puts it: 
 ""I'm a grenade and at some point I'm going to blow up and I would like to minimize the casualties, okay?...I just want to stay away from people and read books and think and be with you guys because there's nothing I can do about hurting you; you're too invested...I can't be a regular teenager, because I'm a grenade."" 
 Augustus, in the meantime, is all about leaving a mark: 
 ""If you don't live a life in service of a greater good, you've gotta at least die a death in service of a greater good, you know? And I fear that I won't get either a life or a death that means anything."" 
 Obviously, death is inevitable, but most people who live long lives tend to just drift away in the end, perhaps satisfied that they've done what they could with the length of time they were given. But when that time is short--unfairly short--what would your approach be? There is no right or wrong answer and, as I discovered as I read, these opposing outlooks on life complemented each other as much as they clashed. 
 The fault is in their stars, and these two teenagers do the best they can with the unjust circumstances they were dealt. It was simple enough for me to guess the outcome of the story, but the way Green executes the journey of Hazel and Augustus is what makes this beautiful (yes, beautiful) tale memorable and heartbreaking."
2,"This completely fell apart for me once I decided I didn't like the narrator (dude needs to get a life) or any of the other characters. Also, always on the lookout for the signature Sarah Waters twist, I figured out who was responsible for ""the little stranger"" fairly early on and that basically killed any suspense for me. I ended up skimming through the last several chapters just to get through it. I know this author is capable of much better. She does period detail and atmosphere well, but the plot and characters here did not impress me at all. Overall, very disappointing."
5,"The first two books in this series were amazing so I had very high hopes for this one and it did not disappoint. The book starts exactly where Half Black soul ended; with Alexa, her recently rescued mother and Kayden racing back to two rivers to rescue Nelly. H.D. Gordon is incredible at writing gripping, page turning books and The Rise is no exception, there are many unexpected twists that take the story in an entirely different direction to what you expect. Secrets that people have been hiding start to come out during this book and several new POV's are used that give you a deeper look into some of the characters. 
 Alexa and Kaydens relationship develops a lot in ways I really enjoyed; their chemistry is portrayed very well and is 100% believable. I'm not going to mention anything about Jackson in this review, you will just have to read the book to find out what happens with him :P By far one of my favourite parts of this book was Nelly, in the previous books she was just Alexa's weak, gentle sister that always needed protecting but in this book you get to see an entirely different and unexpected side of her. 
 I didn't think this series could get any better than it already was but this book has made it even better. This is a book that I would not only recommend you read but I would almost demand that you read it, it's just too good to miss. I can't wait to see what the author is going to do with the final book in the series. 
 *I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review, this has not affected my review in any way*"
1,"So difficult to get into. Inexplicably, the first chunk of the book functions as a sort of prologue, only it seems to be the random musings of a person, and they are not terribly engaging. The plot does pick up ... 200 pages later, but ultimately, I'm not sure the payoff is worth it. I'm convinced that Murdoch is a talented writer, but the way the story is written didn't really pull me in."
2,"I hoped Insurgent would be like Divergent or even better.... 
 But, sadly, I was pretty wrong. 
 It never grabbed me like the first book of the trilogy did. Maybe the problem is in me because lots of people say they did like it as much as the first one.But, well, sorry guys, the whole book was how Tris makes everything to die because all those people have died for her or because of her. I don't know for you people but I think that's a really good reason not to want to die but to want to STAY FUCKING ALIVE. 
 And of course, when Tris gets what she so much wanted, she is like: Oh, no ! I don't want to die!No! 
 I was really pissed at her. She was getting on my nerves so bad. 
 I give two stars because of sympathy and because I enjoyed Divergent. 
 *The END*"
4,"I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that, 'cuz honestly you turned out to be the best thing I never had. -- Best Thing I Never Had, Beyonce 
 Honestly, in the beginning I thought Cheyenne was one of these rich stuck-up girls, that spend their money on , well... fake boyfriends. Though, my opinion changed. Reading this book I fell in love with both her and Cole. Who wouldn't want tattooed guy who adores you, right?"
3,"I received a copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review 
 Actual rating: 3.5 (1st part: 4 stars, the 2nd: 3 stars) 
 ""Have I cheated death again? Hades must be allergic to me"" 
 I'm impressed. ""A Promise of Fire"" positively surprised me and definitely managed to exceed my expectations. It was a captivating and mesmerizing reading. A perfect blend of action, sizzling romance and Greek mythology skilfully woven together. Evocative and fluent writing helped to create a mesmerizing world full of enthralling characters, spinning together a fascinating story. 
 I loved Catalia whose sarcasm reminded me of my own but Griffin, Carver, Kato & Flynn were a great source of endless fun too. And let's not forget Griffin's sister and family! Their dinners together were so entertaining! I absolutely adored how every one of the characters was intriguing in her/his own right. 
 I must say that, in the end, the romance won me over. I didn't like Griffin that much, the masculine dominant type not being really my cup of tea. Sort of. But I ended up liking him and Cat has an item. Although, He kidnapped her but I must say I found him quite agreeable, he never treated her badly and was often very respectful of her. Catalia on her part complained a lot but as - she herself admitted - was never in any real discomfort (except the kidnapping part that is). I was under the impression that most of the time she complained a lot just to not make the Beta team life easy and as reaction to feelings she didn't understand. Given her past, I guess that it is more than understandable. Anyway, by the end I really liked not only Cat & Griffin but also the whole team. It was definitely endearing to see Cat ending up teaching Kato & Flynn, sharing jokes and so on. 
 Back to the topic of Cat & Griffin, it was so damn fun to see Cat trying to resist Griffin's charms and her own feelings for him at all costs. And yes, Griffin was maybe a bit insistent but never felt abusive or overwhelming, straddling the line between sheer stubbornness and mischievous flirting. Add the fact that the romance add its own divine reason to be---* Well played Amanda!* 
 In addition to everything I have mentioned so far, the book also had a fair amount of action, twists, divine plotting and political intrigue. It was a page-turner up to the very end, almost. Yes, you read it right. Sadly, the whole plot suffered an abrupt stop toward the end due to ""make-up scenes overload"". Let me explain, throughout the book there was a fair amount of spicy scenes, well written and blended together with good plot and action. However, at some point, at the end of the book, everything stops happening and you find yourself with a chunk of pages full of lengthy make out scenes that separately might have worked perfectly but put together one after another just crashed the overall pace and bored me to death. On me, it had the same effect of an icy shower. 
 Overall, ""A Promise of Fire"" remains a very promising start for what looks like an intriguing and scorching new trilogy. 
 I'm already looking forward to know more about every one of the characters (yes, they were that good!), I'm dying to know Cat's secrets and have the burning need to know how the threads will now unravel--I need the second book! (Like now?) 
 I'll be definitely keeping an eye out for the Kingmaker trilogy as should you!

3,Review to come. Someday. Preferably this year.
4,"It could be a great book with a refreshing attitude from main character. I enjoyed following the story from antihero's point of view. I liked that the heroine doesn't see the world through rose-colored glasses and rightfully doesn't trust anyone, even her sister. However the love triangle spoiled it for me. With it the book just became another trite example of mediocre Young Adult literature."
3,"I'm really starting to have a problem with how often Janet Stephanie thinks of overweight people as ""fatties."" Stephanie eats like a pot-smoking college kid, she just happens to have a pretty decent metabolism so she doesn't put on the pounds. I love these books, don't get me wrong, but I find it hard to love a character who looks down at other people who share her weaknesses. 
 And I'll never understand why some authors feel it's fine to body-shame people of any size. 
 Knocking two stars off this one out of sheer frustration, which is a shame, since this is the book that introduces Sally & he's one of my faves in the series. It's also one of the most laugh-out-loud funny, but some things are pet peeves and the body-shaming is one for me."
3,"Not part of her series & her first book of all, I think. Not bad."
3,"Borrowed from Julie at the cottage, where several of us read it during the course of the weekend. It was that it was entertaining (as long as you didn't think too hard), engaging and moved really well. The big problem that I had was that the whole thing really did feel like fan service. It added nothing new and significant to the conversation, and quite honestly, (view spoiler)[Harry especially was kind of a prat, which didn't feel true to him at all (hide spoiler)]. It felt like a guilty pleasure that tasted good at the time, but left an aftertaste of not so much."
4,Every older woman's dream. A hot young man who can't get enough of her after she's been dumped by the man who was suppose to love her forever. Mia falls for Gray her son's best friend. This is their story and how they fall in love and what they do to stay together. (view spoiler)[ The only thing that would of made this book better is what her ex-husband and Gray's mom had to say. I would of loved their reaction to it all. To have their faces rubbed in it.(view spoiler)[ (hide spoiler)] (hide spoiler)]
5,"Kristen Ashley you are the queen of books, the queen of hero's, the queen of heroines and the queen of epilogues!I.LOVE.YOU. 
 I LOVED CREED. I LOVED SYLVIE. 
 I CRIED, I LAUGHED, I SWOONED (MULTIPLE TIMES)AND CRIED SOME MORE. 
 GET THIS BOOK, READ IT AND FEEL AS SATISFIED AS ME AFTERWARDS :)"

 and..... 
 Because all I did was this........ 
 And it was.......... 
 4.5 STARS!!! 
 ""...if I had your love I wouldn't waste it like he does. He's playing a game with you. He'll regret pushing you away, though, when he realizes I'm here, waiting to catch you."" 
 If you loved the Cityscape series, you will absolutely love this one! And, if you haven't read Cityscape, I guarantee once you read Slip of the Tongue it will be the next book you devour. 
 Once again, Jessica Hawkins has somehow gotten me excited about toeing the line of infidelity. There is just something about the way her writing and choice of words mixed with her signature sexiness creates the perfect storm of a story. Jessica has an uncanny ability to pull you in literally from the very first page and not let go. The descriptiveness of not only Sadie's thoughts and feelings but of the sights, sounds, and surroundings pick you up and put you inside the story to experience it right alongside Sadie, Nathan, and Finn. Everything is palpable, and Jessica makes you feel it all. 
 This book was ridiculously real, full of anticipation, and simply AMAZING. Jessica's stories are always mature and well written with likable characters and Slip of the Tongue is no exception. Her writing is smart with a wonderful style and flow that had me flying through the book without even realizing it. 
 From reading the blurb, I bet you have it all figured out. You already pegged the one at fault. Am I right? Well, don't be so sure of yourself. Jessica Hawkins will send you on a roller coaster ride that will have you changing your mind right up until the very end. 
 ****An advance reading copy was generously provided to me in exchange for an honest review."
2,"The Hades/Persephone myth is one of my favorites, so I was interested in reading this book. I didn't even finish the last (and only other) Meg Cabot book I tried to read, but I thought I'd give this one a chance. I ended up wanting to throw the book against the wall pretty much the entire time I was reading it. 
 My main problem with it is that I HATE Cabot's writing style. I can't stand her fragmentary sentences, way too many of which begin with except, because, or of course. The way she interrupts her sentences with em dashes and parentheses jars me out of the story, and she says so much between them that I forget the sentence I was reading in the first place. Also the way she formatted her book, going back and forth between events from now and two years ago and alluding to things that she wasn't even going to talk about for several chapters, was confusing and annoying for me. And the repetition. Was it really necessary to describe a dress as too-tight every time she mentioned it within a mere few pages? Get some new adjectives. Finally, why on earth was I subjected to the constant reiteration of Check yourself before you wreck yourself, as if it was somehow meaningful or pertinent to the story? 
 Even without these annoyances, I don't think I could have enjoyed this as much as I would have liked. The romance between Pierce and John was underdeveloped and not very exciting. The way Cabot described John's appearance was very hot, but unfortunately he had the personality of a wet dishrag. So did Pierce, who was also unbelievably stupid. Not only did she not know who Homer was, but she had to take her written driver's test forty-something times and STILL didn't pass. REALLY??? I wish Cabot hadn't introduced the whole Furies thing, because it just seemed a convenient way to have enemies come after Pierce, and all because they hate John. It felt so . . . underwhelming. 
 And what kind of crazy-ass parents who sent their equally crazy daughters to that girls' school in Connecticut wouldn't be at least a little alarmed about a teacher supposedly having an affair with a student? Who had just committed suicide? Especially when some of those girls had seen the teacher touch Pierce's knee in an inappropriate manner? Good grief."
4,Finally finished it :D! (Like three days ago xD)
1,I tried. I really did. But every freaking time I picked this book back up I was assaulted by cliched ridiculousness. Sometimes it went on for pages and PAGES . . . and so . . . I had to quit.
4,"Not what I expected but magnificent all the same. If you think that The Immortal Rules will be like The Iron Fey, think again. Other than both being great books, they have nothing in common. While The Iron Fey is beautiful and fantastical, The Immortal Rules is dark and gritty. 
 First of all, the world-building is flawless. There is not a single hole in the world that Julie created. It's incredible how she makes a world taken over by vampires seem like a legitimate possibility. Not only the world building is seamless, but also how she portrayed vampires. These are not the sexy vampires or the tame vampires we've all seem time and time again (yes, I'm talking to you Twilight). These are cutthroat monsters that literally have no choice to drink human blood lest they go mad. The coolest part? They cry tears of blood. I don't know why I liked that so much, but I thought it was the perfect touch to the type of vampires Julie created. 
 Allie, the main character, is one of the toughest chicks I've read about. She has that same touch that Julie's female characters seem to have: She can kick your but and not even blink about it. Seriously, even before she became a vampire, she still knew how to take anyone down and it only multiplies when she becomes a vampire and gets her hands on a katana. What's especially nice is that she accepts what she becomes. She doesn't boo-hoo about it, doesn't fall into self-loathing. Sure, she isn't fond of having to drink blood and especially not fond of the possibility that her Hunger will take over and she'll kill someone unintentionally, but she accepts the reality of what she is and makes the best of it. See, that's how a vampire works. They are HUMAN blood-suckers and they don't apologize about it. No reverting to animal blood here, thankfully. 
 Zeke, the love interest, is beyond adorable. Oh my goodness, I just adored him. Despite the misery of his past and the terrible circumstances of the present, he still manages to be kind and helpful (totally the opposite to Allison, who developed a demanding survival instinct after growing up on the Fringe).Not to say he can't take down any human or vampire that dares attack his group, or any person. Because he totally can. I cannot even put into words how amazing this guy is. If you had wanted more Ash, don't worry; there is another guy totally worthy of getting obsessed with to drool over :) 
 The other characters are all intriguing in their own way. Jeb, the leader of the human group, is a total psycho but still a psycho with dimension. (BTW, when you see why a call him a psycho, your mouth will drop. He is not right in the head at all) Kanin, Allie's creator, brings about some mixed emotions but you still end up fond of him. Caleb...I fell in love with that little boy. He was so cute and sweet. He reminded be of Ethan Chase from the Iron Fey. He had that same endearing quality that just makes you adore him. 
 The story-line is totally original. You will never see what's coming. It's surprise after surprise. And the ending...if I hadn't been falling asleep over my nook out of determination to finish the book I would have burst into tears. It's a great ending and it made sense that the story went that way but it was heartbreaking. I...ugh, I can't even describe the knot of emotions I feel about that ending. The only coherent thought I can get out of them is: I need the next book NOW. I just have to find out what happens next. I can't handle the anxiety of waiting to see what happens to these characters that I've grown to love. The only problem I have is a small one. A few times I would suffer in confusion for a little before something or another was explained. It wasn't a huge problem and it doesn't affect the rest of to book too much but some people might be more bothered about it than I was. 
 Bottom line: The Immortal Rules is brilliant. If you liked the Iron Fey, you'll like this one. They both have that special Kagawa touch that seem to make any book become spectacular. 
 4/5 
 Thanks you Netgalley and Harlequin TEEN for an advance copy. You're awesome!"
1,I could not finish this book because I could get into it. Not as funny as the other Stephenson's. Too dry maybe. First time in a long time that I give up on a book.
3,"Not one of my favourite Roald Dahl's as a kid, although I didn't dislike it."
5,"Loved this! 
 Written in Brent's POV and I wouldn't have it any other way. This was funny, engaging, steamy, explosive with lots of melt-your-heart moments. Enjoyed everything about it... from the courtroom sparring to their crazy families, amazing colleagues and the beautiful epilogue! 
 A MUST read!"
4,"As Monsieur and Bandette continue their Great Thieving Race, a new threat joins the scene: Il Tredici, the Strangler! Bandette wraps Absinthe into a neat package to be turned into the police, particularly Inspector Belgique. 
 I think the most enjoyable part of this for me was the collection of short stories by Paul Tobin with other artists - I still love Colleen Coover's work, don't get me wrong - but I've had a long time crush on Ron Chan and one of the shorts features his lovely work!"
5,"Strangely fascinating. I know what I would like to happen to my body when I am gone. 1) If appropriate, donate organs. 2) Donate body to science. 3) Promession (Freeze dried and essentially turned into mulch). That last one is a much more environmentally-friendly alternative to cremation. 
 In truth, though, I agree with the author in that after organ donation, it is really up to my family to decide what they want to do with my body. What do I care? I won't be here anymore. :)"
5,"Ug......I just love this series. The characters are adorable, there is just enough drama to keep it interesting mixed in with all the sweetness. Also minimal teen angst which is always nice. I also love that the characters aren't all perfect. Cricket has funny hair and is skinny and tall. St. Clair was short and bit his nails. Yet they're perfect in their flaws. Love it."
2,"I read this, I finished it less than five mintues ago, and I don't know what I think about it. I'm not a Jane Eyre fangirl, but the idea of telling the story of the madwoman wife in the attic is an intriguing idea and taking the scant details that we know of her and fleshing it out into a prequel of sorts is interesting. 
 Except that I'm not sure that Wide Sargasso Sea was really fleshing out anything. Frankly, it's the kind of alternate narrative, post-modern, vaguely pretentious novel that literature professors would love. It's short, so I read it relatively quickly, but I'm so confused. On the one hand, Antoinette is, of course, descending into madness, but did I have to be high to get hooked into this narrative or something? No character really gets fleshed out or any introspection, the Caribbean setting was described evocatively (that's the one thing I liked about this book) and the post-Abolition time period was seriously historically interesting, but this didn't work for me at all. I had no idea what was going on half the time. A sentence wouldn't make sense, then the sentence following it made no sense either."

 *ACTUALLY 4.5 STARS* 
 I can't think of words to describe how I feel about The Sea of Tranquility. It's terrible and beautiful and heart-breaking. I can't think of any other way to say it, especially since I accidentally deleted my kindle notes...again. 
 I had so much that I wanted to say, and now I'm just regulated to telling you exactly what can be said right off the bat. 
 The writing was truly amazing. It may have been a super long (and at times slow) book, but it really got under my skin and made me think and feel for all of the characters. They're all totally messed up and flawed, but they're truly perfect in every way. I loved every little flaw in each of them. I loved their pain. (Well, I didn't love their pain but you get what I mean.) I loved that they all healed each other in a way. 
 Nastya (I cringe everytime I see that name) really was a broken person. Something very, very bad happened to her, and I spent the first half of the book wondering what it was; then the second half being upset about it. No one should ever go through that. In spite everything she's been through, I respect Nastya. I respect that she wanted people to stare on her terms, and not to feel sorry for her. I respect what she wanted. 
 On another note, I never expected the guy who did it to be so trite. It was crazy, and I actually found myself feeling sorry for him. I can't forgive him, but I'm so sorry for him. That never should have happened. It's his fault, make no mistake, but I feel terrible about it. 
 No one should ever go through what Josh, or Drew, or even Clay is experiencing either. Life isn't easy, but this tiny group of people seem to have it the worst. I wish that I could just wrap them all up in a hug and not let go. They broke my heart so much that I cried multiple times. Not like, flat out bawling on the floor, but a good, this-is-a-fantastic-book cry. 
 All in all, I definitely recommend The Sea of Tranquility. It's a heart-breaking read that just needs to be read."
3,I love Rehv but this story just didn't do it for me. The ending was good and looking forward to the next in the series.
2,"I liked this book, but have to say that while reading it my mind kept wandering and I am not sure why. 
 I liked Maddy, but did think she accepted her new heritage awful easily. I loved how she gave everyone a hard time, it didn't matter who you were. I also loved her relationship with Beezle. I think with her past, he was the one thing she could count on. Even when she was disgusted with him, she still did little things to show she really cared about him. I also really loved the dreams that Maddy got about Evangeline letting her learn some interesting facts. 
 I didn't care much for Gabriel and think the relationship between him and Maddy was too predictable. 
 Right from the start I had some definite thoughts about JB, Maddy's boss. It turns out with the last couple pages my thinking was right. 
 I am looking forward to the next book to see where the events of this book go."
4,"This was the start to a new fantasy series and I was soon caught up in the intrigues. I even wanted to look at the end, but I managed to keep myself in check. 
 Caim is an assassin. Yes he kills for money and he does not have a problem with it. Up until he saves a young woman who thinks he killed her father. Poor Caim is in the middle of a big plot and everyone is gunning for him. What can I say, I have a weak spot for thieves and assassins in fantasy books. And Caim is a good man when it comes down to it. He is driven by revenge and a harsh life. Of course I liked him at once. 
 Other characters are Josey, the daughter of a murdered nobleman and Caim's friend Kit who no one else can see and who hovers around like a ghost. She was a bit of a comedic relief in a way as they bickered. Then we have the bad guys and I will not say more other than the bad guys are really evil. And I want to go and kick some ass. *gives the bad guys the evil eye* 
 Intrigues, I liked that. What was going on? Who wanted who dead? And then when I knew the plot, could Josey and Caim get out of it alive? It came to the point where I no longer could put the book down. 
 It did not end with a cliffhanger but with a nice enough ending and yes with questions. Like the shadows he can command. 
 A good solid start to this series. I will read book 2 and I am very glad that I have book 2 since I want more.

5,"4.5- Loved this book. So good. SO good. The setting/details of the time period were well researched; readers will learn a lot about the scientific beliefs of the time and about alchemy/alchemists in general. Excellent characters, fantastic mystery and code breaking... my only dislike was found in one of the first two chapters where there's too much talk about crotches for my taste. (view spoiler)[ Christopher accidentally shoots a stuffed bear in the crotch, burning the hair off, while the cannon he shot comes back to hit him in the you-know-where. It wasn't completely terrible, I just felt uncomfortable reading it. (hide spoiler)] 
 Notes: no language or romance, quite a bit of gore and violence"
4,"I like Meg Cabot. I haven't read everything she has written, but I have enjoyed the ones I did. Her newest book, Insatiable, is a vampire romance. Since that is one of my favorite genres, I was very excited about it. 
 This book is typical Meg Cabot in that it is a light romance with comical aspects. The main character is Meena Harper which is an obvious play on Mina Harker from the original Dracula. Her brother's name is Jon, so of course, we also have a Jon Harper/Harker. In Dracula, John was Mina's husband. 
 In this story, Meena falls in love with the Prince of Darkness, although there is a possible rival in a vampire slayer named Alaric Wulf. Oh yes, and just to complicate matters, Meena can foresee when people are going to die. Unfortunately, it doesn't work on vampires who are, after all, already dead. 
 I really enjoyed this book, right up until the ending. I would have given it five stars, except the author so obviously set it up for a sequel. I love series, but I want each book to actually have an ending. This one did not end to my satisfaction at all."
3,"So weird, bu very compelling story. All through it I was wondering if this new girl is the same as the one who was lost just with a different body. But no, she is an entirely different person with the attitude and circumstances that the past new girl portrayed. Alas that this new new girl has been judged for what she really is because of her similarities with the previous new girl. I 'd have want a series or a mini-story just to know how the relationship progressed but it would cause me more head and heart aches so that's about it."

 Book #2 of 2012 
 Oh wow! People said that this book was good and addicting and it really was! I finished it in one sitting even though that meant I stayed up way way way past my bedtime. And the world building in this book was also so disturbing. I was wondering, given what the Hunger Games are, how Collins could possibly right a sympathetic hero, but she definitely hit the ball out of the park. 
 Mild spoilers below. 
 It usually really gets on my nerve when there is a heroine who is so very oblivious to the fact that the guy she's with is in love with her. But it worked really well with Katniss and I found myself angry at Peeta, for assuming that she could tell it and getting angry when she thinks its part of the ""game""."
4,that's all
3,"+1 MRK is a delightful human 
 +1 fast-paced, page-turner 
 +1 cool setting 
 -1 hard to follow, felt less than fully-fleshed-out 
 -1 copyediting issues in the final chapters"
2,"I now understand why everyone gets annoyed with first person POV young adult novels. There was no need for the multiple first person POVs in this book. I wish it would have been written in third person because none of the characters' personalities were compelling enough to warrant first person POV. I might have liked it better. 
 I didn't like the romance, it seems forced, even under the circumstances in the book. Looking back, I feel like nothing really happens and the whole book is centered around surviving an alien invasion. I couldn't help but compare it to The Host by Stephenie Meyer (which I liked better). I don't know if it's a good thing to make that comparison, but there it is. This is one book you don't need to read before seeing the movie."
3,"3.5 stars 
 The Star-Touched Queen has once again reminded me that ancient myths and scriptures are the ultimate, infinite source of wisdom and inspiration. And Indian mythology is abundant with unique stories, magical creatures and hidden symbols. Roshani Chokshi has created a rich, exotic retelling overflowing with colorful imagery. While I agree that the writing is overly embellished for a common reader, it never bothered me that much. 
 What I can't left unnoticed is the dramatic shift in the style, paste and the general feel of the story, which happens somewhere at the point of 60% of reading progress. The weird horse-demon Kamala, their quirky dialogues, messy, bumpy narration - although I appreciated the new setting, I found it hard to adapt to the change in writing. The last 10% brought some of the velvety smoothness back, but, unfortunately, not enough to fix the cohesiveness of the story. 
 I found my compensation nonetheless. The Star-Touched Queen conveys the depth and wisdom that fills Indian culture. It is not Bhagavad Gita, of course, but the philosophical concept of perceiving every aspect of life through the viewpoint of eternity is such a refreshing, mind-opening alternative to the usual linear black and white vision. Loved it, was inspired and humbled by it. 
 Looking forward to Roshani Chokshi's next book."
4,Really funny stories about the holidays... definitely an entertaining read!
3,Pretty good. The last story left a bad taste in my mouth though. Haven't we had enough propaganda directed at children about an imminent global disaster for a lifetime?

3,"The spoiler that follows isn't a spoiler. It's the blurb, just in case you haven't read it yet. (view spoiler)[It is the year 2059. Several major world cities are under the control of a security force called Scion. Paige Mahoney works in the criminal underworld of Scion London, part of a secret cell known as the Seven Seals. The work she does is unusual: scouting for information by breaking into others' minds. Paige is a dreamwalker, a rare kind of clairvoyant, and in this world, the voyants commit treason simply by breathing. 
 But when Paige is captured and arrested, she encounters a power more sinister even than Scion. The voyant prison is a separate city--Oxford, erased from the map two centuries ago and now controlled by a powerful, otherworldly race. These creatures, the Rephaim, value the voyants highly--as soldiers in their army. 
 Paige is assigned to a Rephaite keeper, Warden, who will be in charge of her care and training. He is her master. Her natural enemy. But if she wants to regain her freedom, Paige will have to learn something of his mind and his own mysterious motives. (hide spoiler)] 
 Setting 
 Description: Set alternately in London and Oxford, the basic setting was familiar to British-born me, but that was where it ended. The history of the British Isles was rewritten from the reign of Edward VII onwards, and much of the changes aren't fully explained. Clairvoyants comes in all sorts of shapes and sizes - and are reviled by the general population. The protagonist, Paige, is one of these gifted individuals and is caught by the Bone-Season-version of the police. Instead of her expected execution, she is imprisoned in a camp run by Rephaim. The Rephaim are like super-clairvoyants-meet-vampires, and they're ruling England by way of a puppet government, the Scion. 
 Decision: A very complicated world, introduced with a shaky start and some horrific info-dumping, but I was comfortable with it by the end of the book. The world itself is very well developed, and the author seems to know her way around it. The main problem I had with it was that it took too long to become immersed in it and the content was delivered in scattered splurges. There is also an over-abundance of new terminology to learn. It's made easier if you know a little etymology, but plenty of words could have been made clearer with a little less pretentiousness. 
 Rating: 3/5 
 Characters 
 Description: Paige is an Irish immigrant to Scion-controlled London and, like all good heroines, has had a troubled past that led to her becoming the strong, independent individual she is in the novel. She is well-rounded, with some nice flaws that do nothing to get in the way of her character development and still allow her to dispatch any problems with minimal difficulty. 
 Warden (view spoiler)[is Paige's love interest. The romance is a subplot that I guessed at from the blurb, but for the most part it startled me when it was finally realised. It was nice that it took a back seat to the main action-adventure plot, though perhaps a bit too much. (hide spoiler)] is Paige's Rephaim keeper. Unlike most Rephaim, he is neither cruel nor abusive, and he seems to treat humans with some degree of respect. He is mysterious and has some odd habits, and is training Paige for her place in the prison-society known as Sheol 1. As an aside, sheol is the old-testament term for the world where the dead reside, and rephaim are the emotionless spirits who abide there. Fun fact. 
 The antagonist is mainly the ruler of the Rephaim, and by default Sheol 1. I can't remember her name. Most of the names got strange outside of the core cast. Never fear, I shall look it up. Nashira. There you go. 
 The supporting cast is made up of numbered characters (literally. They have numbers instead of names, not just like in a credit list: Waiter 1, Electrician 2 etc) and only a few are given the grand distinction of names. 
 Decision: Paige is very conveniently built, but still likeable. She's not a Mary-Sue, though her flaws do nothing to hinder the plot and only serve to drag out her personal problems. I can think of no instance where she made a mistake, or even a decision that affected the outcome of the plot other than 'I choose to live now instead of die,' but hey, let's call that luck and move on. 
 Since the entire book is from Paige's point of view, Warden isn't given a lot of emotional depth until the final third of the book. I fail to see any reason why he (view spoiler)[falls for Paige (hide spoiler)] but he does, so kudos to him. His backstory is well thought out and almost plausible but for one thing: (view spoiler)[why, after the rebellion of one of the bone seasons, was he not executed? The first time, he was allowed to live for no given reason, and the second time, though he is more important then, he is instantly sentenced to death. Please, show me the logic. (hide spoiler)] 
 The villain of the piece was unfortunately typical. No redeeming qualities, no relevant back story. She was someone who was hated solely because she was the villain. She was given no motivations for her actions that I could see - or maybe Paige saw her that way and so that's all we see of her. 
 As for the supporting cast, the habit of giving them numbers instead of names goes a long way towards making them invisible. If that was the intention, bravo! Whether named or not, they are all expendable. Either foils or cannon fodder, the named ones still manage to have distinct personalities - though you have to wonder if all of them are strictly necessary. 
 Everyone seemed like vessels for setting and plot, victims of circumstance rather than their own decisions. 
 Rating: 3/5. Though I enjoyed them well enough until I really thought about them for this review, so if you're less pernickety than me, give them a boost to 4/5. 
 Plot 
 Description: Take a look at the blurb for a non-spoilered summary. 
 Decision: I enjoyed the plot. After the first couple of chapters, when I had disagreements with the characters and style and... well, most of it, it was what kept me going. It was a bit formulaic, but the formulae are there for a reason and there were some decent subplots to keep this going. No startling plot twists and a few scenes which had only the vaguest hint of a purpose. My main problem was that before the final action scene there was a big time skip. 
 Rating: 4/5 
 Style 
 Description: Hrr... can you really describe a style in a way that doesn't convey your decision? This is my first review. I'll refine the layout for the next one, bear with me. 
 Decision: The book starts out a bit blandly. Shannon seems to be so intent on building her world that the scenes themselves are slightly neglected. Info-dumping, I think it's called, and it was so dense at the beginning that I had to fight to stay interested. Sentences were very repetitive, as was scene order. Some parts seemed overly simplistic, but then certain words jumped out at me, a jarring attempt of the author to display her vocabulary. Not that we don't all do it (and by we all I mean I), I just think that a published author should be held to a higher standard. 
 Rating: 2.5/5 I'd give it lower, but it didn't put me off the book entirely. 2 seems to me a bit mean for something that didn't totally repulse me."
4,"Well, that was an interesting take on Peter Pan and Neverland. 
 Not much I can say without spoiling details. Though I will mention Peter is trans, and Neverland allows him to inhabit a male body. Peter and Hook have explosive chemistry, and when Hook ultimately finds out Peter is trans, he makes zero fuss about it. 
 Side note: Hook's voice. Oh my god. I love it. I am thoroughly endeared to him and his ostentatious way of speaking. It's unfortunate that Disney ruined his sex appeal in my mind. I just had to imagine this pic over and over again until Hook became the Romance lead that he is:"

3,"Brashares seems to falter a step when diverting from her Sisterhood series. While her other books are lively, engaging and filled with the most 'real' girls I have read in a long time, the characters in this novel were a mystery to me. Distant, unsympathetic and overall lacking emotional pull. The plot felt lackluster and poor conceived or thought-out. The final climax fell flat and unremarkable. 
 I had expected much more from an author whose previous works I couldn't love more, or reread more often. Perhaps it was the subject matter, or perhaps I'm too tied to a more jovial-tone series of hers, but I can't help but wish I'd enjoyed this more. 
 More of my reviews here: http://bibliophileanonymous.blogspot...."
3,"I received an ARC of this novel at BEA in New York from the publisher. 
 I have not read the author's previous work, On the Island, but the cover really grabbed my attention and that is primarily why I accepted the copy. 
 This is not a typical read for me. I am not a fan of ""infidelity is something that just happens"" kind of stories. But there is really nothing typical about this book. The author is a very talented writer. The characters are drawn so sympathetically that the reader is drawn into their lives. These are characters that under other circumstances or in a less talented author's hands might just be seen as another group of overprivileged whiners. 
 I particularly am impressed with the author's ability to convey the stresses and strains on a marriage that come with the loss of a job and financial hardship. The treatment of emotional infidelity, feelings of abandonment, and depression are all sensitively handled. Chris, Clare and Daniel are all given voice in this book. I will say that, for me, the sections about Chris and Clare and their marriage were much stronger than Daniel's voice in the book. 
 This is not an easy book to read, especially if you have dealt with any of the myriad of issues explored on the pages of this book. For fans of women's fiction that deals with contemporary real life issues, this is definitely a worthwhile."
3,This is a super sweet romance between best friends. One guy has only been with women. One has never been with anyone. They're learning and figuring each other and themselves out as they go.
4,"Another beautiful and heartbreaking book by Lisa Schroeder. 
 Review in Swedish at Boktycke."
5,"Although, it never actually says where or when this book takes place other than in Near in my minds eye I see colonial America throughout the description. I wasn't actually expecting a historical when I opened this book, but I was pleasantly surprised. It has rich descriptions of the surroundings and how life is ran within the village of Near. 
 The book opens up to a pleasant little scene between Lexi and her little sister, Wren. We get a wealth of information within a few words, but it never seems overwhelming. We see Lexi's love for her sister, how the death of her beloved father has impacted the family, the spooky tale of the heritage of the village Near, and the strength that has been cultivated within Lexi. She is a remarkable girl with a kind heart. 
 At times the story is so eerie that my heart beats faster and other it lies silent hoping all will be well. Honestly, I am like the biggest scardey-cat and it had me a bit on edge. 
 But at the heart of this story is a message that fear of that which is unknown can bring about real dangers including loosing your own morality. I will likely read this book again and again as it was one of the best books I've read in a long while."
1,"Oh my gosh... 
 This book... 
 Killed me =___= 
 I thought the idea of being a ""catcher"" like catching other peoples dreams, was interesting and like ""you don't see that much"" but I am left with so many questions but mostly my ""why""'s. Like ""why"" did she do that and this and then said that and NOT asked about this and ""whyyyyyy???"" is Lisa McMann going to write this and not explain it so it's just hanging there like a bruise that festers up without any explanation and will not go away. 
 It's not that I totally hated this book, it's just I wish that the characters weren't explained so blandly and I wish the plot flowed better than being set up basically like a journal or something. like

 It's a fast and easy read, I read it in about an hour, but... to expect much (I hate that I'm being a butthead about this book) would only lead to disappointment. 
 P.S to some extent I do want to read the next books in the series just because I hate when I don't finish a series or a book but I'm deciding that I'll read it way way in the future so I may be old and wise enough to discover that the books really were great but I was just too young for it's greatness :I I can only hope"
0,"Like Legend, Prodigy's story alternates from June and Day's points of view, with June's in black text and Day's in blue. Usually in dual POV stories I prefer one point of view, and this time it was June's. I'm not sure if that was because I found Day's typeface a little harder on the eyes, or because his storyline dealt mostly with his medical problems, Patriot tactical strategy and arguing with Tess, a girl he grew up with, about why he shouldn't trust June. 
 Middle books in trilogies often either separate a couple or create circumstances in which their love is tested, and Prodigy is no exception, using the latter to great effect. I'd forgotten how ridiculously young these two are and what a short time they've known each other. At one point, Tess says to Day, ""You think you're in love with a girl you've known for less than a month?"" 
 June -- as the blurb indicates -- gets assigned to assassinate someone. She also throws knives, takes lie detector tests, plays dress-up, and generally does all this great Mata Hari stuff, which was a lot of fun. Needless to say, I loved her chapters. 
 Some people have said that a love rectangle develops in Prodigy, but I can't quite agree...."
5,"** spoiler alert ** 
 Anderson created a haunting world that left me feeling very disturbed, but in a good way. The way she wrote it, the things Lia thought and said gave more depth to the character that otherwise would not have been there. I loved how she 'struck out' words to show how she wasn't comfortable with things or was afraid to admit things. After she stole her grandmother's knife and attempted suicide, the blank pages after were an amazing addition and really made me pause for a moment, thinking - did she really? She didn't have it end in a cookie-cutter happy way, either, which made it very realistic, as I'm sure she was going for anyway."
3,"This book was majorly hyped. Before I even received the list of books to read for this course, it was already on my to be read list. Some of my favorite book reviewer's absolutely gushed about this book and gave it superb ratings and needless to say because of this I was both anticipating this read and fearing it. Hyped books can be either be an amazing read or a letdown if they aren't as good as you assumed they would be, and unfortunately Wonder falls into the latter category. This is not to say that I didn't enjoy Wonder, because I did and I would recommend it to friends and keep it in my classroom. I just don't anticipate a reread anytime in the future. 3.5 
 (view spoiler)[Palacio does a wonderful job at evoking the reader's emotions. I felt for August in so many ways. I felt his worry of going to a public school for the first time, dealing with a bully who was great at schmoozing over the adults around him while terrorizing his fellow peers, and his agony when he heard a supposed friend talking negatively about him with the same person whom was out to ruin his life. That one felt like a punch in the gut, especially since I had been a similar situation before in my own life. I sympathized with August's parents emotional turmoil over fearing for his physical and emotional safety in public school, Olivia's understanding of why her parents focused so much on August but her want for them to just notice her, Jack's dealings with peer pressure, and Miranda's thoughts on drifting apart from friends. None of it felt forced. None of it seemed out of character or unrealistic. I get weary when books use multiple points-of-view because a lot of the time, the character's sound all the same and the author doesn't really know how to differentiate them from one another. This was not the case with Wonder, and I was surprised at how Palacio was able to get each individual's character's voice heard and show how they all think through things and talk in their own mind differently. I will say that reading Justin's perspective was kind of rough, but I appreciated the intent behind making his perspective told without proper punctuation. 
 There are two characters that stick out to me the most, besides Auggie. Via and Julian. Auggie is still important, being the focal character of the story, but these three characters either really resonated with me or were incredibly complex or gave me hope to be like them. Auggie himself is rather interesting and courageous. He's a lot smarter than this family thinks of him in the beginning, and a lot stronger too. It's easy to say that he is this way because he was born with it so he has to be but to me it takes strength to have this sort of self confidence and self worth to take such risks to do things he really wants to do while he knows the risks, like go to a public school. However although he can put on a brave face for the most part he has a breaking point just like everyone else. There were also a couple of things that really infuriated me about Auggie. At times I found him to be a bit selfish, especially in situations with Via. As Via puts it in her own chapters, ""August is the Sun"" at home. There's reason enough for this to be so, but Auggie never really seemed to understand that Via wanted her parents too. Instead of asking Via, he just assumed she was also embarrassed by him and that basically everything in her world had to do with him. I also found him a bit hypocritical- mocking Justin when he left the room with Via. He feels so much agony when he hears comments about him, but he can freely mock Justin? Although these things infuriated me, I really enjoyed that they were in the book and that August wasn't some total saint and could do no wrong. 
 Via and I connected because at times in my life, as the middle child, I felt like my parents cared more about my younger and older siblings. I understood why they focused on them, my older brother going through things earlier than me and my younger sister being the baby of the family, but I just wanted them to emphasize some parts of their day towards me. Via was the same. She understood why Auggie needed so much attention but she desperately wanted something that was just hers. This was the relationship she formed with her Grandmother. She originally didn't want Auggie to come to her play not because she was embarrassed but that she knew there was a risk of him taking up the limelight in a sense- even if it was in a negative way. I think she should have been a little more sympathetic towards Auggie at times, as he could not control what others did, but I understood why she behaved the way that she did. I admired her outspokenness about her support of Auggie when they were younger and her ability to see through people's disabilities or handicaps like Justin's. 
 Julian is written in the story as a bit one-dimensional but to me, I read him more complexly. I understood why Palacio did not have him as one of the perspectives to the story and never really showed him in another light for the purpose of the story, but I didn't like the fact that he was written as a set ""baddie"". No person is one-hundred percent good or evil and everyone has motivations for their actions. To me, it was pretty evident that Julian acted this way because his parents allowed him to. Reading this novel I knew that something had to be going on in his home life (although I was rather disappointed about the actual explanation in Julian's Chapter, but I will focus my thoughts on what I thought of him while just reading Wonder). Julian's actions are so cruel and malicious that I was shocked at times by what he was saying. His ability to schmooze adults and get others on his side was so utterly maddening. But this is what fear does to you. August is different. When you're 10 years old you're learning it's time you conform to society and Auggie's differences are so apparent it probably scared Julian. And when Jack, Julian's friend, suddenly starts to buddy up with him it can be seen that he got jealous and decided to throw it back on them. To me there never really was a full conclusion with this character in Wonder, but his wasn't his story. It was Auggie's. 
 I felt that the bullying aspect of the story was written realistically. It starts out with Julian just asking super unfriendly comments- probably due to his fears of August. Gradually the comments get more and more cruel and noticeable to his peers and adults around him. Jack giving in to peer pressure and talking poorly of August with Julian makes a lot of sense, especially for Jack's character. August's reaction to Jack's comments were also very realistic and in my opinion, pretty mature. Could he have asked Jack about the situation himself right after? Sure, but It seems pretty unreasonable to me when he's had to deal with this type of thing with his whole life and when he finally believes he's found a friend he is betrayed. It was in August's best interest to cut him out completely, until Jack apologizes and punches Julian of course. Jack punching Julian was something I was not expecting at first but after learning more back story of his and Julian's relationship in the past, with the sled for example, it makes perfect sense as to why he would finally break down. The fallout of that incident of the class being split into ""sides"" reminds me so much of what it was like in my 5th and 6th grade classes. Everyone was super cliquey and everything meant so much to everyone as all our emotions were so high. Reading about this ""war"" going on between the three of them (August, Jack, and Julian) honestly made me chuckle at how it all felt for me personally when I was their age. I feel like those who read this book at their age will be able to resonate with the whole scenario very well, and hopefully this book will allow them to see how trivial it really is. 
 Because this novel is extremely character-based, I didn't really feel like there was a set plot. It was about Auggie's first year in a public school sure, but it felt like a roller coaster of a story with no true climax. This made the story a bit weak to me although I enjoyed the characters. Some would say that it was a story about Auggie vs. Julian, but to me it wasn't like that either. There was no clear ""winner"" in the end because there wasn't any. Julian left school and Auggie never not an apology, although not necessary and a good tale to students that people may never understand why what they did was wrong, something important to really make it a certain ending. I don't think Palacio really knew how to deal with ending conflict. Via and Auggie's argument over the play could have been this big turning point for them but instead it was brushed aside by their dog's death and never really spoken of again. Justin's perspective in the story would be last on my list of ranking the perspectives. I felt it totally unnecessary except for maybe brief characterization of Via and for the ice cream scene of him going up to Julian and his friends. To be honest, I also hated the fact that it felt like everyone in the book got a happy ending besides the main protagonist. It just felt a bit to sunny and Hollywood movie-ending like to me. It's all fine and dandy, you graduated fifth grade (which does that even happen anywhere?) but next year you're all just going to face more problems. Maybe I'm being too much of a pessimist, but it just felt too picture perfect. This is a book that has to do with bullying and unfortunately in our society, most of these cases don't end well. I don't want a book to be written purely to teach a certain age group about the effects of bullying and how everything gets to be all fine and dandy in the end. I want books to tell a story and get the message across plain and simple. To me, having everything end in such a Hollywood manner takes away from all the emotional turmoil August and others went through in the book. 
 Overall, I still found Wonder to be a good read and I don't regret reading it but the hype was just a bit too much and I feel as if the author played too much on the reader's emotions and not enough on the actual storyline. I read it in one sitting and quickly read The Julian Chapter soon after. As mentioned before, Palacio made each character's perspective so different and inviting that even though I found myself bummed out that one character's perspective was over but then finished the next one feeling the same way (excluding Justin). The character's all inspired me in different ways, especially when August quickly tells his mother that Justin is the ""nice to adults but not nice to peers"" kind of a kid- normally that part is drawn out into the story for so long and I was glad it got nipped in the butt so quickly. I think that young readers will be able to take away that you should not judge a person based on looks and that you really shouldn't keep things bottled up inside for so long. Although unfortunately, these are two things that I believe that no matter how much you tell people they won't really get it until certain situations happen to themselves. (hide spoiler)] 
 ***great wall of text behind the cut b/c this was actually a review i did for school. mAJOR spoilers.***"
5,"AMAZING this book is definitely a keeper. Sam is awkward and gangally but just looking for ""The One"" who is a highlander in a (Kilt) who comes running after him after sam gets thrown to the floor by a rugby ball. this romance is uncertain and unstable for most of the book but becomes adorable as Ian (the highlander) begins to realise how amazing Sam really is. an amazing read and would definitely recommend it if you want something that will keep you smiling all day when you think about it."
5,"LOVE! Haven't seen the tv show so I don't know how it compares to that, but if it's anything like the book, and I've heard it is, it should be amazing too."
3,"I'm seeing a definite theme for this series emerging: (1) cop gets put on high profile case, (2) cop suspects someone obvious, (3) cop is told to take some time to herself during said high profile case, (4) cop finds out suspect not so suspect after all and someone else emerges, (5) cop surprised when actual killer tries to kill her, and (6) cop's man comes in to save the day while the cop is semi-handling it. 
 Admittedly, I didn't think this wasn't the best book in this series. For one, I thought on that list long and hard as I was working through the book. And I worked through this book up until the end. Might have been because I'm busy, but I admittedly wasn't desperate to return to the story after putting it down. Still, I always love Eve and Roarke as a couple, and this series in general has been a good one so far."
4,"This was beautiful and heartwarming story ... indeed touching and sweet 
 My first patterson novel but well i think i liked it"
5,"4.5 Stars. 
 Well, this series certainly got more interesting. 
 I did not see that ending coming! 
 At all! 
 And what will happen to Dorian? Will he ever have an awesome love interest other than Celaena? 
 And Nehemia!!!! 
 *Sigh* The feels, man. THE FEELS!! 
 Can't wait to read the next one! :D"
3,"I liked this, I found it slow going at first but picked up really fast towards the end. There was more swearing in this than I'd like in a YA and it almost turned me off from the book. But after a while I stopped noticing it and started to really get into the story. 
 I liked the idea behind this, the entity. It was a refreshing change to most origin stories we are used to (Cane, Vlad, etc) and I really thought it was an interesting storyline once we finally are clued into exactly the curse that is presented. 
 I liked Ari, she's a tougher chick than you find in most YA novels. She's not a damsel in distress or clingy. But the character I really liked the most was Violet. Loved this girl! I'm looking forward to the next novel in the series! It should be a promising one!"
5,"I cried. Oh God. I think I have an Augustus Waters fetish myself. 
 I fell in love with Augustus. With ""OKAY"" that is bursting with sensuality. With tulips. With An Imperial Affliction. With the talking about oblivion. With all the good quotes. With every single freaking detail. I fell in love with the book. 
 Oh my God. My life would never be the same. Thank you John Green for this. I love you forever."
3,"So I thought there was gonna be a subtle fantasy element to this, for some reason... Not sure why. It just felt that way. But there wasn't. Which is probably no reason to judge it harshly. It's not the book's fault I thought it was going to be something else. Is it? 
 Anyway, I didn't love this. I found it a bit too maudlin, and I struggled to care about any of it. I mean it's a perfectly fine YA book, just... not for me. Not right now."
3,"Me and NOS4A2 have not had the best of relationships. I will take some of the blame -- I usually switch back and forth between genres -- a kind of palette cleanse. But this time I went right from UNDER THE DOME to another book with bad people and suspense. 
 I never found myself invested in this book. I didn't have that *need* to know what happened next. When I put the book down, I wasn't sad about leaving it. There a few moments along the way where I thought it would change, but it didn't. 
 Maybe it was the characters? I didn't connect with any of them, but I have a serious respect for Vic McQueen. She's definitely a badass mom. I also appreciated the role of the librarian -- any book with a librarian will get my attention. But I didn't understand the path Maggie Leigh went down. Now the bad guys...well...I had Charlie Manx & Bing filled nightmares so that limited my reading considerably. No bedtime reading after two nights with those guys. 
 The one thing that DROVE ME CRAZY about this book: the hanging chapters (is that what they're called?). The first time I've ever noticed this trend(?) was, strangely enough, in UNDER THE DOME. It was maybe one chapter and I thought my ebook was faulty. Then I start reading this one and it was half the chapters. Hated it! 
 So lots of things I didn't really like about this book, but I still found it worth reading. I mean, I finished it and that's saying something. Plus, I liked the last chapter and again...Vic is a badass. (Plus the acknowledgments were great.) 
 Bottom line - it's good to read outside your comfort zone on occasion but it doesn't mean you'll love everything you read."
5,"Check out my review blog at http://reviewsfromabookworm.blogspot..... 
 Maya and Lochan have always seemed much more than brother and sister. After their father left five years earlier and their mother began drinking, they have taken on the parental roles and responsibilities. They depend on each other, rely on each other and need each other to ensure that the family is kept together, that Social Services do not realise that their mother is absent. Lochan's life is being controlled by his crippling social anxiety and panic attacks, he can't connect to anyone but his family, can't look people in the eye or speak to them. Maya notices Lochan's struggles and wishes she could help but she hopes it's something he will get over in time, as a straight A student he is headed towards great things.They need each other but as their relationship begins to develop beyond that of brother and sister they know what they are doing is wrong. But they can't stop themselves from loving each other. 
 I know, I know; you're probably thinking 'Incest, ewwww!'. But please, please, please, please, please do not let that put you off this book. I also had a lot of reservations but I had seen such unbelievably amazing reviews for this book that I put that aside and reserved a copy at work. By the time it arrived I had to read it, had to know what about this book could make people fall so in love with it despite the taboo subject it covers. And now I know. 
 ""At what point do you give up - decide enough is enough? There is only one answer really. Never."" 
 I guess I feel like I should note that I don't have any brothers, I don't know if this would have been harder to read if I had. I was intrigued to know if anyone with brothers had still read and enjoyed this book and yes I found people who loved and adored this just as much as I did. After completing this book, I immediately went online and bought my own copy. This was a new favourite and it was going on my 'Pride of Place' shelf on my bedroom bookcase. 
 This book had me, it just had me from the word go and it would not let me go. It had me absolutely sobbing, it had me so angry, shocked and hurt that I wanted to throw it across my room. But I couldn't hate this book, I loved this book and nothing it did to upset me seemed to change that. I loved it more because it upset me, because it made me feel so much, it made me care so much. Lochan and Maya will always have a special place in my heart, I don't think I will ever forget this book. 
 ""You can close your eyes to the things you do not want to see, but you cannot close your heart to the things you do not want to feel."" 
 This book is not about incest, it isn't proclaiming that we should all go and fall in love with our siblings. . This book is about how hard it is to control who you fall in love with. I mean, the oldest saying is you can't help who you fall in love with. Knowing that what your doing is wrong doesn't make it any easier to stop, emotions aren't taps that you can switch off at will. 
 In a world that seems obsessed with forbidden love stories this one is my favourite. We've had Romeo & Juliet of duelling houses, Bella & Edward vampire meets human, and even City of Bones suggested an incestuous relationship for quite a while and everyone seems to love that. So please, I beg you to give this a try. If you need anymore convincing just check out some of the other 3,027 5 star reviews on Goodreads! 
 I don't even know what to write in this review, all I know is that I would urge anyone to give it a try. Then if you absolutely hated it, I would absolutely love to know why, discuss it. I think it's one of those books that could lead to some amazing discussions. 
 5/5 Stars"
4,"I think this was the first Sherrilyn Kenyon book I ever read-talk about jumping right in to the Dark Hunter world. I love the Dark Hunters and this is a fun one. Anyone who loves the DH series will love it, and PNR romance lovers will love it. I strongly recommend reading them in order (I did not-it sucked). 
 Susan rescues a cat who is really a dark hunter. He turns from cat to leopard to man in front of her, and she's calm about it-I loved that. She didn't scream or go all girly and faint. Girls who faint make me stabby (which is ironic since I would probably faint). It was a fun book to re-read now that I've read through the series, and know the characters and the world better. 
 I think that one of my favorite quotes ever came from this book: 
 ""So tell me something, how did you do that earlier trick?"" 
 Ravyn grimaced. ""What trick?"" 
 ""The cat thing. How did you switch?"" 
 Why did humans always want that question answered? Even if he explained it, it wasn't like they 
 could do it. ""It's magick,"" he said sarcastically. ""I mumble hocus-pocus and the next thing you 
 know, I'm a cat."" 
 She narrowed her eyes at him. ""I suppose it's a step up. The last guy I had in my house could 
 only turn into a beer-drinking Pig."" 
 In spite of himself, he gave a short laugh at her dry tone. He had to give her credit, she had a 
 quick sense of humor, and he was quirky enough to appreciate that in other people."""
3,Lovely story.
5,"Loved it. It was sweet, funny, touching. The narrator was not even Remotely like a real 13 year old boy, at least not like any I've met, but living with my own 13 year old boy is plenty of reality for me and I'm more than happy to read about this fantasy boy who is thoughtful, compassionate, and brilliantly successful at every new activity he turns a hand to. Very enjoyable."
5,Brilliant children's book that tells the story simply through illustrations. It assumes the child is smart enough to get the point without having to be spoon-fed. Definitely calls up some complicated and amusing social situations that any child will learn. Uses great irony and blunt comedic situations to entertain all the way through.
3,A book about empathy in the eyes of someone who is not capable of it.
3,"Actual rating - 2.75 
 The characters in this were alright, But I didn't love them. 
 I found this one hard to get into, so I felt quite bored for a lot of it unfortunately. 
 I don't think I'll be bothering with the rest of the series."
4,3.5 to 4 stars. Lots of angst in this one.
4,"Halfway to the Grave is my first full-on paranormal romance and I really, really enjoyed it! It was in first person POV, which is not something I usually like in romances, but here it works and didn't bother me too much. I feel like we're told enough about what Bones is feeling through her observations, that he's not closed off or inaccessible by any means. In fact, Bones is one of the most delicious heroes ever!! Though at first I was always torn between picturing Emily Deschanel or walking skeleton - got over that quickly enough though ;-). 
 I'm always a fan of the loner / wallflower / unusual heroines, no matter the romance genre, so Cat delivered on that score. I found her honesty and insecurity refreshing, while also liking the fact that she was open and honest with Bones and that any issues that arose were not turned into Big Misunderstandings or Things Left Unsaid - plot ploys that I hate. 
 I will say that the ending was ... argh! So not satisfactory. I knew beforehand that this was a series and having read the summary of the next book to come out, knew how far their relationship will get. However I was not expecting the ending to be done as it was and to hear that the next book takes place 4 years later really brought down my excitement. (view spoiler)[Bones promised to chase her no matter where she went - 4 years is way too long for that IMO!!! I also read in other people's reviews that Tate hits on her and she considers dating again, which really, really turned me off. She's supposed to be heartbroken and so is Bones! Hello!! (hide spoiler)] Honestly, I'm debating whether to change my rating from a 4.5 to 4 just because of this ending and my frustration with what Frost does with Bones and Cat leading up to - and at the beginning of - the next book. (Note: ended up lowering to 4 stars) 
 Overall the book was wonderful - romantic, funny, and an entertaining plot. I loved Bones and how he acted towards Cat, the things he said to her, etc. So, so sweet. The only thing marring this wonderful reading experience was how it ends and knowing what that leads to. Really put a damper on things, but still a great read and I am definitely buying my own copy of this book!"
0,"Heard so much buzz about this book and how I'd not be able to put it down. Got 67 pages in, was never quite hooked, got bored and never picked it up again. This was the beginning of a really weird reading slump, where I'm not happy with anything I'm reading."
1,"DNF - I think I ended up just over halfway when I threw in the towel. Ugh! Anyone expecting a well-developed story will be horribly disappointed. 
 It was disappointing as the theme is unique and interesting with a girl determined to save her friend and embarks on a rescue mission into hell, kinda cool right? 
 Probably the biggest issue I had with this book was the whole reason for Lela going into hell to rescue her friend. (view spoiler)[Lela felt as though she owed Nadia, as her friend believed in her and gave her reason again. I found this totally flawed - as yes, Nadia made her start to believe in herself and got her accepted into college but Nadia was then also the reason that she died at the age of 18, just when she had started to have a promising future - it just didn't make any sense to me. (hide spoiler)] 
 For someone who should be a major character or at least very likeable at the start of the book to give you some reasoning behind everything Lela is doing, Nadia pretty much just spends the entire book being an empty shell of a girl, I get why (kind of), but it was hard to care about her at all. Her character needed some serious development! 
 Then there's Malachi, a fierce, brutal, driven Captain of the Guard, however, after a conversation with Lela he suddenly loves her and is willing to sacrifice anything for her... hmm yeah, that's total believable. 
 This book had so much potential but failed miserably at every important aspect of the story. Anybody looking for something more than just an insta-love romance will most likely be disappointed."
4,"And now for something a little different to treat us happy members of the Cabal Cabal - a story largely narrated not by the great necromancer Johannes, but by his slimy, disgustingly vampiric brother, Horst. Most of the time, we get to hear Horst's tale, with Johannes (on his sickbed) interjecting with interludes and footnotes along the way. We're getting a little more Fforde-like with this book, which expertly blends elements and plot points from all three of its predecessors in surprising ways as it merrily leads the reader on another gleeful danse macabre. 
 Despite the exceedingly rude messages left at the end of this book - particularly around its Nice Epilogue and Nasty Epilogue - I'm game for another Cabal misadventure, whenever that'll come along."
4,"3.5- Not as good as the first, but still a delight."
3,"I have mixed opinions regarding this book. The writing is very crisp and sharp and didn't immediately draw me in. The appeal, I have to say, is largely in the dry, biting, and sharp humour. But there are other problems. For one, the plot seems pretty extraneous considering you never have any idea what's happening, which should be fine in a detective fiction, and could even be an essential element of it, but it takes a whole another shape in this book, one that I did not like. The other part that I did not like was, as has been pointed by many, many people, the protagonist, the bigoted Philip Marlowe, who thinks women can get used to being slapped around, and who is contemptuous towards every woman he comes across. What I did like about this book is that in my opinion it would make a great film noir (I still have to watch the 1946 adaptation of it, and I desperately hope that Humphrey Bogart's Marlowe doesn't sound so bigoted, but I'm pretty certain I would like it if not for any other reason than the fact that it has Humphrey Bogart). Is that reason enough to like this book? I don't know. So I'll stick to giving it 3 stars for now."
3,"Super quick but super interesting and unique. Loved the voice and just loved it in general. However, did feel that it played on stereotypes a little."
3,I don't get my hands on a lot of hunourous fiction (I'm not really sure why) but this one provided a good few chuckles. I just found it a bit too long - it could have maybe been a few chapters shorter.
4,I liked this a lot!
1,"Bingo - that I saw everyone else reading (well, except for people I know in real life!) I plan to share my thoughts (and a few links to others whose thoughts were eloquently expressed in print or voice) shortly. for now, I only want to record that I've read the book. and I'm not sorry I did. 
 Wow - it's now August 4, 2015 - and the book is rated 3.55 stars here on Goodreads. SERIOUSLY??!! I'd like to keep my rating at zero stars, but I'm guessing Goodreads won't count that for the average, so I'm setting it at one. I wrote a blog post today to share a few of my thoughts about the book (and those links I promised above). http://mere-et-filles.blogspot.com/20..."
3,"I've been delaying writing a review on this one, which I finished a week ago, because I'm quite conflicted about it. It was a recognizably flawed book, but I loved reading it. The characters' motivations were not just obscure, they were inexplicable and mostly just absent. Despite that, I loved the characters--especially Edgar, with whom I was so invested, so quickly, that I often had to put the book down after a segment just to catch my breath and brace myself for what might be next. The story itself seemed to set off promising some definitive journey-to-an-end, and never got there unless you think that Wroblewski really did pull off a Shakespearean tragedy--which I definitely don't. (Shakespeare was a master at tying up all his plot points neatly, answering all the unanswered questions and making each of his characters' motivations crystal clear by the last line of the last act, wasn't he?) 
 Ok ... so why did this book that so clearly didn't live up to what it could have been--a grand, allegorical Shakespearean coming-of-age story with a tragic ending--still capture my attention and hold my interest so completely instead of disappointing me thoroughly? It broke all kinds of rules, and not deliberately and provocatively by putting others in their place, as I kind of thought it would when it took its first turn into magic realism, but through what I can only see as B-grade writing. E.g., the ghost in the rain, and later in the toolshed? That was Wroblewski's delusions of Shakespearean grandeur that got him into that trouble, but he didn't create a phantasmagorical story around it, with characters and events that transcended the real-life laws of physics, or with human motivations and plots that were epic in proportion. Edgar's trial-by-fire journey into the wilderness was more like a really bad camping trip. The Sawtelle dogs weren't bound to their masters in some kind of canine-human bond that was the next step on the evolutionary ladder, they were just exceptionally friendly and clever. 
 Yet, this damn thing is like the bumblebee that defies the laws of physics to fly--I still think it was a sweeping saga, a masterful story that illustrates some pretty timeless themes of emotional connection, family, and human-animal bonds. 
 And I'm trying to be ruthless with myself here, because I confess to an annoying predilection to get sucked into sentimentality and overlook structural flaws, especially when there are dogs involved. I myself own a Wheaten terrier, Molly, of whom one woman I meet up with in the dog park remarked: ""that dog is so devoted to you, if you died, she will lie down on your grave and wait for death to take her."" 
 I loved the Sawtelle dogs, I truly did. But this is just it: Wroblewski set me up for what I thought would be an original, compelling idea (with the dogs, and in other places too) and then ... didn't quite take me there. 
 He just didn't push any of the plots far enough, he didn't make any of the characters tragic enough, or any of the events emotionally wrenching enough. This made it easier to read than it should have been--although I was prepared for tragedy, my fear of what might happen was worse than what eventually did. It makes for great suspense, but a less-than-satisfying experience in some ways. 
 Ironically enough, had he made the highs higher and the lows lower, I wouldn't have been able to read it but I would have thought it was a better novel. It would have been too emotionally wrenching for me, because as it was I was bonded to Edgar and Almondine; I related to their deep and complex emotional inner lives, and mute inability--literally--to express themselves. I felt Edgar's angst--his isolation, his adolescent pain, his yearning to find his way in the world and through the tragic events that befell him. I felt Almondine--and later other dogs'--deep connection to each other and to their humans; Wroblewski did quite a good job capturing that unique attachment between dogs and people and expressing it from the animal's point of view (not as good as Gowdy in The White Bone, but still a commendable effort). 
 *** SPOILER ALERT *** 
 But Wroblewski didn't take Edgar or the dogs close enough to death to make their harrowing journey (either its cause or its consequences) so powerful that it was both transformative and tragic. In fact, he gave them an 'out' in Henry and his generosity that dampened the pain (psychological and, in Timber's case, physical) and dulled the conclusion. He didn't show us Almondine's death in gruesome, gut-wrenching enough detail to make the reader feel as though she had been ripped from this life and our hearts, or from Edgar's--so her 'reappearance' was anti-climactic and kind of comforting, when it should have been otherworldly and triumphal. He didn't clearly explain Claude's background to show us the depths of his depravity and cruelty--he implied a bunch of nasty details related to dog-fighting, but not enough to let us in on the fact that this man was an evil-doer. Instead, he seemed to be a ne'er-do-well black-sheep relative, ambiguously and somewhat ineptly criminal but not the instrument of death and destruction that in fact he was. 
 You see what I mean? 
 And yet ... and yet. I really enjoyed this book. I enjoyed it despite of or perhaps because of the fact that it didn't rip my heart out, and serve it up to me on a platter, reading late into the night with tears streaming down my face. That is what it probably should have done, but I forgive it and thank it for being gentle. I wonder if a second reading would do that for me--I would be less focused on what I thought was going to happen, and more able to experience what was happening in the moment. Hmmm. 
 Overall, I think that while Wroblewski over-reached with the Shakespearean allusion(s), what he did do was solid and satisfying, quite original and engrossing, despite its flaws. My always-by-my-side Wheaten terrier Molly and I give it 4.253.25 [ETA: 7/8/10 what was I thinking?] stars. :-)"
4,"Great sequel. The plot definitely picks up, new characters are well integrated and add a fresh dynamic, and the characters still remain very nuanced despite all the shit blowing up in their faces. 
 However, Ruby's selfhatred is possibly even more grating here, especially when she comforts other characters over their guilt and gives advise that completely contradicts how she deals with her own guilt. 
 Hopefully character development kicks in for the last book and she'll get over that bullshit and realize how great she is and learn to love herself and positively accept her powers cause damn girl. 
 It is so very frustrating to read about a character like that (especially in first person) without any significant, positive character growth to balance out that negativity."
4,"While I was reading it I kept thinking, ""Yeah, this is pretty good, guess I'll keep going,"" and then I realized it was over. This is an enormously fun entertaining read. For me, it was also an introduction to the Dominican Republic and Dominican Americans (all those foot notes with messages along the lines of ""Didn't know the DR was Iraq before Iraq was Iraq, did you?"" prompted responses like, ""No sir, I did not""). Wonderful, flowing, insane prose. 
 (Thanks for the rec and the loan, Jill!)"
1,Hated this. Immature and unbelievable.
0,DNF at 35%. I know a lot of people love it but this book just wasn't doing it for me and I didn't want to spend another ten hours of my life listening to a female lead who was useless and a male lead who was kind of sleazy. I actually think this also had something to do with the narrators - they made these negative aspects come out more than any positive ones. Laia sounded SO whiny. And I was disappointed because half the reason I wanted to listen to this was because I have enjoyed Fiona Hardingham's narrating of other books quite a lot. ah well.
5,"I picked this up after reading And To All A Good Night, which was a short story that actually comes after this book. It intrigued me enough to find a copy of Life Lessons and it definitely did not disappoint. I absolutely loved Mac and Tony - they're such great characters by themselves and together, they're even better. 
 The plot was pretty interesting. I liked how the plot and Mac & Tony's relationship and their characters intertwined so well. 
 Definitely a favourite."
2,"Major issues with the main character, who is irritating and made me want to rip out each page she spoke. UNFORTUNATELY, that would be most of the book. Jordan was no great catch either, he had nothing going for him. The book is nothing special, and has no lessons or morals to learn about."
5,"wow... just amazing! I didn't expect to love it as much as I did. it was perfect! Jane is so smart and witty and ahead of her time - just like the author. I can't wait to read Villete. 
 oh and the ending is so nice. loved it loved loved it!!! 
 I can easily and without hesitating say though that it warrantly needs more than 5 stars"
4,"Ron Howard already has his hands on this book; so my advice to you: hurry up and pre-order this one so you can have it read before it's out in theaters! 
 If you want to find out who The Girl Before is you'll have to get on this fast ride and endure some whiplashing turns...I'll bet it won't be who you think it is, though you meet her early on, and overlook her in a way... I thought I knew within the first few chapters, but I was wrong--and I'm not telling, sorry. 
 One Folgate Street seems to be the perfect place for those wanting a decent home, yet can't afford one... but it has a strange ability to change it's residents.... The house was designed that way... with a computer system running all the facilities, and interrupting lives at the most inopportune moment, with questionnaires to answer--to see if the tenant(s) are progressing properly. This computer system, called Housekeeper had several beneficial aspects to the home owner...recognizing who was in the shower, and their water preferences, noticing the amount of REM sleep they got, checking their stress levels....and more. 
 Two women are each searching for a place to begin again. Emma, wants security after being violently burgled. Jane has just suffered the stillbirth of a perfect child due to hospital neglect, and needs to move on after quitting her high-paying job, and more importantly, leave the constant reminders that fill her present home of poor little Isabelle. The major problem both face are the terrible price of London flats, and the horrible state of those they can afford. 
 Enter Edward Monkford, a gorgeous, controlling perfectionist with plans* for his architecture to change the lives of those who inhabit his pristine, mausoleum like, architecture. (His idea of architecture and life had changed drastically after the tragic death of his wife and son on the grounds of the building site, but few know of the ancient Japanese ritual that also took place there....) This house is built of only the best materials and is stunningly beautiful in it's minimalism. No wonder it's won awards. The walls are smooth pale stone, all appliances and fixtures hidden from the naked eye...Usually only the rich can afford his places, so why is this place so cheap? 
 Because there's a catch. It begins with a huge questionnaire, with numerous, often seemingly odd questions that must be answered by any prospective tenants. Once finished with that process they are then made aware of a lengthy list of rules that would make life unbearable for most, even if smitten enough with the pristine, beautiful, award winning property to sign the list of rules (including no throw pillows, personal pictures, or books, just to name a few-this house is meant to bring order, peace, and better overall health to the lives of those who live inside). There were other rights to sign over in the lengthy small-typed package, a contract that the exhausted hopeful applicants rarely had the energy left to read closely. The final request was to send three recent pictures upon submittal. There was no secret that most hopefuls are quickly rejected by email--that precious few make it through the lengthy process and acquire an interview--the last hurdle. 
 Not until later does someone take notice of a striking resemblance the accepted tenants bear--not only to each other--but also to Edward's dead wife. All attractive, with the unusual combination of dark hair, porcelain skin, and deep blue eyes. 
 Emma and Jane both have that advantageous resemblance, and can't believe their fortune when chosen to live in this stunning, albeit artfully sparse, masterpiece house for only a pittance. They have no idea of the plans the architect has for them, and that they have become human guinea pigs. 
 One of the best parts of this book for me is it's POV, which is separated by chapters. We have Then: Emma, and Now: Jane. Emma had lived in the house before Jane, but ends up dead. I thought she must be the girl before. In a way she was. When Jane finds out about her, this thriller becomes a chilling mystery. As the POV's are first person, the story of Emma is a bit difficult because she is a very unreliable narrator, causing us to believe her lies, until the story unwinds enough to see who she really is. I loved the way these two stories were interwoven, one picking up quickly where the other had just left off. In no way were these hard to follow, rather the tension mounted as the reader realized there was something strange about their commonality, namely--Edward. I found it ingenious the way they fit together, and especially creepy as on some of the pages there was only a question, either from the computer check-ups, or the original form, that was particularly relevant to the situation going on. These chapter endings served to keep me engrossed in the book, feeling the need to read the next one to find out more. 
 (view spoiler)[Emma moved in with her boyfriend Simon--who passionately loved her--after the burglary that terrified her in her old neighborhood. Most personal items were not allowed in this clean lined house (one of the MANY rules), only a few items of clothing, some toiletries. Simon was not crazy to give up his beloved possessions, but Simon loved Emma far more, so he went along with it, as he always went along with Emma, wanting to make her happy. But soon, Emma is changing, she kicks Simon out, whom she thought she needed desperately weeks before. It's then that Edward enters her life....Yet, Emma had another problem: lies. She's told them to everyone, Simon, the police, the court, and Edward. To get out of the mess some of her lies have caused, she tells more lies--about people, lies that change their lives; and when she ends up dead...no one knows where to turn....the list of suspects is incredibly long, and her case remains unsolved unsolved. 
 When Jane moves in, she is comfortable living in the home's simplicity. It's a new start. One in which Edward also becomes entangled. Soon, she finds out about Emma, and the resemblance (as well as the story of Edward's wife). Her time is spent trying to piece together Emma's death. It's a course that leads her into danger. I loved to watch her amateur crime solving, as she meets many of the people from Emma's past; but there are far too many suspects to get her mind around. Her life becomes endangered when the true murderer gains access to her house (again...not the one I expected), and a terrifying night of hide and seek follows, with fear around every corner; the reader can't help but hold their breath as the pages turn and mysteries are solved. Can Jane overcome the murderer? Or will she end up as Emma had? Another dark haired, blue eyed girl spilling her life-blood on the immaculate stone of this house? Jane actually holds a prize...one in which we find the true meaning of who The Girl Before really is. Can she keep the prize and escape this house, alive? (hide spoiler)] 
 **""This is the future.....health and wellbeing monitored by your domestic environment."" Edward Monkford. The computer knows everything about them--but who is watching the computer? 
 Something I wanted to share: I was curious of the type of architecture mentioned in the book, so I researched it. Edward is a creature of habit....and during his time with them, taking both Emma, and then Jane to the structures that influenced his style of architecture. Here are some examples: 
 I am so frustrated that I could not get this picture on here! I feel it shows perfectly the beauty and simplicity of pale carved stone. Mentioned as the inspiration in the book. The beauty that inspired this amazing award winning fictional house that is really the star of the book. If at all curious as to this type of beauty, please click the link below. 
 This first one, with the masses of carved, pristine white stone is how I imagined Edwards architectural style: all beautifully pale in stone, with texture alone being the focus.

 A wholehearted thanks to Random House Publishing and the author via NetGalley for the chance to read this intriguing tale!"
3,"Veronica is a great source for new books. I started this one because of her high recommendations for the books farther into the series. She fell in the love with this series come book four. I wonder if I will too? At the least, I definitely had fun reading this one and plan to read more. 
 The author's note about Bithil Syndrome at the end of the book was really cool. I have a mental note to look into it. Is it weird if that's my favorite part? It makes sense. I mean, the syndrome is a key part of Sebastian and he is the main allure for me to keep reading. He's pretty cool and I want to get to know him better. 
 Overall, I liked the story more for not figuring out who the killer was until the end. This is suppose to be a mystery but it didn't feel like one to me. The case felt more like a mechanism to draw out the characters and the time period. The politics came across as heavy-handed and awkward. It's hard to take a character as smart when the actions do not back it up. 
 If I'm right, this story is the basis that will flower into more intrigue, drama and romantic entanglements. I caught ideas that are seeded in this one and I hope they will come to fruit later. 
 Harris did a wonderful job of setting up the characters in a manner that is easy to digest and you immediately have an idea of what to expect. I enjoyed the way I got to know Rachel. You get a hazy frame of her at the very beginning and fill in the outlines with tidbits of her life. It makes you want to know more about her. Even though she's dead and likely to play no farther part in the story. Pretty cool to care that much about a character that's dead. Yet, she was definitely a star within this novel. 
 Usually, I'm all for lovers to surpass all confrontations and conflict in order to be together. Not this time. This time, I like Sebastian so much that I'd rather he fall in love with someone else. I can see why he loves her. I'm definitely there with why she loves him. But I want more for him. For many, I'm sure others enjoy the mysteries that probably make up the stories in this series but that's not the main allure for me. I just want to dive into Sebastian's life, see what happens and cheer for him against the odds."
3,"3.5 - My guilty pleasure 
 Lori Foster is a big name in the Contemporary Romance genre and though there is an element of sameness about many of her books I can't help going back for more. Before I start reading I have a sense for what I'll get and because of that I am never disappointed. So what do her books deliver? Strong, hunky guy, overprotective but completely smitten with our heroine. In this case it was Cannon, a famous MMA fighter going by the name of The Saint. A heroine with some kind of tragic background who may appear to need protection but who is really quite strong if the right guy is there to help peel back the layers. In this case it was Yvette, a girl who had long harboured a crush on Cannon, even before Cannon had saved her life some years ago. There's usually a cast of strong supporting characters who will become the protagonists in future books in the series. (Armie, Stack & Denver books 2, 3 & 4 of the Ultimate series..Yes I looked them up). Some sub plots, the ocassional twist and always but always some sensual and steamy bedroom scenes. 
 Is this literary excellence? Not really (although I would be delighted if I could produce works of her calibre). Do I care? Not in the least. I read for enjoyment and without fail that's exactly what I get. Lori Fosters books are my guilty pleasure."

4,"http://thedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl/2... 
 It was a rollercoaster of feelings. I was frightened, disgusted, terrified and happy all at the same time. I'm sad to say goodbye to this stories and the characters I've grown to love, but Kagawa did it again. A fantastic ending to one of the best vampire series I've ever read. It was hard finding the right words to do this story justice, but I hope I can convince you to read this series if you haven't read the first book yet. This review is therefor completely spoiler-free. 
 There are often authors who excel in one aspect of writing, but Kagawa manages to nail them all. 
 World-building. 
 From the moment I started this series I loved the idea of this apocalyptic world where vampires rule over humans in cities and where our kind is plagued by a Red Lung virus and rabids. I never thought the situation could be any more worse, but that's exactly what happens here. The maniac Sarren wants to use a mutated virus to clean the earth from every inhabitant. The rabids he uses are TERRIFYING. Kagawa has her way with words and it's gross. Detailed, bloody and horrible: I loved it. There are multiple fighting scenes and they definitely made my heart pump faster. 
 Writing-style. 
 Like a movie. I was swept away in the story and the emotions of our cast. I was completely sucked into the story, which made some situations quite tense. Like I said in the intro: I went through a rollercoaster of feelings. Kagawa is a master in playing with your feelings and she knows how to paint a picture. Which is in this case quite a grim, scary place. 
 Characters. 
 ""Oh, isn't that sweet,"" came Jackal's loud, mocking voice before I could reply. ""Let's make goo-goo eyes at each other in the middle of a stinking corpse field, how every romantic."" Ignoring my glare, he kicked an arm out of his way and sauntered forward, the ax vanishing beneath his duster one more. 
 [GIF] 
 First of all: JACKAL. If Klaus and Damon from Vampire Diaries could get a child, it would be Jackal. This guy stole my heart with his sarcasm and blunt way of thinking. He has embraced his monster part, but I like the glimpses of good. His banters with his blood sister Allie were the best. I chuckled through their dialogues. I liked how unpredictable he is and he lightens every situation with his humor - and sometimes surprisingly smart remarks. 
 [GIF] 
 Allie, our tragic heroin who has to deal with the loss of her love Ezekiel (Zeke). She is incredibly confused in the beginning and she is starting to lose her sanity. I thought it was a realistic portrayal of her personality. The somewhat weakness in these moments made me admire her strength even more. It bordered on the line of whiny, but I tried to remember that she is only a new vampire. It's not strange that her feelings are a mess. She is still a bit reckless, but her heart is in the right place and I like determined characters. 
 [GIF] 
 Attractive, strong Kanin. The master vampire who is disappointed with Jackal, but who has high hopes for Allie. I like how he is always silent, brooding and mysterious, but at the same time deadly and powerful. His calming presence was a great addition to the story and he completed this trio in their quest to avenge and stop Sarren. 
 [GIF] 
 Who is an absolute freak. He must be one of the scariest and most mental disturbed characters I've ever read about. His actions show that he has no mercy and he is so convinced that is right. He leaves a path of destruction behind him when he is on his way to destroy the whole world. Kagawa still manages to make him a realistic character instead of a caricature. The fact that he believes that he is making the world better, makes him even creepier. His darkness combined with the already bleak situation made this book one hell of a ride. 
 There are some heart-breaking situations and some surprising twists, so what are you waiting for?"
5,"Why is it overrrrr. I should have learned from Mistborn not to start a Sanderson series if I couldn't handle binging it. Well. I binge read Steelheart, Mistosis, and Firefight and now I am upset I don't have more. Sigh. 
 Anyway. Firefight was great! I love how different it was and how things really evolved from the first book without me feeling like things are TOO different as I so often do with a seized book in a series. 
 The range of emotions totally got amped up a notch too. Some serious shipping, exciting action, great plotting, and yes -- so many more questions that I neeeeeed answered. *looks around* *waits impatiently* 
 Full review as originally posted on The Book Addict's Guide: Well, Brandon Sanderson, you did it again. I start a series, I binge read everything. Except unlike when I started Mistborn, I have no where else to go from here. FIREFIGHT just came out January... and I think I'll be waiting another YEAR for CALAMITY (but then again, I guess I can always read more Sanderson books in between that time, right? RIGHT). Anyway -- my point is that I just ended up loving these books so much that once I started, I couldn't stop!! 
 FIREFIGHT was a special kind of book to me because so many big bullet points about it about it SHOULD have made it fall into the ""second book in a series syndrome"" category but it definitely did NOT. AND I REJOICED! This really made the book even more magical. I realized it while I was reading but once I finished, it dawned on me that not only was this book great in general, but Brandon Sanderson managed to turn things that I usually don't get along with into things that I ended up loving and appreciating. I guess it really, truly does depend on the book and how it's put together! 
 But that realization aside, FIREFIGHT was already awesome. The action and intensity definitely increased a notch but the same characters and overall goals were there. FIREFIGHT actually takes place halfway across the country from STEELHEART and that actually didn't bother me like it usually does. The plot felt gracefully carried over and ultimately connected so the change in scenery was actually welcome and interesting instead of foreign. It opened up a new part of this altered world to me and I loved discovering it alongside David. (He's also a great tour guide to follow!) Even though Steelheart has been eliminated, there are always more Epics to stop so the action definitely doesn't stop with Steelheart's defeat. In fact, things continue to escalate and as the characters come to know more about each Epic as well as their abilities, the plot continues to thicken! 
 We meet a new cast of characters to accompany some familiar faces like David and Prof. I usually have a hard time getting to know a bunch of new characters later in a series simply because I've become attached to the original ones, but I actually really liked the newbies too! I don't think I connected to them AS much but I always felt like their presence was vital to the story and it was interesting to see a different string of Reckoners! 
 In true Sanderson form, of course there are some GREAT SURPRISES. They kill me but oh, how I love them. As you can see from my status updates below, some of them really caught me off guard and some of them absolutely terrified me but all of that really just enhanced my reading experience. Once again, I was afraid of ugly sobbing in my car as I listened to the audiobook, but that's just a sign of a really great connection to the book so I always take that as a win! I really become attached to these characters and after I finished the book, I was already missing this crew and that feeling I had as I was reading. 
 FIREFIGHT just continued another great series from Brandon Sanderson and I will constantly be awaiting his next book so I can quickly gobble it up and then feel full and hollow all at once! I'm so glad to have started this series and I'll be anxiously awaiting CALAMITY to see what in the world will possibly happen next! 
 (And yes, Megan is noticeably absent from my review. I had to go find out what happened to her, where she went, and what everything means for her and David in this book so you will too! Trust me -- it's all worth it.) 
 AUDIOBOOK IMPRESSIONS 
 Thank you again to Audible for hooking me up with this audiobook to review! As always, MacLeod Andrews is flawless. I just LOVE his narration and GOSH, these books. I mean, between Sanderson and his narration, I just FEEL all the feels, you know? These aren't even crying books but somehow I sobbed at both. A huge bravo and I highly recommend his narrations!"
2,"I barely finished this. If it hadn't been for a book club, I probably wouldn't have. 
 I find abhorrent the idea that humankind is so wretched that everything would be better off if we devolved to a more primitive hominid. As Protagoras may have said, ""Man is the measure of all things"", which means to me that existence has no meaning without an observer: by our measurement, we create the universe. We're not doing it too well these days, but a universe without us has nothing in it that could make it ""better"", since that word and all that it represents would disappear with us."
3,Quick easy read in the a favorite universe.
5,"Fun. It reminds me a great deal of Connie Willis' Passage, which I love, so that's good. I love the madcap aspect, and the crazy gods, a little like Neil Gaiman, but not so dark."

3,"When audible.com first advertised that Stephen Fry had recorded the entire Sherlock library I immediately bought it. I have never read any of the books before but I was certain I would love it, especially as recorded by Fry. I didn't love this one though. I liked it, but I expected more. I am hopeful though that as I learn more about the character and see his complexities I will be more enthralled."
3,"I have kind of mixed feelings on this book. I picked it up for review after reading it was recommended to fans of Cabin in the Woods. I think that's a great parallel but it's not quite as cool. Basically a mysterious long standing company The Sapanis extend an invitation to 5 seemingly unrelated teens to join them in the exploration of a historic underground French palace. That alone sounds pretty weird... Then it turns out that this corporation has very dubious intentions - oh, and there's a monster in the basement. The story cuts back and forth between the story of these teens and flashbacks to the original family living in the palace. This was just a lot to handle. The story came together in the end, but the way it came together was kind of underwhelming to me. I did enjoy the twisted adventure, but in the end it felt a little overworked."
0,"1) I've just been introduced to the existence of steampunk. 
 2) This cover is AWESOME. 
 3) This story has zombies, too."
2,"This book really wasn't that funny. I was hoping for something more with all the praise its gotten. The only story I found funny was the one about her eating her grandpa's birthday cake. Some of the other stories were still okay, just not funny."
4,"Flew through this book! While I didn't agree with all the characters choices this book was addicting, I liked the writing style and I appreciated that it wasn't your average YA contemporary. 
 I don't condone the relationship that went on between young Rena and Sawyer but I do think that this book showed an interesting level of maturity, in that Rena could be a mother, but also dealt with emotions appropriate to her age. The characters are still young even in the ""after"" portions of the book, but the things they've gone through have definitely aged them. There emotions are high strung, often volatile and inconsistent, as most teen emotions are. I think I appreciated the fact that the author didn't shy away from the fact that despite having to be an adult because you have a child doesn't mean you're immune from emotions. (This is rambley and I'm not sure it actually describes how I feel, le sigh.)"
3,"Holy cliffhanger! Everything was going okay, a little meandering and wishy-washy, but what's with the cliffhanger? This book is long and after loyally slogging through its many chapters and turns and indecisiveness, it ends in a cliffhanger??? 
 okay, fine. I like Lara Jean. She's a middle child and has all of the in-betweenness of a middle child. Her mother died when she was young and her older sister took over. Meanwhile her younger sister gets to be the baby and have everyone look after her. 
 Lara Jean's afraid to drive, she's unsure which guy she really likes, she likes Margo's boyfriend, and she's afraid of her best friend's cousin who's dating a guy she thinks she doesn't like but really likes. Since she is stuck in the middle, she writes letters to the guys she likes but she locks it in her hatbox. 
 I pretty much suspected the real reason her love letters were mailed, and sure enough, I was right. There really wasn't too much mystery, so the suspense came down to which boy Lara Jean would end up with. Except instead of being rewarded with a happy ending, we get a cliffhanger. 
 (view spoiler)[ 
 Actually now that I think about it, the father was way too absent and clueless. If he were really raising three daughters without a mother around, he would be a lot more vigilant and wary about the boys hanging around. We read that Margo had sex with Josh, but that was never, ever addressed. Lara Jean finds out and then goes about it like nothing. If it were me, it would have totally ruined Josh for me. But instead, Lara Jean is still pining for Josh, and it was only after Josh kissed her and she somehow decided there was no spark, that she decided to like Peter, who has his own issues too, i.e. having sex with the high school bully. Ugh... now that I think about it, why would she like either of these guys? (hide spoiler)]"
4,"4.5 stars 
 This is Jeanette's autobiography. She looks back on life with her oddball, quirky family. A family where Dad was often drunk, they rarely had enough money (and often no food to eat), as Dad usually spent it on booze, Mom just sort of went with the flow, plus there were three other siblings. They moved a lot, usually in a car that could barely make it, and they sometimes lived in the car, but everything was made out to be an adventure. The kids were often left to their own devices. Jeanette was her dad's favourite, and you could tell they loved each other, despite some of the things her father did. 
 The book really wasn't what I expected. Her parents tended to put a positive spin on things, even when bad things happened. I didn't expect it to be like that. You could tell there was love there, even through everything."
5,"This was such a beautiful, heartachey read. It's one of those slow unfurling stories, not like the petals of a flower, more like the layers of an onion, if you get what I'm saying. Quietly powerful, raw, intense, far from pretty but painfully and beautifully honest. 
 Nastya radiates pain, she has a ""black belt in self-pity,"" she's sarcastic, angry, strong but damaged, scarred physically and emotionally. She doesn't speak but I loved her inner dialogue. 
 Josh has faced more loss and grief than anyone his age should have to. He's strong and caring, a genuine good guy but that doesn't mean every decision he makes is a smart one, I liked that though, it made him more real to me. 
 Drew is best friend to Josh and Nastya, he's the sweetheart with a playboy reputation and the fun and light in this story. I thought he was gorgeous, he affectionately refers to Nastya as 'Nastypants' and his playful innuendo and banter cracked me up. 
 Nastya and Josh are drawn to each other ... mutual pain and all that. I love how their relationship builds ... Josh becoming Nastya's safe harbour. 
 ""I know at that moment what he's given me and it's not a chair. It's an invitation, a welcome, the knowledge that I am accepted here. He hasn't given me a place to sit. He's given me a place to belong."" 
 Katja Millay writes with a depth of emotion that brought tears to my eyes. Yep I cried ... more than once. No insta-love or easy fixes, no perfect ending but perfectly ended. You really have to read this yourself, don't let the angst and pain put you off, The Sea Of Tranquility is as much about realisations and healing and forgiveness and second chances. 
 Recommend: You'll be missing out if you don't!"
4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 How to even talk about this book? So good and so devastating. I think this is the first Goodreads review I've ever marked as containing spoilers, because I don't know how to talk about it otherwise. 
 The twin storylines were so effective and overwhelmingly foreboding. I had bad dreams every night while I was reading this because I knew something awful was going to happen but I couldn't figure out what. 
 In a way, I feel like Emilio; why was I led to love all the characters so much, given what was going to happen to all of them? Which is kind of a nice mirroring by the author of the book's main theme. Still, I cried. 
 The hand thing freaked me out. I also didn't quite buy that given all the extenuating circumstances (mutilation, PTSD, etc etc) no one guessed at what had happened to Emilio, but immediately jumped to the worst possible conclusion about him. Then again, Kelly pointed out that there were a lot of things not in his favor: a damning and (thanks to time dilation) longstanding alleged version of events, no one who really knew him around to give him the benefit of the doubt, his very prickly attitude. 
 I really liked how the religion was handled; thoughtful, respectful, neither heavy-handed or reductionist. I want more priests + scifi books! This and A Canticle for Liebowitz can't be the only ones."
1,"I didn't hate this. That's pretty much the only positive thing I can say about it. I absolutely hate fated mates. I can handle it if the mate bond is separate from the characters getting to know each other and falling in love, but that wasn't the case here. The characters pretty much became one instantly, with all the mind reading, feeling each others' pain, and telepathic connection stuff that often goes with fated matings. If I'd know this book had that I definitely would not have read it. 
 There was no conflict between the characters at all. Since they could read each others' minds and feel each others' feelings, how could there be? The only conflict was external, and that was sporadic at best. A conflict would spring up only to be resolved in a few pages. I had no motivation to keep reading and was really bored. There was no romantic tension at all. 
 Also I thought the sex scenes were boring and way too frequent. Anus is not a sexy word and it was used way too often."
4,"I don't always like spin-off novellas, but these are great. The theme of friendship is strong in these."
4,"WOW! I still can't believe how much I enjoyed this book! It completely exceeded my expectations! Cress has been such a fun read and is easily my favorite book in the series thus far. 
 This third installment of the Lunar Chronicles follows a new protagonist inspired by the classic fairy tale character Rapunzel. Cress - an adorably petite but highly skilled hacker - has been locked away on a Lunar satellite for nearly half her life when Cinder and the rest of the Rampion's crew contact her. 
 I usually find naive and seemingly helpless characters like Cress to be annoying and unlikable. But since chapter one, I found Cress to be one of the most lovable and believable characters in this series. She's certainly not your typical badass heroine - she isn't fierce like Scarlet nor is she pragmatic like Cinder. She is awkward and shy and she has a vivid imagination, but she's also bright and just so dang cute. 
 Because this book follows such a large cast of characters, Meyer was unable to showcase development for each of them. But while we didn't see much progression for characters like Wolf and Scarlet, the development we did see for characters like Cress, Cinder, and even Iko was wonderful! 
 I have come to like Cinder more and more with each progressing book. Although she was initially afraid to admit to her mistakes, the vulnerability she showcases at the end of the novel was one of my favorite parts of the series by far. And I think it goes without saying that I am obsessed with Captain Thorne. His witty one-liners aside (which I love, by the way), Thorne's character development, especially with regards to his relationship with Cress, was honest and believable. I loved that their relationship was much more realistically flawed than Scarlet and Wolf's insta-love in the previous book. 
 Overall, Cress is well-balanced, fast-paced, action-packed and filled with a number of unexpected surprises and plot twists. Marissa Meyer has created a wonderful YA sci-fi/fantasy series that I can't recommend enough. I am really looking forward to picking up Winter and seeing how this series ends. I loved what little we saw of Princess Winter in Cress, so I'm excited to see what sort of dynamic she adds to our beloved gang of misfits."
4,"Sixteen year old Rhine is taken from her home, ripped from her twin brother and sold off to be a wife. In this unique dystopian, Lauren Destefano presents us with a world that has been shattered by genetic modifications. The generation in search of perfection, eradicating diseases, and altering DNA to perfection has ended up with a population off girls that die by age twenty and males that die by twenty five. 
 Rhine is not alone, every day girls are kidnapped out of their impoverished homes and sold on the black market to the highest bidder. Rhine finds herself, along with two other girls, sold to a twenty year old house governor. 
 As you would expect with any dystopian novel, obviously Rhine is unhappy about her situation and wants to live out the rest of her life (all four years) in freedom, not slavery. Of course Rhine develops and escape plan and of course there is a s midge of a love triangle. 
 I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. It was a fast and easy read and I'm a big time sucker for dystopian. There were only a few minor flaws, I felt a few characters could have been developed a little more. For instance, I found House Governor Linden's character more deep than Gabriel (view spoiler)[ the boy that Rhine decides to run away with. I didn't entirely understand Rhine's relationship with Gabriel or how she fell into the attraction so seamlessly. I know so much more about Linden than Gabriel. (hide spoiler)] 
 Rhine has three sister wives at first. Lady Rose, Linden's first wife who has just turned twenty and is dying, Jenna her quiet eighteen year old confidant, and Cecily the thirteen year old spoiled rotten child bride. I felt it difficult to connect with Jenna and was more puled towards Cecily, unlikable as she may be. It seems the important characters like Gabriel and Jenna fell a bit flat to me. (view spoiler)[ I was not nearly moved enough when Jenna died as I felt I should have been. Rhine was devastated and I wanted to be devastated too but I just didn't feel that connection with her. (hide spoiler)] 
 It was also a bit distracting that Destefano ends a few sentences with prepositions. Though I know the novel is supposed to be easy and conversational, I still found it to be a bit distracting. The tone was a bit too casual for me, if only because as a young adult book this should be presenting positive grammar to encourage teens. 
 Aside from the ending (view spoiler)[ and escape (hide spoiler)] being far too easy and unrealistic for my liking, I really did enjoy this book. I finished it last night and bought the sequel first thing this morning.I am starting it as soon as I post this review. If you love dystopian this is definitely a must read for you."
3,"I've watched the anime film of Vampire Hunter D, and was intrigued to see what the book's like. As January is vampire month for the Paranormal Challenge, I thought this seemed like a good time to give it a try. 
 I wasn't quite sure what to make of the book at first because it's written in a very odd style. I suppose this could be down to the translation, but to me it felt like a deliberate choice. It seemed to be going for a kind of 'pulp' style, which suits the weird setting and atmosphere, but it definitely slid over into the realms of cheesy at points. This includes a detached non-character narrator who occasionally appears to talk back to himself, sometimes talks directly to the reader, and who observes events without hindsight or omniscience, as if watching a film for the first time: there was a black shadow in the corner but D didn't notice it... D looked around the room... a cat rubbed up against D's leg - oh that must have been the black shadow! (Okay, so that wasn't an actual quote, but it gives an idea.) 
 However, though this was a little disrupting at first, I did get used to it, and I began to see why Hideyuki Kikuchi had chosen to write like this. Vampire Hunter D clearly owes a lot to old Hammer Horror films: there are constant references to them, the vampire count is called Lee, the book is dedicated to the cast and crew of Horror of Dracula ('58), and the author talks about the influence such films had on him. The sometimes cheesy dialogue and narration did actually capture a sense of this kind of over-dramatic, fun-yet-still-frightening horror. Combined with Japanese elements, the author's own unique style and vision, and a lot of manga/anime influence, this actually blossomed into what was quite a quirky, different, and fun style. 
 The story is a very simple white-knight and damsel-in-distress tale, made more interesting by the unique world Hideyuki Kikuchi has created. It's 12,090 AD, a far future in which mankind has almost ruined the Earth, blown itself up in nuclear world war, slid into another Dark Ages, been taken over by vampires, risen against the vampires, and now exists in a kind of uneasy state of freedom. There are futuristic gadgets and inventions, the horses are cyborgs, and the vampire castle has laser defence systems. Yet the world has also reverted into a kind of small-town, agricultural, past age, with a society to match. Pretty much everything technical the humans possess came from the vampires, and there is a sense that there is no innovation or invention anymore. On top of this, there are all kinds of bizarre supernatural creatures roaming the Earth, most of them bioengineered by the vampires for the lolz. 
 This is a fantastic setting, and the weird mix of fantasy, old-world, paranormal and futuristic works very well. I loved it. But, unfortunately, the story did not really live up to this amazing creation. Doris Lang is bitten by a vampire and hires D, a vampire hunter, to help her with her unwanted admirer. D runs off to the castle, and the rest of the story is a series of incidents designed to instigate as many fights as possible, while Doris is constantly whisked away, providing more chances for D to save her. This got old very quickly for me, as did the never-ending introduction of more elite bad guys. The story is full of people who are so quick and incredible at fighting that none of them actually appear to move. D is always the very definition of cool - calm and unafraid of anything, not because he's brave but because he knows he's the best - and this kind of character tends to irritate me. Where's the emotion, the tension, the character development? There were odd points where D did show a real person lurking beneath the surface, and these were the most interesting parts. It was a shame that this never lasted very long. 
 I also found Doris' character to be rather annoying. She starts out with an incredible strength; she is brave despite her fear, looks after her little brother and the farm with no help, deals with all manner of problems, is self-assured and determined, but also kind and well-meaning. She seeks help because she knows a vampire is a formidable foe that she cannot face alone. Then she meets D, and as D begins to do more for her, she gets steadily weaker. By the end of the story, a girl who took on everything and anything on her own can't even lift a bucket without D's help. She tells her little brother that she now doesn't think she can manage on her own. I understand that she would be tired and in shock after everything that happened, but I do prefer characters to grow with their experiences rather than become more helpless. 
 Vampire Hunter D is an interesting and quirky book, and certainly worth reading for its weird and wonderful world alone. The story is simple, and at points it lets the book down, as does some of the characterisation. A short and light-hearted read, often entertaining, sometimes frustrating, but very unique.

4,"3.75 stars, review TBA! 
 P.S. I'm reading this as a stand-alone, I feel like it stands for itself quite well :)"
2,"Keeping this review short and sweet... I loved the first book, it kept me intrigued from the beginning, but it all went dramatically downhill from there. Luce and Daniel have to be the most predictable and boring protagonists on the planet, and I am glad to say I have finished this book purely because the series is now over. 
 For me, the other fallen angels, particularly Gabbe and Cam, were the only aspects of these books that were bearable as they actually made a semi-interesting and fun storyline. Plus, quite frankly, Luce and Daniel (and Miles and Shelby...oh my god, *yawn*) were filled with way too much drama for a very un-intriguing love life. 
 I can safely say I will never re-read these books."
5,Loved it! Can't wait for the next one. Wonder which character they'll feature. Hope it's Michonne.
4,"Leia is one of my favorite Star Wars characters. She's been raised by strong, loving, smart, dedicated parents into a strong, smart, loving, dedicated person and I love seeing her show those traits at various points in her life. I really liked this book, and how it showed the difficulties she faces making strategic decisions. I liked her team, too, although in my head, all I could see for Lokmarcha is the potato guy from Doctor Who. 
 Also, I think this is the only time I've seen Nien Nunb get translated - it's no wonder he hangs out with Lando."
4,"Alex loves history, fears Nazis, got kicked out of her last school for spray painting something about Communists across the gym floor, and suffers from schizophrenia. She's never sure (and has never been sure) if what she sees is really there or is just a schizo symptom. For instance, when she was 7, she met a boy in the grocery store at the lobster tank. Together (but with Alex as the instigator), they set those lobsters free. That boy with the stain-glass blue, blue eyes, made quite an impression on her. She never saw him again but always wondered about him. Imagine her surprise when she starts her senior year at a new high school and finds that his name is Miles and he is her classmate. Miles is the smartest boy in school. And the weirdest. And the most hated. Will he remember her from the lobster tank? Does she want him to remember her? Is he real? Was he real then? Made You Up is the story of Alex trying to manage her disorder while carving out a new life for herself. Although I loved the writing in this one, I had a problem with Miles' character at the beginning of the book. He was supposed to be this hated character. The reader is repeatedly given this information, but I didn't feel like we were ever SHOWN how he was a hated character. He was definitely a fascinating character from the beginning, though. I truly cared about him and Alex and what would happen to them. The mystery sub-plot about the principal, the scoreboard, and his obsession with Scarlet - the girl killed by the scoreboard? Didn't care about that so much. This meh side story won't keep teens from liking this book, though. Good stuff."
5,"this is definitely not what i expected it to be. i thought it was going to be some cheesy romance with no substance, but it's actually a story of self-discovery and strength and there's just a lot of stuff going on internally with the main character and i'm very into it"
5,"So, so good. That's all. Go read this series if you haven't already."
4,"It took me a while to warm up to this book, but it's a relatively long book for its genre. Sullivan does a great job of tying everything together in the end. Some characters are more likeable than others, but I did like the various stories and did want to see how they all turned out."
5,"Oh, man! I loved this book! Everyone was so terrible and undeserving! I thought it was so lovely!!!"
4,I would have given this book 5 stars if it wasn't for the ending. I really did not care at all for the ending. It was rushed and I didn't like the aspect of the partial cliffhanger :(
5,Review to come.
5,"4.75 stars. This book was so good. Honestly, the only thing preventing me from giving it 5 stars was that it was slow to start. That said, I think it was worth it. Full review HERE."
3,A good sequel with an interesting plot. The writing was good and the characters were just as good as in the previous book. The ending was a little fast and abrupt but altogether an enjoyable read.
5,"This book gut-punched me in the butterflying dick hole! I have been traumatized! 
 Everything was going so well, until it wasn't, and then it goes back to happy, and then WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU, HOOVER?! 
 Oh guys, it hurt! It was a happy ending, but it hurt."
2,"** spoiler alert ** 
 Swedish murder mysteries are all the rage thanks to Steig Larsson. Is long time mystery writer Henning Mankell irritated that Steig stole his Swedish thunder or is he glad to ride the tsumani? Based on the first Kurt Wallander mystery, Faceless Killers, I think he should be happy to ride the wave. The book is a fast paced police procedural that doesn't get bother with a lot of character development for anyone beyond our hero Wallander. In fact, I could hardly tell his colleagues apart other than thinking of labels like ""the gambler"" or ""the guy with the limp"". The mystery is a brutal double murder but is resolved through incredible luck. *Spoiler: Doesn't it seem like cheating to find a witness with a photographic memory who can provide details of a particular uneventful day as a bank teller 6 months earlier?? 
 Despite my complaints I did enjoy this book - although I enjoyed the first half set up much more than the rapid paced ending - and I can imagine that the Wallander books develop over time to provide more dimension to recurring characters and more complexity to the mysteries. A serviceable read for a winter afternoon."
4,"4 Stars 
 Overall Opinion: I always tend to enjoy the f-buddies to more type stories, and this didn't disappoint! Unlike a lot of those type stories, it actually had some depth and feelings! It was light hearted at times, and I got that giddy love feeling about these 2 mcs -- but it also covered some heavy themes, such as loving people that are struggling with addiction. I think it was a great balance between the two tbh, and I enjoyed it! My only criticism would be that there was some parts that felt a little tedious when the h was going through her internal struggles about her mom. 
 Brief Summary of the Storyline: This is Naomi and Damien's story. They meet one night when Naomi goes to tattoo parlor to get a piercing after breaking up with her long-term boyfriend. The sparks fly, but the encounter isn't the best. They bump into one another again, and they have a ONS. But after deciding that one night isn't enough, they decide to start a friends-with-benefits type relationship. Both of them have some heavy things going on in their lives. They grow closer, have some sexy times, fall in love, and help each other through their tough times...and get a HFN ending. 
 POV: This alternated between Naomi and Damien's POV. 
 Overall Pace of Story: Good. I never skimmed, and I thought it flowed well. 
 Instalove: No, but they did have an instant connection. 
 H rating: 4.5 stars. Damien. He was pretty awesome! He was sweet, loyal, dominant (not bdsm here), and hot! My only issue (and it was small) was his reluctance to give his sister a break at times, but I understood that it had to be difficult for him....so I forgive him :) 
 h rating: 4 stars. Naomi. I liked her sass, her loyalty, and her ability to brighten others up. She struggles a lot at one point and reacts poorly, but I cannot say that I wouldn't act the same way if I went through the same thing...so, again, I forgive her ;) 
 Sadness level: Low/moderate. I teared up a few times, but I never needed any tissues. 
 Push/Pull: Yes (view spoiler)[ The h has decided that she isn't ready for another relationship, so she pushes the H away emotionally for a little bit, and when she has some issues with her mother she also pushes him away. The H is the main pursuer in the relationship. (hide spoiler)] 
 Heat level: Moderate. They have some hot chemistry and scenes, but not so much it takes away from the storyline. 
 Descriptive sex: Yes 
 Safe sex: Yes. Condoms, birth control, and STD status are all discussed. Neither had gone without condoms before. (view spoiler)[ For you safety gals -- H has been celibate for 2 years after only being with a ""handful"" of partners, so no manwhore here! (hide spoiler)] 
 OW/OM drama: No (view spoiler)[Closest thing is the h had just broken up with her ex, and she bumps into him -- but it doesn't really cause all that much drama (just some internal questioning). (hide spoiler)] 
 Sex scene with OW or OM: No 
 Cheating: No 
 Separation: No. They are away from each other for days, but I wouldn't call it a separation. 
 Possible Triggers: Yes (view spoiler)[ Drug abuse (parent) and alcoholism (sister) (hide spoiler)] 
 Closure: This had good closure with a cute epilogue and a HFN ending. I only call it HFN because I am extremely picky with what I call a HEA, so others might be fine with calling this one a HEA even though I didn't (view spoiler)[they live together and are engaged (hide spoiler)]. 
 How I got it: 
 **This was gifted to me by the author in exchange for an honest review** 
 Safety: I'd say that this should be Safe for most of the safety gals. 
 (view spoiler)[ 
 - Does Not have cheating 
 - Does Not have a descriptive sex scene with OW/OM 
 - Does have the h pushing the H away 
 - Does Not have a separation between the h and H 
 - Does Not have abuse 
 - Does Not have OTT sad parts 
 - Does Not have a HEA ending (see above closure section) (hide spoiler)]"
4,"So glad with how it ended. 
 Full review! :) 
 http://haraiah.blogspot.com/2013/07/r..."
5,I'm so excited about jumping into this series again.
2,"In all honesty, I did not like this series. I only started it because of Colleen Hoover and I love all her other books. After the first one I realized this wasnt a series for me. But I continued and finished this novella trilogy just to get the answers the first one made me have. Overall, this series was blah and will not be rereading ever"
3,"It's been eight months and thirteen days since Justina has kissed a boy and she fully intended to find out what sort of kisser Ian Clark is, until she finds herself ditched in a ditch the day after prom. Things, did not go according to plan. 
 Ditched begins the morning after prom as Justina finds herself in a ditch on Hollister Road and wanders into the nearby 7-Eleven. That, is where she'll ultimately reveal the details of the previous night to Gilda, the woman working at the 7-Eleven. Let's just say that Justina's dress has been through hell and each stain and rip tells of events throughout the night--also, I couldn't help but wince a bit when I thought about completely matching like that. Maybe that's just my personal nightmare, but I'm happy I wasn't coerced into a single shade like that for my prom. 
 Ditched by her date and very close friend, Ian, Justina can't help but feel terrible and it definitely shows. However, let's be honest here, he sounds like a great guy and whenever Justina would assume that he'd left her to be an ass... well, let's just say that I'd like to shake some sense into her. Justina is pretty hard headed throughout most of Ditched and I think this definitely affected my reading experience because she really doesn't want to believe that someone like Allyson Moore could want to help her or well, just be nice. That's not to say that Justina isn't nice, only that she doesn't seem to understand when (or why) certain people are trying to help her. After all, she befriends Serenity and Bliss--the girls that Mike and Mike bring to their prom. Oh! Did I mention that there's a three-legged Chihuahua named Chompers McGee? That's probably the cutest name for a tiny dog that likes to be toothy! 
 If I'm honest, I wish that Ditched would've included the minor characters a bit more and that maybe we would've seen a bit past prom (although I can understand why it ended where it did). It wasn't that I didn't like the ending, but I just feel like it would've felt more complete--at least to me--if it had continued until graduation or something. Having said that, if you're up for a wild ride and ready to shake your head at some of Justina's antics, I'd recommend Ditched to you. 
 Overall Rating: and a half."
4,"So, more or less, if Looking for Alaska and Moby-Dick had a baby, it would be Paper Towns (without all the mind-numbing whaling details). 
 Also, I've figured out the enjoyment values for John Green books. Ready? (And remember, the alligator eats the bigger number.) 
 Looking for Alaska > The Fault in Our Stars > Paper Towns > Will Grayson, Will Grayson > An Abundance of Katherines 
 So, there you go."
4,"Very interesting re-telling of the story of Dinah, daughter of Jacob and Leah from the Old Testament. I liked how the author fleshed out the characters and gave them personality. When reading the Bible it is sometimes difficult to think of the patriarchs and their families as real people who aren't perfect and who had other events in their lives besides what is recorded in Genesis. Obviously this is a work of fiction, we have no way of knowing what really happened to Dinah, but I like this telling."
5,"I adore this series, and this is a brilliant ending. Beautifully written, emotional, moving, but what's really impressive is the way the series as a whole is handled. So that what seems to be a minor subplot in book 1 and then a key plot element extraneous to the main relationship in book 2 becomes the solution to everything in book 3. This is a proper trilogy, with the relationship's progression and the rolling plot elements really well handled, while each book is intensely satisfying individually. You don't have to try many trilogies to see quite how hard that is to pull off. 
 Not an easy solution, and we see the cost of David and Murdo's HEA, but we have no trouble believing they're both happy to pay it. 
 I glommed this book in a sitting. I can't recommend this trilogy enough (don't give me 'I don't like historicals', you'll like this) and I am grumpy that it's over."
2,"While certain parts weren't terrible, this isn't really my cup of tea and I can't see myself finishing the series when there are so many books that are my cup of tea out there. 
 I will say I knew Beauty would do what she did at the end ahead of time though... it was kind of obvious."
5,"I immensely enjoyed this collection of short stories. Each one was absolutely hilarious yet heartbreaking, and I sensed a common theme within them all. There are nine stories in this anthology, with each being more outlandish than the last. From a scorned woman stealing her ex-husband's tortoise to a couple seeking therapy for their depressed hedgehog, I was completely enthralled with this collection once I picked it up. 
 Appel's writing style is unique, humorous, and completely real. He holds nothing back, and with some of these stories he is able to build such suspense that I found myself short of breath, while with others I was crying with laughter. Each story is an absolute gem. 
 I absolutely recommend this book. It was the perfect quick read that was filled with comedy, personality, and yet held morals within that spawn one to think upon his own life and to ponder these struggles that the adult mind faces. I learned, I laughed, and I empathized with all of these characters. Absolutely brilliant. 
 *I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review."
4,"This book gave me a lot to not think about. 
 It's all there in the subtitle: the power of thinking without thinking. And while it was a fascinating read, it offered little of practical value, because, as some reviewers have noted, Gladwell outlines numerous examples of uncannily accurate rapid cognition, alongside counter-examples where such immediate first impressions go horribly, catastrophically wrong. Is that snap impression you just had in the first category or the second? Quick! Decide now! Not sure? Maybe you should take a moment to think about it . . . 
 Don't expect that this book is going to help you make better quick decisions, because it won't. But, to contradict my earlier assertion--which I just jotted down extemporaneously without any rigorous cognitive appraisal--it'll give you a lot to think about."
5,"What happens when broken girl finds love and understanding from a seriously hot guy? Magic! I have been waiting for this one to be published since I read the last word in Ruining Me. Do not read this book without reading Ruining Me first! I'm not sure how I am going to get Jay, JT, Rhys, Kane and Eli out of mind. Their story sucks you in and holds you hostage...but you are so happy to be there you are upset when they let you go! Please oh please give Rhys or Cole or Eli a book...heck anything that will revisit these characters now that the outcome is clear. I don't want to spoil this series by discussing the details of the problems these kids encounter(Read Book 1 NOW!) so all I will say is this author knows her way around teenage tragedy. You will be crying, gasping and aching for these fictional people. 
 ""Time is now measured from the night when death stole from me, took my battered heart, and left me behind."" - Jay 
 When Jay wakes up from her attempted suicide following a horrific accident so knows she is not strong enough to recover on her own. She checks in to a private mental facility and meets Eli. He has trouble of his own but is willing to open his heart to this broken girl and help her get back to herself. 
 ""Don't let go now, Jay. One-by-one, place each piece of your soul back together, but this time, make it stronger. Close your eyes and do it."" - Eli 
 ""Don't lose out on something that could be forever because you think the timing isn't right. Don't let fate decide,"" -Eli 
 Jay loves Kane and has since we last saw them in the first book but she thinks he deserves a girl that isn't broken. ""He makes me feel like breathing; he isn't a choice. He is what it takes for me to live""...Jay about Kane. Wow, just Wow! 
 This story of sadness, shame, and heartbreak will keep you turning pages until the last word. Read this series NOW!"
5,"Hot, passionate and addicting!!! This book totally hooked me! It made my heart race and completely got under my skin! And Holy Hot Gods, Gavin Blake!!! I couldn't stop reading! Totally schmexy book!!! 5 flippin' fantabulous stars!!! 
 ------------------ 
 Deep breath. THIS book. This crazy, captivating, compelling and calamitous book!!! It had it all!!! It made me swoon, it made me crazy mad, it made my heart hurt for all those moments rooted in wrongness and misunderstanding. And despite the fact that the book had a love triangle (which I typically avoid), I knew all along who she SHOULD be with! It was love at first sight! And I just LOVED this book! 
 ""Fate and the roads that get placed in front of us. It's like one huge puzzle that ultimately fits in the end."" 
 Emily Cooper moves to New York after her mother tragically succumbs to breast cancer. Her boyfriend Dillon has been there for her throughout her mom's battle and has now moved her up to New York to be with him. But not quite ready to move in with her boyfriend, Emily decides to live with her best friend, Olivia. After Emily finds a job working at a restaurant, an unexpected food delivery takes her face-to-face with the most gorgeous and alluring man she's ever seen. 
 ""Her breath hitched at the sight of the tall, devastatingly beautiful man who was making his way toward her. She felt thrown off kilter as though her equilibrium had skewed itself all over the building."" 
 The gorgeous man in the three-piece suit felt just as drawn to the beautiful delivery girl. 
 ""Gavin Blake had believed that love at first sight didn't exist ... Her beauty instantly hit him. But more so, he felt drawn to her as a rope bound his waist, and she was on the other end pulling him to her."" 
 Despite the instant and intense attraction, Emily walks away from the beautiful stranger only to find him again at the restaurant where she works. He couldn't stay away. But she fights her body, her blazing desire for this man because of her relationship with Dillon. He's been supportive of her and she loves him. So she gives him a fake name, Molly, and throws away his telephone number. And then the unlikely happens as worlds collide when she runs into Gavin yet again and becomes aware that not only is he Dillon's client, but he is also a close friend. Gavin is crushed when he realizes she is ""Dillon's Emily."" They both struggle to keep their desire at bay, but the attraction between them is torrid and cannot be waned. 
 ""Attracting, compelling, colliding, their chemistry-to say the least-was explosive."" 
 In the meanwhile, she sees a different side of Dillon in New York. He's possessive and temperamental and is constantly telling her what she should and shouldn't do. Secretly, however, Gavin continues to entice Emily. He's charming, caring, sexy, seductive ... everything her heart and body is screaming for. He's also known for his womanizing ways. 
 I was enamored with this book!!!! Their attraction is crazy strong, palpable, oozing from every page. I wanted nothing more than for Emily to give Dillon the big finger and run into Gavin's arms. But so much indecision weighs Emily down and things of course continue to intensify. 
 ""Damn it, Emily. I want us! You belong with me, not him... Every part of you was made for me. Your lips were made to kiss mine, your eyes were made to wake up to me looking at you in my bed every morning and your fucking tongue was made to roll my name off of it. I am more certain of us than I'm certain I require oxygen to breathe."" 
 I don't want to ruin the experience that is this book and I promise you my review doesn't do it justice, but I don't want to give anything away! It's hot and sexy and brimming with desire and want and love and heartache. 
 ""I've never felt so heartbroken and so in love at the same time."" 
 Gail McHugh writes in such a way that totally gripped me. I felt what these characters were feeling and I couldn't let this book go. I was elated when they were happy and torn to absolute pieces especially towards the end. And yes, there's a cliffhanger that left me with the BIGGEST damn book hangover. And God, you will LOVE Gavin Blake. He is so real and raw with so much depth of feeling that you can't help but pine for him yourself. 
 In the end, this book is about two people colliding intensely, unexpectedly, to find the truest, deepest, soul-mate kind of love and figuring out that it's worth fighting for. Go out and get this book now!!! It's AH-FREAKIN-MAZING!!!! I can seriously not wait for Pulse, the continuation of this story, to see what happens.

5,"Gah--so disturbing and sad and good! It's told mainly from the points of view of three kids destined for ""unwinding"", Connor, Risa and Lev. This device can sometimes make a story feel a little fractured in my experience, but Shusterman pulls it off beautifully, and I really cared about all three of the main characters. They each are being unwound for different reasons, and look at things from different perspectives, which made for a lot of interesting conflicts and discussions about beliefs and complex questions. In fact, I think the questions are the main point of this book--there's not a huge resolution, and all the problems are not solved. I suppose a sequel could be written to cover what happens afterward, but I honestly hope that Shusterman does not write one. I think there's much impact in the open endedness of the conclusion to the book that would be lessened by a sequel that tells exactly where things go from there. In any case, this story is haunting enough to keep bouncing around in your head for a long time after you've finished it. 
 Really excellent. 
 ------------------------------------------ 
 On second read, I liked it even more. And it managed to make me cry, AGAIN. So, so good."
3,"Reread! This is the weakest Kate Daniels book, for me, because it doesn't really have the same tone as the rest of the series. It's pretty much a loner on a mission story. There are some fun glimpses of things that I love about the series (Curran picking peas out of his chinese food, Kate and Derek bonding, etc.) but they're just glimpses."
5,It was incredible!! Review to come soon
5,"A Little Too Hot is so very HOT!!! 
 I can not tell you how hot it is. From the very first I was hooked and it kept getting better and Better. 
 I never thought I would love it so much, but oh man, I do! If you have read the previous two books in this Hot series you know it can get really steamy in here quick. And in this latest, Gosh it was steamy from the first I read about that stranger Harrison! 
 Oh my Harrison! I'm not trying to swear but Oh My Gosh! He's so hot and I thought Alessandro from A Little Too Much was hot, Harrison is to die for~ 
 Okay so we have Samantha whom we met in book one, A Little Too Far who was Trent's girlfriend and bestie to his step-sister, Lexie. If you've read the book you know what all came down. We also got a mixed feeling for Sam in that book, but now she has her own story. 
 So Sam has been kicked out of her home by her mother and has no job or a place to stay. Therefore she asked her friend Jonathan to stay with him and his roommate. He agrees but hooked her up at a gentlemen's bar (not to mistake it for a strip club) to pay for her share of the rent. 
 Sam obliges and gets the job dancing for the customers and so on. 
 But sparks starts to fly when she spots a Mysterious gentleman and once she got a called to dance privately for the Mysterious gentleman, she couldn't help herself but want to get under him and throw the rules over her head of no touching, close contact, and all those no nos with the customers. 
 So there are more private VIPs with Mr. Harrison Yates and some super sweaty hot scenes which, trust me, they were worth it! 
 But of course things aren't always what they seems and once Sam crossed that road of client and something more with Harrison, she threw herself into unknown territory with him. 
 Harrison as you may know has secrets and well, they are hug depending how you want to see it. They change the story dramatically which I love because it made the story even better! It's really hard not to love him. 
 I really love how Lisa once again got my mind and heart pounding! I couldn't put the book down and was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole read! And I also read it in One Whole Seating! Should I even say there was some suspense? I know I got that from the previous book but it really worked in this one! And the twists and turns!!! Oh man. I had to take a breather just to let everything settled in. Shall I say this was both before and after the turns of events?! 
 Every time I turned the pages I just get thrown in and out of feeling really tighten up with nervousness or holding my breath in....some kind of swooning senselessness! Harrison is just a God!! My goodness! 
 It actually got me thinking about working at a gentlemen's bar if I can find a man that Hot and Sexy! Wow! 
 And even though it was in the POV of Sam like all the other previous books with only the heroine's view, I didn't mind it but gosh how I would love to get into Harrison's head! 
 I also really loved the chemistry between Sam and Harrison. They have a really hot and great chemistry. Not just because they have a very different background but because their sex drive and hunger for each other was so strong and out of the world that I couldn't ignore it. Even from the very beginning it was there and not just because Sam was dressed skimpy in barely nothing or getting it down on the pole but man, I swear I could feel their sexiness oozing out of my Kindle! 
 I just got to say I didn't think Lisa can pull any thing up against Alessandro but man I was wrong. 
 Harrison is my sexy Hunk for this year's 'Gotta have that Hunky Hot Sex Abs'! I might even have to start that Meme after him. 
 Wow, I'm getting hot and giddy and you just have to pick this baby up when it releases! Thank you Lisa and the people at Harper Collins for giving me this opportunity to read this book!!! Phew. 
 But if you really want to know how this book made me feel, I suggest you watch Bruno Mars' Gorilla music video. Hot~!!!

4,"I loved it - even though it's long-ish and the main event comes really far in the book. But I specifically love the relantionship between Samantha and Jase. This is what a young relantionship should be like. And I also love how the author was able to perfectly describe household of the Garretts and still make you feel like you know each member of the family. (So much love, huh?)"
4,"I love Alice retellings. There are several happening in YA right now that are a bit meh for me, so I appreciated Christina Henry's adult take on the story. The darkness and characters remind me so much of American McGee's Alice and Alice the Madness Returns. Escaped from an asylum, Alice takes on the creatures from her nightmares. The plot even reads like a quest game with bosses. Love! While there are definitely fantastic and magical elements present, the villains are clothed as warring crime bosses in the Old City aka the bad part of town. Warning: there is lots and lots of violence against women, some told as flashbacks with others exposed as the plot progresses. Hard to read, for sure. Also lots of axe murder. All that said, I would love to play through this world in a video game. I hear there's a second book about the quest to find (view spoiler)[Hatcher's daughter (hide spoiler)], and I will definitely be on the lookout for its release next year."
3,Hated the ending.
4,"Other than the one MC being a bit too stupid at times, I really enjoyed this slightly new twist on shifter lore."
4,"Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy return to Narnia to help a young prince save the country from his evil uncle."
5,"Well hello Rebel! My aren't you distracting ... Although you must excuse me if Zeth is still in the room ... I may be drooling slightly. And what? Sloane is here too? Wow. Because I've never been turned on by a girl before, but she could honestly be the first. 
 This instalment was brilliant! And I am not even going to hesitate moving onto the next!"
