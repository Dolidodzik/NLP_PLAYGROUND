4,"Wow I'm so glad that I finished this. This book is so freaking short, and yet it took me ages to finish. The first few pages just throw all these names and info at you -your brain is just like: what the heck did I just read. Thankfully, it gets (somewhat) less confusing. 
 Book summarized in one sentence: A glamorous, wealthy, family -blinded by envy, and bitterness, with lots of manipulation, regret, and playing with fire. [you get it? hehe I'm so funny] 
 The Sinclair family is seemingly perfect. They're not allowed to be imperfect. Cadence Sinclair along with the three other ""liars"" are the sons and daughters and a ...spouse's sister's son of the three Sinclair Daughters. (does that mean that all of them are cousins? I'm not sure whoops) 
 The Aunts are crazy. They are resentful, greedy, and scheming. They use their kids to get what they want and frankly, their kids (plus Gat) are sick of it. So they try to do something about it. 
 The whole book revolves around Cadence who lost her memory after the ""incident"". The whole book is kinda her trying to recover her memories. Cadence is disorientated, she gets headaches, she needs medication. Honestly, I thought all that wasn't too big of a deal. The book is definitely more about the process of remembering and recovering. 
 The writing style didn't bug me as much as I thought it would. There was no structure, sometimes sentences will stop randomly, periods replaced commas. In my opinion, the way it was written added to the out-of-focus ambiance that worked well with the storyline. 
 I LOVED HER REVISED FAIRY TALES. I wish I was that creative ;-; 
 It does take a little while to get used to the writing though. For example: 
 Then he pulled out a handgun and shot me in the chest. I was standing on the lawn and I fell. The bullet hole opened wide and my heart rolled out of my rib cage and down into a flower bed. 
 It took me a moment to realize the main character didn't actually have a bullet lodged in her chest. 
 But still. I quite liked the format it was written. 
 NOW FOR THE ENDING: I can't say I'm surprised? I was anticipating this 'holy-shit-moment' or a 'WHY-THE-HECK-SDJAJSLKFJSDK-moment' It was kinda both. I was expecting, more specifically a 'it-was-all-just-a-dream-moment', and in a way I was sort of right. 
 I thought the ending was extremely fitting, and the purpose of the book was really well expressed. 
 ALSO: (view spoiler)[I'm still not clear about exactly how it worked. Were they ghosts? Was she imagining them the whole time she was there? Or was all of that a dream, and she woke up with answers? I'M STILL CONFUSEDDDD. (hide spoiler)]"
4,"While the piece does get a little heavy-handed from the heavy use of allegory ... this is a nice book and forms the basis of ideas (from a Christian perspective, along with Bach's ""Illusions"") that recently became the rage with ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" and ""The Secret."" I enjoy this one more than the other two."
4,"""Meeting your soul mate is like walking into a house you've been in before - you will recognize the furniture, the pictures on the wall, the books on the shelves, the contents of drawers: You could find your way around in the dark if you had to."" 
 I have mixed feelings about I'll Give You the Sun. I really liked the complexity of the characters but the writing style just wasn't my cup of tea. I enjoyed the story because of the characters and how I could feel their emotions but it was quite tough to fight through all the metaphors at times. I've never been a big fan of ""fancy"" writing; I don't think you need to write in a lavish way to tell a great story. With that being said, the characters and the themes did salvage the story a lot and I ended up really enjoying it. 
 The story is told through the perspective of twins Jude and Noah. Noah tells us his side of the story as a thirteen year old whilst Jude tells us hers from the age of sixteen. I thought this worked really well and it's interesting to see how their lives are different at these ages but also how they are still working through the same issues. 
 Jude and Noah used to be extremely close but jealousy and grief caused them to drift apart. We slowly learn about the events that caused their split (this is not a fast paced read) and the storytelling does a great job of letting the reader feel the emotions pouring from the characters. We feel their grief, their anger, their jealousy. The story also covers a lot of themes from friendship, family, love, LGBT and grief and each theme was covered in a beautiful way. 
 Overall, I'll Give You the Sun is a beautiful story but I wasn't a huge fan of the writing style. I would recommend for the complexity of the characters alone and the abundance of themes that are covered in a graceful way."

 I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY BUT I COULDN'T GET THROUGH IT, WHAT THE FRICK? :""""""o"
5,Death has an existential crisis. What more do you need?????????
4,"3.9 I really like this one, Keri is just OK, but the family is great and I love Joe so the make up for everything :)"
3,"Okaaaay, this getting really annoying. Maybe i should try something cute and back to YA teritory or just stop reading for a while. 
 Nah, thats just my issues. 
 The book it self is really good. Cute, sweet and anything u could say. But it happening too fucking fast. Just three days and Ben seem like hes head over heel to dave, and this is work both way and i cant really believe them at the first time, or its probably just me, u know bitching about this lmao. 
 But the sex, how can i say? Pretty hot. At least i have that, and i get to know about the sport too. And Eddie, oh yes, im not into bdsm-thing but hes so sweet, probably will read his own story in the future if im not sick with bdsm theme anymore my first bdsm novel are fifty shades of grey, u probably know how that series are really not good for the first impression for my own curiousity, so yeah 
 But i'm enjoyed the story, so 3 stars for this one."
4,"The story was pretty gripping. I had a hard time putting it down. I wasn't even particularly irritated by the constantly switching point of views. 
 I did find it odd that the only point of view not told was that of Kate, the ill sister on whom this entire story hinged. But then considering how Anna's testimony turned out -- it made more sense. 
 I thought I saw the end coming but did not. Let's just say that was a nasty, cheap, cheater ending and it really pissed me off. 
 Would recommend, but still angry even after a good cry. 
 I'd probably think twice before reading another book by this author, just in case that's the sort of thing she likes to do with endings. Grumble."
3,"This is one of those books that took me a while to get into but I enjoyed once I was involved. It isn't, however, standout enough for me to really ruminate on the beauty of the story or language and it's not infuriating enough or inept enough for me to rage about the book. It simply is and is there and is charming in its own way. I don't think it's something that will still for me for too long, but it was an enjoyable read/listen. 
 I do need to say that I genuinely, absolutely, completely loathed Rose. Mort, I eventually came to understand and somewhat care for but Rose, I essentially hated from beginning to end. I feel as though this is slightly unfair as the event on which this story hinges is a major event and its clear that Rose wasn't mentally well from the start, but still, I hated her. I hated how she essentially punished everyone else for an event which occurred, in part because of her decision and action."
4,"Initial thoughts after reading: THANK GOODNESS FOR AUTHORS WHO CAN WRITE GENUINELY GOOD-NATURED MEN AS LOVE INTERESTS. No, but for real. There is a dangerous trend in YA fiction where the men are snobby, self-righteous, crude, and just down-right abusive to their girlfriends. That type of attitude is somehow romanticized and made to feel all swoony and like the kind of relationship you would want anybody you care about to be in. Thankfully Amy Engal did not fall into that trap with our heroine's love interest and husband, Bishop. 
 The Book of Ivy follows a sixteen year old girl named Ivy as she is prepared to be married off to President Lattimer's son, Bishop. Following the end of a nuclear war, humanity was left to rebuild itself into the eight thousand people they have residing today. Two families, the Lattimer's and the Westfalls, had fought over who would seize power. The Lattimers had won, and set a tradition that each generation would hand over a female Westfall to become a wife to a Lattimer. But this isn't just an ordinary pairing. Ivy's been tasked by her father to kill the President's son, the first step towards a revolution and a switch in power. However, Ivy soon begins to question everything she's been taught when she learns how different Bishop is from what she expected. Bishop is kind and patient, and Ivy soon finds herself caught between her loyalties to her family and the connection she has with Bishop. 
 CAN I PLEASE GIVE THE AUTHOR A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR BISHOP. I said this in my 'initial thoughts' portion, but really. Two hands is not enough to count the number of books whose hero's abusive and toxic actions are glorified. Bishop is the opposite. He is charming, quiet, understanding, kind, and patient. He gives Ivy her space when they first meet, because he knows that the transition would be difficult for her. They hadn't even met before the wedding, for goodness sakes, so of course they would both be a little awkward and uncomfortable. He respects the fact that she isn't ready to have sex with him. He doesn't push her or the subject. He takes the time to get to know her, and goes out of his way to subtly show her (and the reader) that he cares and actually listens when she speaks. She loves strawberries? He comes back the next day with a lot of them, just for her. 
 I remind myself what his father's done. What he is still doing. But Bishop's touch is gentle, his intentions good. No matter how hard I look, I cannot find the blood on his hands. 
 The attraction between them is there from the beginning, but I appreciated how the author developed the trust slowly. It wouldn't make sense for her to be automatically in love with him when all she's heard about his family is bad. I like that they find common ground in coming from very lonely lives, deprived of real friendships. When she finally acknowledged these romantic feelings she's having for him, it felt true. It didn't feel forced. This makes her sacrifice at the end of the novel all the more heartbreaking. (view spoiler)[Not being able to kill Bishop nor let her family down, Ivy plants the poison where the cops can find it. She takes the fall and blame for her sister and father, and is therefore sentenced to the Fence. (hide spoiler)] 
 I really did not like Callie (which was the point, I think, so props to Engel). She was manipulative, and did not sympathize for her sister. She was power hungry and blood thirsty. WHAT WAS THAT ENDING? She was just really that willing to sell her sister out just so her butt was covered? I hope Callie gets whats coming to her in the next book. 
 Another thing I did like, however, is how she humanized the Lattimer family. You learn of a past love for the President, and the sacrifices he's had to make for the sake of the rules his family established. You don't agree with some of the things he's doing, but you can't help but sympathize for him when the truth about his and Ivy's dad's rivalry comes out. (view spoiler)[The President and Ivy's mom lived across the street from each other when they were kids and fell in love. They wanted to marry each other, but the President couldn't bend his own rules. They got married to other people but still loved each other. Ivy's mom hung herself, and Ivy's dad blamed the President. (hide spoiler)] My heart also broke a little bit for Bishop's mom, Erin. She knew that her husband was not in love with her, and she would never receive that kind of emotion from him. She could be rude at times to Ivy, but I respected how protective she was of her family. 
 I can't wait for the release of Ivy's sequel, The Revolution of Ivy. I hope Bishop and Ivy's reunion is glorious and cute and I hope he finally learns of how much she has sacrificed to save her family (who did not deserve her loyalty). Maybe they'll get to see the ocean together. 
 And it is Bishop who helped me break free. He didn't save me, though. He allowed me the freedom to save myself, which is the very best type of rescue."
4,"Lavie Tidhar builds a vision of the future which is neither idyllic nor bleak, but very real. In its world-building, Central Station is similar to William Gibson's Neuromancer though Gibson's characters and plots are more fun, or James S.A. Corey's The Expanse series. Tidhar uses his characters to explore notions of life and a life worth living if you are an Earther, a Belter, or a Martian; a robotic or a toaster; if you are a data vampire or disabled with no node to join the communal Conversation; if you are a god or a God builder; or if you are one of the Others, the alien life that we created in the digital universe where all evolution is heading. Tidhar is funny, too, as all appliances are sentient, a true Internet of Things with opinions. In many ways he tackles the same questions any really good science fiction does: what does it mean to be human? And then he goes beyond it."
4,"I loved this graphic novel. It was nothing like how I expected, it was better. There were so many stories and sometimes it was hard to keep of all the characters straight, but I love how they all wove in and out of each other until they finally connected. The artwork was fantastic too. Not your average graphic novel for sure. It is so deep; very religious themes dealing with the ideas of man vs. God and each other, what ""for the greater good"" really means, and so much more I probably missed. 
 ""At play with strangeness and charm."" 
 ""Because there is good and there is evil, and evil must be punished. Even in the face of eventual Armageddon, I shall not compromise this."" 
 ""We gaze continuously at the world and it grows dull in our perceptions. Yet seen from another vantage point, as if new, it may still take the breath away."""
3,"I enjoyed this volume. We got to see a less I AM EVIL Loki and more of the prankster Loki. I also like the new character, Karman (?). Although, it was really predictable with the end-game with him. But, it is fun to see Kamala grow, now that she has a better understanding of her powers. 
 The artwork was fun and I felt it really reflects Kamala's personality. The special SHIELD issue was fun to read, too! I am not as exposed to SHIELD and it was fun to read Kamala in a different situation. And the art for the next issue looks AMAZING."
5,"FIVE MOTHERLOVIN ROSE DESTRUCTING STARS 
 I am depressed. 
 Like seriously depressed. 
 Thats how amazing this book was ! 
 I empathized so well with Adelina that we are like total soul sis now. And man am i depressed. 
 Seriously, MARIE LU, I BOW TO YOU. 
 This has been one of the most amazingly realistic in a fantasy way with no sugar glaze on top book EVER. 
 I am like literally scared to read the next installment when ever it comes out cuz i am not sure my heart can bear it. 
 The climax, the romance, the magic, the drama, the blah di blah EVERYTHING was so FUCKING INTENSE. 
 Its like this book was ALL THE WAY ~~~~ 
 To every fantasy, paranomal, romance lover out there, i say ""Go and FOR THE LOVE OF GODS..... GET THIS DAMN BOOK AS YOUR NEXT READ"" . 
 Seriously, you should."
2,I was given this book in exchange for am honest review. Unfortunately I couldn't finish the book. First of all it was terribly slow and I had the hardest time even getting into it. Then I didn't like the characters or the story.
3,"Hmmm I don't know. Everyone is screaming how this book is perfect and I just can't agree. 
 After reading the first book and hating it I stopped critically reading this series. I read it for fun. It was an entertaining new adult. Saying that, this would've had a lower rating if I actually cared. 
 First of all, everything felt so damn f o r c e d. The whole Rhysand is a feminist thing. The attempt at representation. A lot of the interactions between the characters were like huh? I cringed at so many things 
 So REPETITIVE. Things and terms were repeated all the time, I wanted to beg them to stop. 
 And in result to that, it ended up being so boring. When I put it down, I had no inclination to pick it back up. I was just really excited about other books that I needed to read it and be done. 
 Am I the only one who thinks this whole ""mate"" thing doesn't make any sense. If we go by what they told us, even if I do love the person I'm currently with, if the bond clicks with someone else I'm all about my mate. wut 
 Phew. Here's 3 things I found enjoyable: 
 (view spoiler)[1. Nesta and Cassian were very entertaining. 
 2. The only time I was impressed with Maas' writing was with Tamlin. Don't shoot me. 
 3. Amren and Varian were also fun, even though we had like 3 pages of them. (hide spoiler)]"
0,"I love the title to the second book, this is one of my most anticipated (sequel) reads for this year along with a few others of course."
2,"I have some conflicting feelings about this book. 
 The good stuff first: it is crammed with really good action scenes. The aerial combat scenes in particular, are a very nice variant on the traditional piratical exploits on water, and extremely well executed. 
 Butcher has added nice new elements to a familiar background and made the whole into something genuinely fresh. the background in question, is something like a Victorian-era society. In this world however the Earth's surface is toxic and everybody lives above the clouds, in some monumental ""spires"" scattered around the globe, built long ago by we don't really know who. Possibly some kind of apocalypse occurred and we are looking at our own far future. This civilization also knows a form of magic: crystals, of an indeterminate nature, which allow such feats as energy production and even anti-gravity. They power the flying vessels which are seemingly the only real means of locomotion, commerce and warfare. 
 So far, so good. But then we have to talk about the cast. After some reflection I have come to the conclusion that they are all basically Anime characters. That's not necessarily all bad, but... They are archetypes with very little complexity. There's the honorable captain, the eccentric old magician, the young warrior, the simple girl with a big heart, the spoiled noble brat who's secretly a nerd... Ditto, the villains. Don't get me wrong, as far that goes they are all actually rather well done and likable. I'm just picturing them all on screen with Japanese dubbing with no effort at all. 
 And then there's the cats. Cats talk, you see, at least to those few who can listen. And they have cat opinions, and do cat things, and we get to know all about it. It's cute for the first 20 pages but it turns out that there is, in fact, a limit to the amount of cat point-of-view witticism even I can take without strain. 
 And this is why I added the novel to my ""Young-Adult"" shelf, despite the serious gore to which one is otherwise exposed. I can't take this all fully seriously. The Cinder Spires is fun, it's bubbly, it's great action. It should come with a free lollipop or some pop corn."
1,God knows why I even bother trying to read these books....
4,"I read this because I'm wanting to watch the movie, and I always like to read the book first. It has a lot of historical information and facts. People really into that time period will probably love that. The action and survival were the parts that grabbed me. It was absolutely amazing how much he survived. He was attacked by a bear and left for dead by his group. The men who were suppose to stay with him until he died actually took all of his supplies. He survives the winter in the wilderness with no tools, weapons, materials or food except what he can find while suffering life-threatening injuries. Then he travels for hundreds of miles through unsafe territories surviving all kinds of hazards including people trying to kill him while still injured (enough to not leave bed for most of us). According to the author, most of the story is true. I can't wait to see the film."
5,"I did not expect The Rose Society to be this amazing. Everyone told me that it was, both on Goodreads and in my social circle, but I took their reviews with a grain of salt because it's so hard to trust reviews anymore, especially with sequels. I was terrified it was going to suffer the same 'second-book syndrome' as so many other great series' do. I was so wrong. 
 The Rose Society was everything I wanted and needed in a sequel. While The Young Elites was enjoyable and entertaining, The Rose Society took everything the first book had done and made it better. The Rose Society was a fast-paced, adrenaline fueled story. I was floored. My brain could not comprehend anything after I finished reading the book. 
 The novel picks up a few weeks after the conclusion of The Young Elites. Adelina and her sister Violetta have fled Kenettra and wander the streets of nearby countries searching for other Young Elites to join Adelina's new society and army of allies. Adelina has only one goal: to destroy the Inquisition Axis that ruined her life ... and to seize control of the throne of Kenettra for herself. Teren Santoro, the leader of the Inquisition, wants her dead and her old friends at the Dagger Society want to stop her quest for vengeance. Adelina tries to cling to the good inside of her, but her powers, which feed off of fear, have begun to grow out of control. Through her reputation as the feared White Wolf, Adelina has gained control of an army of mercenaries and plans to infiltrate the royal palace and take what she believes is rightfully hers. 
 Adelina has quickly become one of my favourite YA characters. In The Young Elites she was clearly set up as the antihero, but in The Rose Society she develops into a fully-fledged villain and I love her for it. We are privy to her innermost thoughts which seethe in darkness, anger and occasional bouts of insanity. Despite this, Adelina is definitely a sympathetic character and one you can't help but like, even taking into consideration all she has done and plans to do. At the end of the day, Adelina is still a young girl with fantasises of a life-long romance and loving friendships; Marie Lu has a way of reminding us of this, even amidst Adelina's darkest scenes. 
 Raffaele frightened me in this novel. I still love him, but the reader is introduced to a darker, more powerful side of him. He so easily bends people to his will through his power and it is clear he has the ability to take over the world if he so desires. Raffaele, at least for me, is presented as the direct opposite of Adelina: they both feed off emotions, but while Adelina's are based in fear and darkness, Raffaele's are sourced from desire and light. He very well could turn into Adelina one day, if he longs for further power. But that there is the main difference between them: Raffaele knows when to stop, while Adelina, especially as the final scenes of the novel show, doesn't. 
 My new favourite character is Magiano. He is the first Young Elite Adelina recruits into her society and his relationship with her is fueled with tension and longing. I really enjoyed how dedicated he is to Adelina and his eagerness to watch her rise to power. However, their slow-burning romance is placed in the background of the story, which I heartily approve of. I want this story to focus on Adelina's rise to power and not be subsumed into that YA cliche of romance driving and taking over the plot. That definitely doesn't happen here, and I am so thankful that Lu focuses on the right thing. Still, I hope that Magiano and Adelina find a way to be together, although I suspect Adelina will follow the same course as Elizabeth I of England: unmarried and completely focused on her throne. 
 I really enjoyed Teren's character in The Young Elites, but he started to annoy me in the sequel. His personality is incredibly complex and sometimes I struggle to connect with him as he is so pious and stubborn. That being said, I think he is a great villain in a novel with a villain as the protagonist. His actions at the conclusion of the novel were gut-wrenching to read, even though I was rooting Adelina on. I look forward to finding out what becomes of him in the last novel of the series. 
 The novel's plot was simply incredible. There was not one moment where I wasn't perched on the edge of my seat, reading in morbid fascination. I can guarantee that no one will see anything coming. Lu has definitely discovered her calling in dark fantasy and I hope she honours us and continues writing in this genre. What I loved most about this novel is how dark it was. I have never experienced a novel quite like this before: yes, many YA books deal with dark themes, but not in the same way as The Rose Society does. Adelina wants ultimate power; she wants revenge against the people who ruined her life and won't stop until she has destroyed them. But Adelina has also ruined her enemies' lives in the process and Lu doesn't even apologise for Adelina's actions. That's what makes this YA novel different from others. Adelina wants what she wants and won't allow her conscience - or what society thinks is the 'right thing' - to stop her. 
 Marie Lu's writing perfectly matched the tone and pace of the novel. Her words flow which makes the storyline compelling and addictive. The novel flows naturally and that makes it just that more believable, especially when we read Adelina's thoughts. You can't help but agree with Adelina even as she is contemplating doing a terrible thing. That's how captivating Lu's writing is: she has you agreeing with a villain. 
 The novel doesn't end on a cliff-hanger and everything is tied up quite nicely. That being said, the final chapter was revelatory and astounding. I had to put the book aside for a good ten minutes as I experienced a wide range of emotions: I was shocked, excited, scared and unsettled. I can't wait for the final book in the trilogy The Midnight Star to be released. I need to know what will happen for Adelina next!

4,"The book was really good though I was quite dissappointed with some of the developments. Still, the book was worth it and so were Kelsea Glynn and The Mace- I really loved these two characters."
3,"""There are no guarantees in life. No proof that will ensure you're making the right decision. Sometimes, you just have to hold your breath and jump. And hope you land on your feet unscathed."" 
 an interesting tale that deals with some tough issues. Parent that is a teacher having inappropriate relationships with students, suicide, pornography - there's a lot in here. And I thought the main characters were interesting. The mystery was enough to hold my attention even if I thought the bad guy was easy to spot. 
 I did find some of the conversations a little distracting. Words like ""exact revenge"" and that something is ""evident"" or the ""backdrop""....I just didn't find those words credible words teenagers would use. I also (view spoiler)[ didn't buy that Cece would have stayed at a school where her mother was thought to have had an inappropriate relationship with one of the students. At the very least, she would have moved schools or started home schooling. There is no way she'd stay there (hide spoiler)] but if you suspend your belief on that long enough, the story was well done and I enjoyed it."
4,"3.5 stars. One of the best opening sentences ever! An action packed, terrorist, zombie, co-op government series. I enjoyed it. The character are well written and likable. It was really heavy on the police/military stuff, which got a little dull for me, as I don't really care about the specifics. It had a good story line that kept me interested."
4,"I feel like I just found a dancing unicorn that led me to the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. A New Adult book that isn't just tortured-bad-boy-falls-for-ordinary-bland-heroine!?!? What, don't believe me? I'm not sure I believe me either and I actually read the book lol. 
 The one thing keeping me from droning on and on about how glad I am for this spark of uniqueness in the sea of NA sameness is that I hate trying to type missives on my iPad. But know that this book has finally answered one of my most fervent gripes with NA: it tackles something other than bad-boy-meets-virgin love. It addresses one of the other seven million things that can happen to you in college. The fact that it manages to be so totally engrossing is just the cherry on top. That it shines a real light on how dangerous addiction can be, and at a time when a high tolerance of any kind of drug is seen as ""cool"" is just too good to be true. 
 Turns out this book is going to be a series. And as though not enough magic has happened, not only do I plan to read the series, but I even hope they do the new trend and tell the story from Lo's POV. I told you guys, this book is a dancing unicorn! 
 Rather than a cookie cutter formulaic romance, what we have here is a story about two real people who have actual fucking problems. Not plot devices, but problems! Addicted to You is about two best friends battling addiction, her to sex and him to alcohol. And not in a lightweight one-look-from-you-and-I'll-be-cured way. They have truly self-destructive lifestyles which they can't seem to get out of. And they think by enabling one another, somehow they can manage to keep each other from falling off the deep end. So she checks on him every night to make sure he's laying on his side after he passes out, and stays sober most nights so she can be his designated driver. Meanwhile he makes sure she gets home in one piece after her one night stands, and takes her to the health clinic regularly. This is their version of functioning. No matter that he can't go more than a hour or so without a drink, and she hides from her family rather than have to be in a stuck in a place where she has to pretend to be thinking about anything other than sex. No matter that they have no friends but each other and are barely passing their classes. They are doing okay. 
 As you can imagine, they are not doing okay, and things get progressively worse instead of better. Lily is at first difficult to unspderstand. Since she knows she's being selfish, you kind of want to go ""hey stop fucking around and go be a good friend"". Even though it's told from her POV, it takes a while to really understand how trapped she is; she seems just kind of selfish at first. And then there is Lo. Who is so obviously drowning in depression and addiction you want to jump into the book and save him, even when he is being a rat bastard by telling Lily that he will choose the bottle over her. He is a tragic character whose spite is caused by alcohol and a really really horrible upbringing, but somehow you know that he isn't really that person (and now I sound like a fangirl swooning over some detestable Patch/Travis/Kellan type, but just trust me on this; the Ritchies do a phenomenal job of separating the person from the addiction, and for that alone you should read this book) 
 Lily knows she should do more to help Lo, but that would mean risking the safety net underneath her own addiction, so she rationalizes, and compromise. Lo can't help her, in turn, because it would mean having to put down the bottle to accurately express how her actions hurt him. Neither of them wants to be a hypocrite for telling the other to stop or seek help, and neither is ready to even entertain the idea of giving up their vice, so they find ""a system"". Even though it is clear that they love each other, their relationship is built on fear and mutually assured destruction. 
 And in all of that lies the power of the book. It paints a heartbreakingly real picture of addiction, and the helplessness in which unfortunately a lot of people drown. Knowing you're making the wrong decision, and being able to do anything about it are two different things. And so we watch these two people flail, only barely able to keep their heads above water, totally unable to save themselves, or each other. It hurts to read, but it's impossible to stop. 
 3.5 stars, because it wasn't the tightest book I've ever read. But honestly, after the first few pages, the story and the characters are so captivating you stop noticing. 
 I received a free copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for my honest, unbiased review

4,"Okay, why is it when Curran's around, my panties get on fire?! There's something so smexy about that dude. Kate, we can switch places... I wouldn't mind at all, oh no. ;D"
2,"I started to really get into this book, i actually started to forgive Stephenie Meyer for unleashing the Twilight pandemic upon the world, i even began to empathise with the characters. 
 Then she trots out the same tired, childish, sappy plot device and suddenly i want to scream in frustration. 
 I forced myself (with a lot of swearing) to finish this tripe and i've got to admit it does not get any better. 
 If Twilight annoyed don't bother with this one either."
5,"Each book in this trilogy has deepened my respect for Rae Carson's ability as a story teller. 
 Elisa is my favorite kind of character -- one who grows and learns with her choices. She constantly has to choose between bad and worse, and there are always consequences. Elisa is deadly capable. Not in a she can slit your throat kind of way (though she certainly could), but in a she is ten times smarter than you and has common sense too. 
 But my favorite thing about Elisa? She cares so deeply for people. Not just her friends. Not just her family. Not just her subjects. While she cares deeply and intensely for them, she also cares for the inhabitants of her world as a whole. She rarely thinks in terms of ""us"" vs ""them."" She sees a bigger picture beyond what most people see. She not only thinks about the right now, next year and thirty years, she thinks generations down the road, and she's not afraid to upset those closer to her to create a hope for that future at the cost of the immediate. 
 Elisa has taken her place in my list of favorite bad-ass heros."
2,"I'm just glad this is over. 
 Pro: better than hunger games in terms of third unnecessary books; ending was semi decent; you could tell this was the authors favourite part. 
 Con: BAD writing; way too much useless filler writing in between events with no details; too long of an ending; was bored. 
 Compared to the first two it seems that this is what she really wanted to write but honestly I don't think it should have been three books... Not enough depth for that. Quality of writing improved compared to the first two but I think that's indicative of the fact the author was excited to finally tell us this part. Plot was average. Will likely make a decent movie. Eh."
4,"I was just as in to this story as I was Bad Romeo. I only wish I would have gotten to this one a little sooner b/c time sure did make me forget some things. 
 Broken Juliet has the same back and forth, past and present like BR. For this story it was for sure needed and again appreciated. It was tough to go through the things Ethan put Cass through. You could tell they would be perfect together but Ethan and is brain just kept refusing to let them be great. 
 This was for sure a journey and the redemption was sweet."
4,This is the third book in the series. I still like Rule the best but this one comes in as a close second.
4,"Ok ok ok, so 4 stars... I was actually aiming for 5 but the end really bugs me! 
 I loved the triangle Denny & Kiera & Kellan and I could mostly sympathize with her dough or lack of self knowledge though most part of the book. 
 Kellan, of course, is my ideal fictional bad boy! Denny is the ultimate good guy but his workaholic personality annoyed me a lot. 
 Before reading the book I read a review that literately said, ""hates of twilight, 50 shades and beautiful disaster, run, this book is worst"" and just buy reading this simple phrase I knew I would love every moment of it!!! 
 (view spoiler)[And to a point I really, really did... Than it all felt! Really, did she honestly expected to be with the two of them for a while? And please, your boyfriend is in the next room, have some respect!!! You been with him forever... You say you love him... Really, I wanted to jump in the book and hit her. 
 I really though some of the last chapters where too much... She keep changing her mind so much, that was really exhausting and I hope in the next books she has to prove her love! (hide spoiler)] 
 Really enjoy reading!"
2,"The worst book in the series by far. I only give one star reviews to books I don't finish, but this one was close to getting one. 
 But with only one book left in the series, I will keep on keeping on."
4,"Just placed my order for this one. I am so excited to read it!!! 20/8 
 I want more! When is the next one out??? :)"
4,"Interesting take on the zombie genre, although that's probably not quite a fair statement. The dead start rising, but unlike the flesh eating zombies we're used to, they seem to be very similar to who they were before they died. Or are they? 
 Compelling storyline with characters that are a little more fleshed out than you'd expect from a horror comic, but after Walking Dead that's probably not a fair statement either. 
 There's a lot going on here and it's not all easy to keep straight, but hopefully things will start to make sense in later volumes. I have read some of them before, but I'm starting over at the beginning before catching up to the volumes I've already read."
2,"DNF, I would write more of my opinion if I didn't feel like crap right now. *sigh* and maybe thats why I just don't have the patience for the H or this book right now."
5,"So glad I finally got round to reading this. Night School wasn't at all the book I was expecting -- for some reason, I was convinced it was paranormal, and the school's secret was going to be along the lines of 'half the students are angels/demons/shape-shifters'. Once I realised I had the genre wrong, I was much more intrigued. I sped through Night School, eager to solve its various mysteries, and will be getting my hands on book two ASAP."
3,It was a fun audiobook.
5,Best book in the trilogy!
4,"I'd like to give this one 3.5 stars but I'll be nice and round up. I couldn't put this book down, I literally read straight through it, adult responsibilities be damned, and because of that I want to give it a higher rating...but I just can't. In the back of my head there's a little voice nagging me about the romanticizing of Travis' overly-possessive stalker tendencies. Chapter one is entitled ""Red Flag"" and that is exactly what I was mentally yelling at Abby throughout the book. She fell for his antics every time and, what's worse, I wanted her to! So, I'm left feeling conflicted but I still enjoyed it enough to start Walking Disaster today. Here's hoping that seeing things from Travis' POV will redeem him."

 So I was looking around in the library and happened to see the title of this book. As I picked it up the title was what caught my eye to flip to the back when I realized it was about a teen suicide I figured I would give it a read. 
 Now this story goes back and forth between Clay and Hannah though this is Hannah talking through a recording. You see she left tapes that are to be mailed to those that are on a list of hers each person who is on that list is to hear her voice and understand what caused her to end her life. I loved how the author did it old school and had this put on cassette tapes. 
 Hannah seems like a normal girl but you never really know how a person is unless you truly truly know them and even then you may not know what is going on within their head. 
 I could totally relate with Hannah in a way where rumors that are started give you a reputation that isn't good and there is no way that you can tell them the truth on what really happened as everyone has their mind set to listen to the rumor. It sucks that Hannah had an experience like that because she seemed like a nice girl who would rather just stay to herself and have a close knit of friends. 
 Clay poor thing he has a crush on Hannah but never could quite talk to her so for him to have to listen to this and deal with was sad. 
 One thing I didn't understand with Hannah was the fact that instead of confronting one character for what he did she just added more things for him to have on her and kept the rumor mill going. I would have at least spoke to my parents or the police in that matter because that is something serious. 
 I see this as a good book for teens to read as it deals with a hard topic and that kids should reach out if you are thinking of suicide. Also speak up for those that are being pushed around by those that are your peers stand up for what you believe is right.

3,I just was not interested in this book. I gave up.
5,"This book was fabulous. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about it as it had everything I could want in a book. I am already a big fan of Steivfater's books, but the writing style in this one is a little different than some of her others and I think that even those that weren't fans of Shiver will still really like this one. 
 The characters are great. Blue is so practical and adorable you can't help but love her. And the boys are all complex and have a lot of layers to them so you just want to read more about each of them to learn their backgrounds and why they are who they are. 
 The story line is really interesting and made this book hard to put down. This was one of those stories that I wish I could live in and be a part of with the characters. The interactions between the characters are great and give the story so much depth. There were quite a few surprise moments in the book which made it even more entertaining. 
 I can't wait to read the next book. For anyone that has read her other books, you must read this one. But I would also recommend this to readers who like well written YA paranormal books. I think if you liked The Diviners then this would also be a good book for you."
4,"I really enjoyed this book which kind of surprised me because the plot was just silly and there were a lot of holes and unanswered questions and let's face it the bad guys were seriously stupid at times. However, I've decided that this book was more about the characters and their growth and I do love that. 
 I loved getting to see Ty interact with his family and to learn a bit more about him as a character. Both Ty and Zane can drive me crazy - not only do they not cop to how they feel about each other to themselves but they have some major communication issues and really don't talk about their feelings at all. However, I also find this really believable. I know a lot of guys (and some women too) who hate to talk about how they feel and with two guys who are FBI agents (one a marine) that's actually something I would expect. (Although minor point that bothered me was that Zane admitted to the serial killer in book 1 that he was in love with Ty so the backslide in this book was weird - where did that come from). This book Ty was ready to admit it but Zane was all nope I'm not in love with him.) That would be okay if it was something verbal but at least to himself he admitted it (since he did in book 1). 
 So like I mentioned the plot was silly and OTT but I guess it moved some of the story along and gave Zane a chance to impress Earl a bit. I could talk about the inconsistencies in the plot and the unanswered questions but I won't go there. Although silly this gave Zane and Ty a chance to interact together and grow closer. 
 I loved the ""softer"" moments between the two of them and I loved all the interactions with Ty's brother Deacon. Obviously not a fan of Earl. These two characters can be such a train wreck but for some reason I really like them and I will definitely keep reading this series. 
 If it only had a believable and well crafted plot it would be a 5 star read."
4,"I flew through this novel - really enjoyable. Set in a future where humans joined an interstellar Confederation to fight the Others (first book really doesn't give them much detail - they're just bad guys), the main character Staff Sergeant Torin Kerr has to a new 2nd LT to break in, and has a diplomatic mission to shoot up. The military (Marine) environs and dialogue are pretty believable. Some of it definitely reminded me of 
 Generation Kill 
 , in which I've always enjoyed its dark humor. 
 But I could have used a little less pastel-haired di'Taykan elves, and more snake-tongued Silsviss shenanigans. Mostly more Cri Sawyes."
3,"I found the ""book conservator"" storyline fascinating ... my little bro is super talented and looking for a job in the field. 
 Apparently this story is loosely based on a real medieval Jewish illustrated text that mysteriously made it through a Nazi invasion. So that's cool. 
 Some scenes I could have done without. But they were quickly skipped over."
5,"This was a game to Madoc--but it was a war to me. 
 But what-the-fuck-ever. That ship between us sailed long ago, 
 and there was no way she'd redeem the damage she'd done. 
 Rival has too much energy. The Characters gives off too much energy that sometimes I can't keep up. It starts off tough and it ended tough. Most books that has this kind of theme has some trouble in the middle of the story mainly because they can't keep the angst and banters till the end of the story so, I was impressed when the author pulled this book through. I'm not saying it's really the best but I feel like The first two books stood out more than this one. 
 ""You've always wanted me. You know why? 
 Because I don't try to kill your demons. I run with them."" 
 The book is written in an alternating POV's with heavy scenes and steamy sex. The story is about Madoc, Jared's best friend, and his stepsister Fallon who went away and 2 years after came back seeking for revenge. It was only a matter of time until true intensions were revealed, annoying parents gets involved, hard to accept facts gets out of the bag and feelings starts to take over Fallon and Madoc's life. What surprised me most in this book is when they got Hitched and how they cope with it. 
 Now, I knew more, and I knew what I wanted. 
 I wasn't afraid of taking it and taking chances. 
 Fallon, when things got bad she didn't get the say in things. There were a lot of reasons why she came back to Madoc's life. A lot of questions she wanted to ask him. But she came back mostly because she loves him. She was forced by her mother to do a lot of things she didn't want but now she wanted to stand up for herself and she wants Madoc's to suffer. At least that was what she planned but things has its own plans. 
 ""Madoc has no idea who he is."" 
 He was bad. And someday his looks would fade, 
 and whoever he ended up with would just have someone bad. 
 I had to remind myself of that. 
 There was nothing in him that I should want. 
 Madoc, he's an ass. I've read a lot of hero's who are just like him. An Ass. He parties, gets laid, races and hangs out with his two best friends, Tate and Jared, like he has no care in the world but deep inside he's broken. 2 years after Fallon left he had changed and when she came back he was like a 16 years old boy again. He's trying to prove something, at least that was what I have gathered on the first parts of the book while he was torturing and bantering with Fallon. Both of them doesn't even realized they want the same thing for each other. 
 He knew he could do what he wanted, when he wanted, 
 and if a girl didn't like it, 
 another one would come along to replace her. 
 I love the story but something was really off at times. In the end I have concluded that Madoc was whipped that was why he was being a girl towards Fallon. And Fallon, well, I liked her. She has this motto and she possess independence. Fallon was also trying to prove some thing in the story but most of the time I felt her, I felt her more than the first heroin in this series, Tate. I felt more connected to her. And I love it when a character gives me excitement. 
 To the Author whom I believed had done a great job with this book, Congratulations. Actually this story isn't really behind the first, they are both in the same line, its just that Jared's story was more appealing to me. Of course this book deserves the 4.5 stars. The storyline was great and the banters were fun to read. This is one of my favorite series so far so, I expect nothing less."
5,"""Sometimes I feel like we're a knot, too tangled to be taken apart."" 
 This was not as entertaining as the first part, but it dealt with much bigger issues and the story was not so predictable, so I fount it actually better than The Selection. Still, there were some cheesy parts, but there wasn't so many of them as I would expected. Honestly, I am kind of impressed with this series. I care for these characters. Well done, Kiera Cass. 
 4,5/5"
5,"The opening of this book in St Malo in 1944 at the start of a major raid by Allied forces is very powerful. The writing from the start has an intimacy and conveys a real sense of the oppressive feel of the raid. I found myself hooked by this tale very quickly indeed. The majority of the story concerns Marie-Laure, a blind French girl, and Werner, an orphaned German boy from their early years. The eras in the book do go back and forth however the changes are well signposted and generally quite some time is spent in each era of the story. The tale contained here is gently but persistently woven gradually revealing more and more about both the characters and the times they live in both prior to and during the war. 
 I found myself completely engaged with both of the main characters in this book. Marie-Laure's story of blindness, her father's devotion to her and their escape to St Malo from an occupied Paris was so compelling I really did find it hard to put down at times. Their stay in St Malo again was powerfully drawn in the well crafted words. Werner's tale of being in a children's home with his sister and his growing up was wonderfully portrayed too. However the more minor characters were also well drawn and fleshed out too and integral to the overall tale. 
 In the latter stages the story becomes ""edge of the seat"" stuff and very hard to put down. The inherent bleakness of war is almost tangible at times the writing was of such a high standard. In a sense this is a book about ""quests"" as all the main characters are seeking something. In general I've not read many ""prize winning"" books considering that the hype often seemed greater than the story - that is not the case for this book. A powerful and extremely well written tale. 
 Disclosure - I received an advance copy of this book from the publisher."
1,"I know it's many people's favorite, including my sister's, but I just couldn't get into it. Maybe it was because I was forced to read it and dissect it and study it in class? I might go back one day and reread it just for pleasure, but I highly doubt that happens. Isn't it sad when classes ruin books that way? Oh well, as I was saying, I just didn't enjoy this book at all. Sad idea though, that books would be burned in the future."
5,"Oh wow! 
 Though my first thought when I saw words 'The End' was NOOOOOOOOOO!!! 
 I need more!!! Tony's POV? There can never be enough of that!!! 
 I Hate to Love him and I Love to Hate him! <- that describes my emotions towards him the best at the moment.. 
 Wow, I can't seem to stop repeating that! I didn't know what to expect.. cause seriously, how can you expect something from him? Actually you can expect everything and nothing at the same time! That's Anthony Rawlings, polished on the outside - totally unpredictable inside! 
 And since the inside of my head feel suspiciously like scrambled eggs at the moment I don't think I can write a worthy review for this wonderful book! 
 I'd just start babbling ( like right now ) and fangirling, I may even start crying and that's never a good idea. 
 So let's all pray for the next reading companion to come along fast ( pretty please Aleatha!!!), so I'd be able to compose myself a little and live my life again. Or not. Actually keep them coming, more books, more POV's! I'd even like to read it from Catherine's POV.. I'm just kidding, I'd stab the bitch! 
 Anyway, me done. 
 Peace, 
 A. 
 P.S. In case I forgot to mention, this Book is AWESOME! If you haven't yet, you should check The Consequences series by Aleatha Romig. This is the 4th book. LOVE YOU ALEATHA! 
 P.P.S. yup, like I said.. I started fangirling.. here goes the waterworks!"
4,this little book BROKE MY HEART
3,"NetGalley. Thanks for the copy. 
 Did I Mention I Love You? is the first book in the DIMILY trilogy. That trilogy's name will be the death of me. I intensely dislike acronyms. It involves caps lock and/or the shift. But let's get back on track here. 
 Eden has dreams of LA's wonderfulness. As someone from LA, I'm too familiar with this wonder about the amazing Hollywood land. Take it from me. I have seen Hollywood too many times to count on all my hands, and the movies always, always make it look much more glamourous than it really is. It's like the China effect. After looking at Chinese characters for too long, you get bored of Confucius' home. Did I Mention I Love You? portrays LA more glamourous than it really is. 
 Drugs. Alcohol, weed, and even coke shows up in this book. I'm surprised by the absurd amount of it, and I don't recall SoCal being a drug-filled environment. Readers may feel alienated by the in-your-face presence of it. I certainly am. 
 Tyler. Tyler Bruce. He is (unfortunately) the love interest of Eden. On drugs, moody, and intolerable, Tyler acts and is the most typical male teenager. Okay, that isn't right. He is worse than the typical brooding male hero. I don't know exactly what Eden sees in him (at first), but I can't deny that he has good chemistry with her. Girls really dig bad boys, eh? But seriously. This guy needs years, years of therapy. 
 Despite the drugs and the amount of alcohol and partying, the plot is really worth paying attention to. Seeing Tyler and Eden's romance unfolds is amazing along with monitoring Tyler's character development. He does change. 
 The cast of Did I Mention I Love You? makes me facepalm a bit. ""To alcohol poisoning,"" exclaims one such character. Oh, dear... I pray for these poor souls. 
 As awesome as the plot and romance (I admit it! It is pretty cool, but I don't like Tyler in the beginning), the ending is really the selling point. That epilogue makes me scream. I'm not amused, Estelle Maskame! 
 In conclusion, Did I Mention I Love You? is in between the territory of ""no, I don't want to read this again"" and ""yes, this is an awesome book."" Some moments make this book worthy while other parts make me run for the woods. I'm really torn over this, but in the end, I do want to see what happens next.

4,Really enjoyable. At least as entertaining as the first in the series.
5,"Andrea and Raphael are two of my absolute favorite characters in the KD universe, loved this one so much! Loved Roman too, he is hilarious and very sweet, such a character! I hope we get more from Andrea's point of view, I like reading about their world through her eyes, and it is fun to have an outside view of Kate. Is there a bromance equivalent word for girls? Because I adore the friendship she + Kate share, it's magic! Enchanting mystery in this one, highly recommended reading!"

1,"When I saw this book as one of the kindle daily deals, I had a little mental debate with myself about it. 
 Me: Hey, it's about modern day pirates! And it's available on kindle unlimited. Why not give it a whirl? 
 Myself: Because it probably, sucks. Life is too short for stupid books. 
 Me: But it might be fun-stupid! How bad can it possibly be? C'mon...pirates! 
 Myself: Well, I guess I could try a couple of chapters.... 
 Me: That's the spirit! You might even like it. 
 Well, I should have listened to myself, because I really didn't enjoy this novel. I finished it mostly because it's a short, fast read, and I just skimmed the sex scenes, which made it even shorter. The story is about Indigo, a young woman who decides to flee her abusive ex-boyfriend by taking a yacht to England with her platonic bestie, Eric. When the yacht catches fire, they are kidnapped by pirates. Hendrix, the pirate captain, decides to sell her as a sex slave to pay off a debt. Not liking this idea in the slightest, Indigo decides to seduce him in the hopes that he will change his mind. 
 My first clue as to how silly this thing is was when Indigo first spots the pirates--on their wooden ship, with a black skull and crossbones flag, and some of them armed with swords. Yes, these are supposed to be modern day pirates. My second clue was Indigo's first reaction to Hendrix. While they are being captured, and she's terrified out of her mind, she can't help but ramble on at length about how impossibly beautiful and captivating and dazzling he is. Actually, that's his most important characteristic, as I never did get much idea about his personality or interests or anything else. But he sure is good to look at. 
 I was actually leaning towards a two star rating until the second half of the book, because the pirate shenanigans were slightly amusing. But then the book became annoying, for three main reasons: 
 1. Holy coincidences, Batman, let's kill any willing suspension of disbelief I might have had. (view spoiler)[The pirate that Hendrix owes a debt to just happens to be Indigo's long-lost father, whom she hasn't seen since childhood! Her abusive ex-boyfriend manages to track her down on a remote island in just one day! (hide spoiler)] 
 2. In one scene, Hendrix kills a half a dozen innocent men in cold blood, and apparently Indigo is completely cool with that and we are still supposed to think of Hendrix as a good person. What??? 
 3. Everybody has to have such an improbably tragic backstory. And then after suffering from abuse and/or killing someone in self defense, they do what all right-thinking people do...and take to a life of crime on the high seas. Which leads me back to problem #1. 
 I read in another review that the author apparently described this story as a motorcycle gang on the high seas, which explains a lot. If that sounds like a fun idea, then you might end up enjoying this more than I did, although personally, I wish I'd listened to myself on this one and just skipped it.

4,"***This review has also been posted on Xpresso Reads 
 Holy shit. THIS BOOK GUYS. Allegedly was one of my most anticipated books, but my co-worker who read it before I had a lot of FEELS (not good or bad, just FEELS), so I was a little nervous when I dove in. I had no idea the book would grip me and NOT LET ME GO. I read the 373 page book in a little over 2.5 hours. I GOBBLED IT, all while growing more and more anxious as I could feel something B.I.G. coming. 
 This book treads all the fine lines ever. There is no easy black and white in this book and it goes to lengths to make sure YOU KNOW THAT TOO. Justice, family, life cannot be put into little boxes and Jackson really explores what is right and wrong in this book. Is justice so easily served? Why is it that we as a society are always trying to figure out the one truth, are always trying to figure out the right and wrong while never focusing on the gray regions. What makes someone innocent? Who do we believe? Whose narrative is actually worth believing? 
 Mary B. Addison killed a baby. 
 Allegedly. 
 And yet we the readers have to really figure out the puzzle that is Mary B. Addison. I learned and unlearned a lot as I was reading a book and it was quite the emotional journey. 
 Allegedly is a confusing book because we only see things through Mary who we don't even know we can for sure trust. Mary, who has experienced the world in ways none of us probably have and would have had to toughen up even if she wasn't already tough. 
 Through bits and pieces, through flashbacks and testimonies, we learn more and more about what the real Mary might be like, the one that lies beneath the one she presents as. Mary is a complex, almost four dimensional character, and pops out through the pages. She forces you to pay attention to her and Jackson does an amazing job in crafting her character. 
 I do have two major criticisms of the novel though. My first being that I wish the secondary characters were better. I wish they weren't as two dimensional. I wish they had more depth to them so I could see the contrasts between Mary and them. That isn't to say Allegedly doesn't have some great secondary characters but I wish there was more depth to the other girls in the group home. I wish we got to see more of Mary's interactions with them (whether they were good or bad.) I just wanted to see MORE. 
 My other criticism is things I WILL NOT TALK ABOUT because spoilers but hopefully, other people might not be as frustrated as I was. I do want to be vague for a second and see that I can see what the author was trying to do with that one thing but I feel like it could have been executed in a way that would have allowed her to still do that thing but also wouldn't have felt so rushed. 
 There is such wonderful tension throughout this book though and it really speaks to Jackson's talent. I was on the edge the entire time I was reading the book, waiting to see how it would played out. 
 So would I recommend the book? I'll say the same thing I said to a friend who asked. If you enjoy books that fuck with your brain, this is it. If you like complex books that push you to think deeper about the values you hold, about whats right and wrong, this is it. So basically, read the flippin book and then HMU because I still have a lot of feels that I NEED TO TALK ABOUT. 
 Note that I received an advanced copy of this book for review."
4,"The First half of this entry to the Honor series was pretty slow - many pages of blocks of text that I found myself skimming. The second half really started picking things up, and the action took off. If it wasn't for all of the 'inner monologue' of Honor and Whitehaven in the first part, it would have been a five star book."
4,"if you're looking for a badass story between good and evil, you've picked the right book. if you're sick with a cold or the flu, you should probably try a different one. i was starting to get sick when i first picked up the book- it was so fun to read about how civilization could die and how i could die and how our society could die, etc. etc. hahhaha- just kidding, it really freaked me out. 
 i absolutely loved the beginning of this book. i was hooked right from the start and only found myself wavering during some of frannie's dialogue. if i can stay hooked for 1300 pages, it's a keeper. 
 i'm used to end of the world stories now, so what made this so great was randall flagg and the supernatural elements he brought to the story. i loved and believed all of the characters, even the evil ones. i'll reread this one again and again, i'm sure."
3,"Well-written, beautifully illustrated, and it kept me guessing. A nice collaboration altogether."
3,"** spoiler alert ** 
 It was thoroughly strange. It was mostly interesting with a few parts dragging. I think what was interesting and kept me reading was so I could find a point to where the whole story was going. I never really found the point. I think I understand what the author was getting at in the last few pages, but a lot of weird stuff to get there.(view spoiler)[I don't consider this a spoiler but what I gathered is that the character lived a lie. This in-turn left them without an identity to speak of. (hide spoiler)]"
4,"Borderline ashamed I went this long without reading this, but I'm glad I finally did. Probably the best dystopian book I've read in a long while; it made me want to read more Margaret Atwood as well."
5,"Neanderthal Seeks Human by Penny Reid is the first book in her Knitting in the City series. This book truly is a smart romance. I had to break out the dictionary feature on my kindle a few times. I absolutely loved the writing style and humor. It was phenomenal. The story of Janie and Quinn is a wonderful one and the knitting group is the bomb. 
 Every detail is so-well thought out and arranged, the trivia is unique and quirky and this was an absolute pleasure to read. The love scenes are intense in a fade-to-black way and the level of ""feels"" you'll have throughout the telling of Janie and Quinn's story is off-the-charts. 
 First read July 3-5, 2014"
4,"I'm hovering between 3 and 4 stars for this book, not because it wasn't good, because it totally was, but because I'm a little iffy in the E.T. category. But I did like the presentation of a kind-of-bisexual female character, who really shunned the labeling, and didn't really even consider her own sexuality until she was faced with it, that seems a lot more real to me than a lot of other stories out there. But otherwise, compelling, gripping story, and I still want to read the sequel, E.T. or not!"
4,"Holy crap. This book! 
 THIS BOOK WAS AWESOME! 
 And I will write a review tomorrow when it is not 1.30 in the morning and I stayed up late to finish THIS BOOK. Because I mentioned it's awesome, right? 
 *** 
 Okay, so I've had a day to regroup and reevaluate a bit. I still love this book but I'm dropping down a star because I didn't really feel the ending. Anderson's breakdown and recovery felt kind of rote. It's probably an awful thing to say but I really would have liked a more violent reaction from Anderson. We kept getting told that Alpha was a part of him, but Anderson never felt that Alpha-ish. 
 Speaking of Alpha, I would have also loved to see more of him, not in flashback or on film but interacting with ""real"" people at the station. 
 The best thing about this book were the holograms. Absolutely fascinating! I was more upset about their deaths than Anderson's family. 
 Anderson was a great character, as were his holograms. I wasn't as invested in CJ, but I liked that he was by no means a perfect hero. 
 I wasn't too fond of the amount of crying CJ and Cassie did. Hey, I can cry because I'm the reader, but you guys are supposed to be mental health professionals. You see fucked up shit everyday. Maybe not as totally fucked up as Anderson, but you've got to have some sort of armour on. 
 These are all nitpicking details. Frankly I'm judging this book to a higher standard because it is a really great book. The premise is fantastic and the world building is phenomenal. 
 Read this book!"
4,This book needs a cover remodel. It looks like animation straight out of Jimmy Neutron! It totally disguises the amazingness of itself!
5,"An exquisite, magical story with careful detail given to the historical setting of the Turkish court and the local surroundings. The ambitious, bright girl can be sympathized with as she weaves her way through an imperial culture that is as foreign to her as to the modern reader. The scene where she is in the hold of the ship impresses itself upon the memory."
3,"I was disappointed in this book in so many ways. First, the good, or not so bad stuff: It was easy to read and had a few funny parts. Characters were interesting. Now the bad... 
 (view spoiler)[ 
 First of all, the Miss Spence was mysterious and I felt for sure would have somehow played in the plot resolution. 
 I also thought that for sure David Zinc was going to eventually win the main Krayoxx case, perhaps by introducing the fact that Varrick had paid a settlement to the estate of the politician. That didn't even come up in court. Perhaps that was another way of emphasizing the ineptitude of the three stooges, but then again, perhaps the omission was due to the poor showing of this author, who ever it was. 
 When David inexplicably got smart and suddenly started brilliantly cross-examining the last witness, I thought maybe some pages were omitted from my book. How did David come to have all that research about Varrick's past? Why no mention of it before? Other than being mad about what the Hung Juror wrote, what prompted David to finally come to life - without any warning to the reader? There was no ""a-ha"" moment that precipitated David's moment of glory, so the moment of glory made no sense and served no purpose, especially since it didn't lead to a positive conclusion for the core case that was the subject of 80% of the book. It was like ""This is a slow train wreck for 250 pages... Then a HUGE turnaround for 10 pages, giving me hope... Then back to the finish of the train wreck."" 
 Also, what was the necessity of the Hung Juror character? Was it just a way to give another perspective on the ridiculous trial? Or a way to get this work of art over 350 pages? 
 It was good that David had a win in the ""Nasty Teeth"" case, and seemed plausible and logical that he would make the ""partnership"" deal with F&F. But then, the partnership dissolves within a year when Oscar and Wally walk away? What kind of epilogue is that? 
 And seriously, who gives a secretary - no matter how lovable - a $100k bonus when at last there is some revenue? 
 In general, there was no element of mystery that ever came to light that gave the protagonist (either of them) something they needed, so they could win their case. Are we really supposed to believe that after all the bad stuff Varrick has done in the past, that they are truly innocent with Krayoxx?

5,"An ARC of this title was provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review. My thoughts are my own. 
 This review (and a giveaway thru 5/3!) can also be found at The Starry-Eyed Revue. 
 With every retelling of The Scarlet Pimpernel I read, I'm more and more convinced that I absolutely must read the original classic. And while it's true that this is technically only the second retelling I've read, it is by far my favorite. I would give this book all the stars. Neverending, infinity stars. 
 But this book is not strictly a retelling; it is more of a tribute to the original story and very well done at that. I guess you could call this book post-apocalyptic in nature because of it's focus on France after the shifting of the poles, subsequent holes in the ozone and the resulting fall of technology. But it doesn't feel like your typical post-apocalyptic fare. This story is just so much goodness wrapped into one pretty package, and it's focus was more reliant on the fact that history is doomed to repeat itself and the revolution that fact seems to spark in people. 
 Sophia Bellamy is my favorite kind of heroine: skilled but not infallible, charming but not easily trusting, and completely and totally underestimated. Rene Hasard is also my favorite kind of love interest. The one who worms his way into the heroine's heart -- but not easily -- and provides me with delicious banter. Which is also why this is one of my favorite kinds of romances...I just adore the passion of a good hate-to-love romance. 
 The entire cast of characters endeared themselves to me practically from the beginning, though. Hasard's family charmed the pants off me, and Sophia's cohorts were no less enchanting. And the vile LeBlanc and Allemande were sufficiently evil. I've said it before, but I don't usually enjoy novels with so many third person perspectives. Though I think I may be retracting that statement in the near future with as many novels as I've enjoyed recently written in just that style. I was so engrossed in this novel that I just stopped expecting characters to act a certain way or for things to happen and simply allowed myself to enjoy the story. 
 It wasn't hard to do. This book just does not quit. Fast-paced from the moment I cracked the spine and it only picked up speed as I continued to read. It was intense and I was fraught with nerves the entire time, especially as one character's perspective would leave off on one train of thought, only to have another character pick up that same train of thought. It rent the novel with a sense of urgency that had me flipping pages well past my usual bedtime. I haven't found the energy to stay up into the night just to finish a novel in ages, but that's exactly what I did with Rook. 
 This homage to The Scarlet Pimpernel is definitely going to make it onto my list of favorites this year. It's just such a ME book and it's definitely left me curious about the author's other works. And I am just so happy to have read such an amazing fantasy novel that isn't the beginning of another trilogy. :) 
 GIF it to me straight:"
4,"Ouch. That hurt. In a very weird, good, haunting way. 
 I'm a big Siobhan Dowd fan, so - although I don't really know anything Patrick Ness - this was a must-read for me, and I'm so glad I picked it up. It was gorgeously written, and Conor was a perfectly constructed character. 
 If you're into emotional reads, I really, really recommend this. Hell, if you're into reading I recommend this."
3,"I admit, I was anticipating some ""relentless"" puns as part of this review but over the course of Valiant and Relentless the story has taken a dramatic turn for the better. I still have my quibbles but at least we're not recycling the same story over and over again like the first three books. 
 I'm still feeling that this series would have been a lot better off as maybe a duology/trilogy because a lot of time and effort goes into recaps and a lot of scenes feel forced as explanations are replayed for the umpteenth time (when chapter two kicked off yet another marveling rendition of the conference room technology I think I may have audibly sighed). Same deal with things that should just be extra descriptive detail on the characters, in chapter four there's a scene where ""Geary never expected to be able to joke about his past being so long ago"" which is fine, except he also felt that late in book four too. 
 I'm still not thrilled about the technology and effort that's gone into explaining it, the path toward technobabble that was tentatively blazed by Valiant's ""self-sustaining probability modulation on a quantum scale"" has not been followed thankfully but I'd still like to know more about the shielding and inertial dampening, the Hypernet gates too actually although that's obviously less likely to be possible! 
 I don't think a lot more is going on with characters here either, right up front in chapter one there's an abruptly personal argument between Geary and Desjani that I guess was borne of events from Valiant...somehow, it really didn't gel with the closing chapters of Valiant and the conclusions that those two came to. Rione and Desjani are still refusing to talk to each other, which really is quite annoying. 
 All in all, it's a story with a set of familiar characters that (perhaps a little too neatly) ties up all the previous sub-plots bar one, which I assume will be the focus of Victorious. I'm looking forward to finishing that book, at which point I'm going to declare myself done - regardless of how it ends. If you enjoyed all the previous books, you'll definitely enjoy this one, and the inverse also applies."
5,"5th out of the 10 short stories that Cassandra Clare released about the Shadowhunter Academy after the war. 
 Robert Lightwood tells his story about the time when they are still in the Academy with Valentine. Isabelle is with her so you can expect a lot of Sizzy moments here :D 
 5/5 for Simon and Isabelle :D"
4,"I received an Advanced Reader's Copy of this book from Young to Publishing Group (YPG) ""Word of Mouth"" program, so thanks to YPG! I think the hype for this is well deserved--Warner Brothers already has the film rights, starring Emma Watson (not the best choice). There's a lot of missing information about ""The Crossing,"" the utopian dream of a man named William Tear, which would have been useful in the first book, but I hope to understand more of in the rest of the series. Overall, I enjoyed this story, Kelsea is a great character. I am glad the author doesn't rely on stupid tropes, like a love triangle or having Kelsea be secretly beautiful if she gets a makeover. She's more complex than that and I could relate more to her decisions more as the queen. I am jealous that she knew what to say any time she made an address or gave an order; being a queen comes naturally. This book has a lot of great potential. Also, I did enjoy the more gritty parts of the story, bodies burning, heads on pikes, drug use, which is why it often is compared to Game of Thrones. It makes sense, but it's not quite at that level (not nearly as complex character/ plot structure). Another point I will be looking for in the next book: what will happen to The Mace?"
5,"This was the best Princess book yet. This series is seriously underrated. 
 All the fairy tale hype in the last years and no one talks about Hines. 
 He's a male author but writes great female characters and he has a lot of them. Warriors with fierce hearts but personal codes of honor, leaders who raised from rags to riches but stayed kind, sorcerers, queens, treacherous fearies, bloodthirsty assassins. 
 I'm so so sorry that only the first installment got translated to Czech because the people around the world deserve to have access to Princesses."
5,"This was fantastic. I loved this book. It had enough fun in it to make it a great read. The story revolves around a series of deaths during the summer in a small Minnesota town. The ""coming of age"" elements are great; the interaction with parents, the tension between being a kid and growing sexuality, wrestling with big questions about God but still innocent enough to just have fun. 
 The tension and reality of the marriage of the parents is awesome. The friendship built from the war that the dad and Gus have is moving especially when the dad finds himself weeping in his church. The fine details about Minnesota life and descriptions of the town and social distinctions/racism is well written. 
 I loved this whole book. Coming of age stories could all be like this, with the backdrop of massive amounts of tension from dramatic stories or death and resolution."

 Synopsis: Pay close attention and you might solve this. 
 On Monday afternoon, five students at Bayview High walk into detention. 
 Bronwyn, the brain, is Yale-bound and never breaks a rule. 
 Addy, the beauty, is the picture-perfect homecoming princess. 
 Nate, the criminal, is already on probation for dealing. 
 Cooper, the athlete, is the all-star baseball pitcher. 
 And Simon, the outcast, is the creator of Bayview High's notorious gossip app. 
 Only, Simon never makes it out of that classroom. Before the end of detention Simon's dead. And according to investigators, his death wasn't an accident. On Monday, he died. But on Tuesday, he'd planned to post juicy reveals about all four of his high-profile classmates, which makes all four of them suspects in his murder. Or are they the perfect patsies for a killer who's still on the loose? 
 Everyone has secrets, right? What really matters is how far you would go to protect them. 
 - - - 
 This is the story of what happens when five strangers walk into detention and only four walk out alive. Everyone is a suspect, and everyone has something to hide. 
 The blurb for this book is definitely not wrong! One of Us Is Lying is a clusterf*ck of mystery--and I mean this in the best way possible. Everyone in this book indeed carries a secret! 
 Likes: 
 * First of all, I LOVE the premise and I love that the author actually delivered us a great mystery. You know the mystery is a good one when you literally cannot stop guessing. At at least three points in the book I thought I knew who the killer was, but then some clue threw me off. I jumped to someone else, then... again. Same thing. I was on my toes until the very end, and that's what I want in a mystery. 
 * Diversity. There is a gay character in the book, and this I appreciate. I think he was written very well and his being in the closet added a nice suspenseful touch to the book. I can't imagine going through what he did and still coming out on top. 
 * The characters. Keep in mind, this book is from the POV of four different people. It would be easy to get them mixed up if the author didn't do a phenomenal job of distinguishing them from one another with very specific and well-written personalities. Which, of course, she did. Very very well done! They were also quite relatable and lovable. It was easy to like each of them and want them to get through the situation at hand. 
 * Romance. Yes, there is a romance in this book. Now, it is subtle, but nicely done. Two of the suspects become very close and we get a hint of blooming feelings and stolen kisses, but it doesn't take over the story in the least. This book, at it's core, is a mystery--the romantic aspect doesn't change that. In fact, I think it enhanced it because... the two teens getting into a relationship during the investigation leaves a lot of room for distrust and questionable movies, etc. 
 * The ending. I had a love/hate thing going with the ending. I feel that the end of a book is, arguably, the most important part of the book. I always seem to criticize the end more than anything else. This is the case here as well. The part I enjoyed was the end/answer to the mystery portion. The big reveal of who the murderer was intrigued me! I'd definitely guessed who did it at that point, but there were pieces that didn't make sense until the actual reveal. Once that happened, it all came together perfectly. I think it was extremely well done and I am greatly impressed. 
 Now, my one and only dislike: (This will be spoilery!!!) 
 The other part of the ending... the part that had nothing to do with the actual mystery storyline. It was the romance. Oh boy! Now, the two teens who had a romance going... they sort of ""broke up"" after the killer was outed. The guy felt useless and like he wasn't good enough for the oh-so-smart girl. So, he ignores her and she starts to move on, yeah? Well, some months later, she is going about her life and he decides to make some grand gesture to get her back. It was cute, but so incredibly cliche! lol A bit eyeroll worthy, but again, still cutesy. I can't hate on it too hard. 
 So, overall, this book was a winner for me. I loved almost every single thing about it from the character development, to the romance, to the mystery. Aside from the tiny pet peeve about the ending, this book goes onto my favorites list. I definitely recommend it if you enjoy a good high school drama/mystery. Extremely well done!

5,"I really don't know how Kristan Higgin's does it: I keep loving her characters so much. 
 Honestely, Faith and Levi are always probably going to be my all time favs. But, Connor and Jess are kind of great as well! 
 I've now read all the Blue Heron Series, I read these sequentially and I swear to the Book Gods that they got better every single time. 
 The writing style was flawless. It moves fluid from one perspective to another and can I just say that Higgins really knows how to describe Manningsport, NY. It sounds beautiful and I want to move there as soon as possible. 
 Now, onto the plot, don't get me wrong - it is the same as the other four books in the series: there are two people, they fall in love, something goes wrong, they overcome that and all end happily ever after. BUT, all the books have their own little spin or circumstances. In Anything for You, Connor and Jess have their own issues (Connor is a grump and Jess used to be a slut who has a disabled brother and is way too independent for her own good); but they have so much depth that I absolutely loved this. 
 The characters of Blue Heron Series are amazing. I absolutely love them, and Connor and Jess are fantastic. I love that we get to see all the old couples as well, and get an update on their lives as well. I would have like a bit more of Jack and Emmaline - but I don't mind. I also really enjoyed that we got a bit more of Pru as a friend, rather than an older sister. 
 So, lastly the feels. Of course Anything for You pulls at the heartstrings, how could Higgins not? But it was more than that, this wasn't just a romance - it was about personal growth, about love and development, about letting go and holding on. It was fantastic. 
 Anything for You was amazing; an easy and perfect read for fans of the Blue Heron Series; my only hope is that it isn't the last."
4,"Finally, the character I've been waiting so long to read about! Prince Honorous Jorg Ancrath is truly a twisted and tortured soul, with absolutely no recognizable moral values. He kills on a whim, inflicts violence without reproach, and is unyieldingly self-centered. 
 So why do we love reading about him? Part of it is the same reason that Glotka is so popular from Joe Abercrombie's First Law trilogy: a morbid fascination with violence and an insight into the thought process of these seemingly brutal men. 
 But the difference is that Jorg seems to enjoy his violence. And not from an evil villain point of view either. It seems to be succumbing to his primal human nature. He has no hesitation when it comes to questionable actions. Don't like what someone just said about you? Stick a sword through his throat. Someone challenged you to a duel? Fight dirty and shoot him with a crossbow instead. 
 There are those little moments in life when our brains come up with wild fantasies, that of course we would never dream of carrying out. Things like smashing your car into the guy who just cut you off, or punching the grocery clerk who is taking too damn long to process your order, or throwing your computer out the window when it crashes. You can keep going, and I hope you know what I mean, but like I said, they are fantasies for most of us, and reality for Jorg. 
 If you're not squeamish about violence and situations where your jaw will actually drop (""he did what?!?!"" or ""what the &$%# did I just read?""), check out this taunting tale with a delicate touch of horror that reads like poetry. 
 The one small drawback for me was the lack of a secondary world. The setting seems to be largely inspired by Europe, and there are a lot of real concepts thrown in there, like the Pope, Aristotle, and Sun Tzu. It's just a weird proportion of what is invented and what is carried over. The nuclear bombs and computer programs did it for me. I'm sure there's a mystery in there, as I'm starting to see hints of a post-apocalyptic world, but I don't think it adds anything to the story."
5,"Oh my gosh, this book was PURE PERFECTION! Cassandra Clare has long since earned her place as one of my favourite authors ever (with The Mortal Instruments series and the first book for this steampunk prequel series, Clockwork Angel), but she's outdone herself with this one! 
 I didn't think it was possible to love Tessa even more in Clockwork Prince, but I did! She was just so strong, and intelligent, and determined, and not once did my heart differ from hers -- we connected like that. Like always, Clare managed to create a cast that amazed me with their intricacy. 
 And Tessa, Will (who I now love even more than Jace!! ), and Jem (who has his own chance to shine in this book!) make up the epitome of a perfect love triangle -- one where you're honestly so torn that it splits your heart in two. I wanted to cry several times! 
 Don't get me started on the storyline. It was complex and risky and heartbreaking and breathtaking, and it didn't resemble the middle-book-filler pattern AT ALL. It actually had a plot with so many twists and turns that it could snap a neck, and it captivated me for all near-500 pages. 
 Words will not do this book justice. They can't describe how beautifully vivid Clare writes, how amazing she is at world-building, and how I could want to laugh and cry so much for one book. So I'll just have to say that if you haven't picked up a Clare book yet, then you are totally missing out! 
 And if you have, then know that Clockwork Prince is even more amazing than everyone's high expectations. And it's even better than the first book, too! I've never read a series that makes the characters and world feel as real as Clare makes hers! :) 
 BUY or BORROW?: I am sending you subliminal messages right now to BUY THIS BOOK when it comes out! It's AMAZING to say the least!!! Definitely one of my favourites! 
 (Original review at Mimi Valentine's YA Review Blog)"
5,"Amazing, wonderful and so sweet. 
 We start with Zev at age 30 trying to convince his parents that he wants to wait for his true-mate. As a powerful Alpha of a large wolf pack, Zev has lots of responsibilities but Jonah is not something he's willing to lose. 
 I love how we then go back to the beginning and get the full story of how Zev (in his wolf form) met Jonah as a baby...and the connection was already there. We get to see first friendship, then love bloom between these two. 
 Lots of chemistry...super hot."
3,"After reading The Nature of Jade and seeing the tags ""Romance"" and ""Chick Lit"" on Goodreads, I guess I was expecting more of a romance-y read. Of course, I was wrong. 
 On one hand, The Story of Us was excellently written - I felt I could relate to certain parts of the book. For example, I felt like I could relate to the whole point of the plot - Cricket and Ben's mother getting married. I knew what it felt like to meet a bunch of in-laws right before that hectic wedding, and trying to fit in. Also, Cricket's relationship with her parents and grandparents reflected my feelings - ""The Grandparent Moment"", miscommunications, balancing between parents, etc. And finally, I felt Caletti's message at the end - that ""love always finds a way home"" - felt so dear to me (I don't know exactly why). But the point is, there are a handful of endearing parts in this book that I loved, making me like this book. 
 On the other hand, sometimes I struggled with finishing the book - maybe it was because I was reading at 1:00 in the morning, half watching Criminal Minds, and half sleeping. However, especially in the beginning of the book, in Cricket's letters to Janssen, I felt the plot was very slow moving and a bit confusing at times. 
 On a side note, one part that I enjoyed about The Story of Us is seeing Jupiter's relationship with Ben, Cricket, and their mother. Their bond with Jupiter is touching, and it makes me want to have a dog too ;____; In addition, the portrayal of the family's feelings when (view spoiler)[Jupiter dies (hide spoiler)] seemed realistic and a little depressing to me. 
 Overall, this book is an okay read for the average female teenager. I recommend this book if you're a dog lover or have had divorced parents or family issues (you can really relate!). However, if you're looking for a romance-y chick-lit piece, this book is not the one."
4,This was fantastic. Bleak & unapologetic.
5,"It took me a while to get into Deathless because it is so confusing at first. But as soon as I got into it, I was gone. It's beautifully written and the story is so compelling and I can't wait to reread it at some point."
5,"*I received a free ARC of Hanover House from Brenda Novak via Netgalley in exchange of an honest and unbiased review* 
 Hanover House is really, really creepy! And well written with an amazing main character who has been through hell, and now wants to help figure out what it is that makes a psychopath. Filled with suspense and a little romance, this prequel definitely made me want more!

 (un)Conventional Bookviews"
5,"1st time around *5 stars* 
 2nd time around **4.5 stars** 
 in conclusion, yes this book is special. I will never forget it and the characters themselves are unforgettable. I cried and laughed and also thought a lot.... about constellations and the stars and the universe and this planet and friendships and true love and and sickness and oblivion and what we leave behind when we're nothing but dust and cancer! Even though they say this book is not about cancer, isn't it though? it is what it is. 
 The only flaw I saw was in Hazels character... I don't mind her cancer or physical appearance or wits or behavior. I like her. but I did mind when she thought Augustus was cleared becuz he had a 80 % chance of survival... she even resented him at one point for taking a long breath as if he was boasting he had good lungs (so not true. & I do realize that Green wanted Hazel with flaws but still. ) 
 and van houton guy irritated me...didn't understand half the things he rambled about in Amsterdam. 
 that is all."
4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 Jerricho Barrons has ruined me for all men - real and fantasy. *le sigh I don't know what it is about him but he just gets under my skin - I love him!!! 
 It's been awhile since I've read anything close to a romance - be it in the form of urban fantasy or my standard historical - but I decided to give horror a break and dive back into my urban fantasy/paranormal romance novels with ""Lothaire"" by Kresley Cole. After that I decided to catch up on the ""Lords"" series since Paris' book in due out next. For some reason, I decided to go back to the 4th book in the Fever series and skim the pages that mentioned Barrons and then I just HAD to finish Shadowfever. See, I'm a bit spoiled when it comes to certain aspects of story-telling and when you kill off my heartthrob - that's a big no no. So when I had started reading ShadowFever last year and it was revealed that the beast was Barrons...I was sick. I did not want to continue reading. Silly me. 
 The final installment was decent. Every page that contained Barrons was 5-star worthy and I skimmed most of the pages that contained Dani...she just annoys me. Although I liked some of the twists that occurred, I was disappointed to discover that V'Lane was Cruce. The death-by-sex fae had grown on me since book #1 and although I wouldn't have chosen him over Barrons, he was a close second. Okay, not that close but second nonetheless. 
 To be honest it was just a lot going on in this final book - ALOT - and was just about as confusing as this review. I still don't know who did what and why or huh but Barrons is my ultimate dream man and so this book deserves nothing less than a 4-star rating."
3,"RTC. I'm not really sure what to say. I feel like a lot of my reviews on mystery/thrillers have been very similar lately. Although, I do think this is an instance where it would've made a better movie than it did a book."
4,"Kinda hated this at the beginning (Sieh is an amusing secondary character but not a sympathetic protagonist) but as the plot developed and it became clear that it wasn't going to be about him moping over some silly girl, I got more into it. Did not love the ending necessarily but it was a solid ending. Did love En (lil cutie, ootchee kootchee coo!). 
 Altogether, I've enjoyed this series. Some solid world building, interesting writing devices, and I appreciated the less heteronormative, less White Imperialism elements of it."
3,"This was boring. I could say that the last few chapters made up for it but still... 
 The problem is that I wanted to know what was happening to some of my fav characters and instead I met new ones I honestly couldn't care less about. 
 Now about Cersei. I really liked her in the previous books but here I just couldn't help myself but hate her because it was so much fun! :D Watching her make error after error and then watching all of those catch up with her... Oh, joy! 
 I sometimes think that Martine changes the story so much to avoid confirming theories that fans have proposed. Anyways, I look forward to reading A Dance With Dragons and hope that it's going to grab me more than this one did :)"
2,"I'm so conflicted, because it was really good, but it also sucked. The entire book it feels like the protagonist is setting up for something huge to happen, but nothing ever does. Literally nothing. I kept picking it up because I thought, ""well maybe it'll happen soon."" But no, it didn't. It was a fascinating and had a lot of potential, but at the end all I feel is disappointed."
4,"This book was a delightful surprise. I picked it up for $2 on a Kindle deal out of curiosity, and wound up reading the entire book in about three days. The narrator has a very engaging voice. He takes the reader with him through how he came to the idea of getting dogs to voluntarily participate in MRIs. We follow along as he goes through the many practical hurdles involved, starting with training the dogs to go into an MRI tube and put their heads in the ""coil"" and hold still, while wearing ear muffs to protect their hearing. There are some wonderful pictures of the dogs in action. The author provides interesting information about how MRIs work, and how he designed his experiment and got the necessary bureaucratic approvals. We follow step by step through the process, what problems arose, and how the scientists and dog owners overcame them. We share in the results. The book includes images of dog and human MRIs, and the author's interpretation of what the results mean."

 Sometimes I need a push to read a book. Whether it's because I've had an iffy experience with the author/similar novels in the past or I simply have too much on my plate already, there have been numerous books widely loved that I just haven't managed to get to yet. Shadow and Bone is one of those novels. For over a year I've been hearing absolutely GLOWING reviews and the current buzz over the third (and final?! I HOPE NOT!) installment coming in the spring has brought this series to my attention once again. 
 Earlier in December, I posted about Epic Recs, a book club of sorts founded by Judith and Amber. What makes this book club different is that you have a partner and you recommend books to each other. You can read more about it in my post - including what book I recommended to Lillian! As for Lillian, she wasted no time in recommending Shadow and Bone and I immediately grabbed a copy from my library. Russia (or, in this case, Russia-inspired), high fantasy, mythology - these are things that IMMEDIATELY appeal to me. I dove right in and, much to my delight, was not disappointed one bit! 
 Shadow and Bone tells the story of Alina and Mal, two orphans who were taken in by a Duke and raised together. When they were children they were visited by Grisha, people who possess magical abilities. Every child in Ravka undergoes testing to determine Grisha talents, but neither Alina nor Mal presented abilities and that was it. Ten years later, however, things have changed. Mal is a tracker in the First Army and Alina is a passable mapmaker. On an expedition to the Shadow Fold, a darkness home to creatures seemingly plucked from nightmares, Alina risks her life to save Mal's and soon the entire kingdom hails the coming of their Sun Summoner. 
 Suddenly Alina is thrown into the world of the Grisha, a world with magic, fine clothes, and people so utterly breathtaking they can't possibly be real (and I won't say anything further on that!). As a Sun Summoner Alina ranks among the most powerful Grisha - comparable to the Darkling, a man who has taken quite an interest in this once-ordinary girl. 
 Alina's put to the test - physically, mentally, and emotionally. She's desperate for a friendly face, she misses the bond she shared with Mal, and struggles to perform her magic. The pressure of being Ravka's savior weighs heavy on her shoulders and the complete lack of word from Mal cuts deep. Could this pale, scrawny, lonely orphan really be the answer to Ravka's prayers? Could Alina truly be the person to banish the Fold? 
 Just like with The Raven Boys, I dreaded the thought of writing a review for Shadow and Bone. I loved this book, absolutely ADORED it, and nothing I could possibly type could ever do it justice. Leigh Bardugo thoroughly won me over, not just with the Russian-esque setting, but with her gorgeous writing, fantastic characters, and beautiful story. I was completely enchanted and had to make the hard decision of reading the entire book in one go (I definitely didn't want to stop!) or take my time to live and breathe this world. Ultimately the latter choice won - though it was certainly a hard decision to make! - and I spent four glorious days immersed in the world of Grisha. 
 It's extremely rare for me to jump right into the next book in a series, but my library currently has a copy of Siege and Storm and, well, I've never been very good at controlling temptation.."
3,Lady Julia and her half-gypsy successful-in-trade fellow Nicholas Brisbane have married and are finishing up their honeymoon in Europe when Julia's sister Portia and brother Plum arrive begging them to help figure out what happened to Portia's lover Jane's husband Freddie. Say that five times fast. The author has gotten too pretentiously aware of herself in this sequel and Julia is far too whiny about how difficult marriage is...and THEN she becomes all aware of how unequal she is to Brisbane and he becomes all manly and pushy and I become all nauseated. I can feel the influences of good romance novelists sneaking in (Julia Quinn's happy families romances in particular) but there are just too many coincidences and too much of a female character second-guessing herself and others encouraging her to do so for me to stand it. And poor Jane! The last section of the book is just a death-a-minute and some mopey parenthood sappiness. Still worth 3 stars but mostly because of the promise of the very first book in the series.
5,"I cried, I laughed and I was angry while reading this third part of the book. For me this is a sign that the book is really good, because it makes me care for the characters. It makes me a part of their story, I'm the quiet observer that is raging internally. I loved this book. From the scary as fuck moment in the beginning, to the very end ... it took me 6 hours to read it. I sat in my room, loaded my bed with snacks and drinks and when I started reading it ... i just coldn't stop. I recommend the whole trilogy to everyone that loves romance, erotica and drama stories. It's... I'm simply speechless! I love this book!"
3,"So. Dang. Slow. Until the end 
 Not my fave in the series."
4,"#2 Stephanie Plum comic mystery series 
 Read pre-G/R"
4,"Alec of Kerry is a teenage orphan stuck in a dungeon on trumped up charges of spying. He's worried that he's going to be killed when a mysterious stranger is thrown into the dungeon with him, and proceeds to not only free himself from the shackles, but takes Alec along as well. Some horse thievery, swift thinking and a fair bit of hiding, and the two have escaped their pursuers. 
 Over the course of the next few days, Alec discovers that the stranger is able to assume a number of personas and identities without any trouble, and is actually a spy of sorts. His true name is Seregil, and after noticing how quickly Alec picks up new skills, he impulsively offers to take the young man on as an apprentice. Alec has never really known any other life than that of a trapper and hunter in the provincial north, so Seregil's tales of adventure, excitement, travel and exotic locations sounds mighty tempting indeed. 
 Of course, the covert life of espionage is a bit more dangerous than being a country hunter, and some of the people Seregil's in the area finding information about are entirely ruthless. When Seregil falls seriously ill while they're on the run, Alec gets the chance to save Seregil's life, using what he's learned and his quick mind to get them safely to the capital and Seregil's wizard friend. 
 They discover that there is a plot against the crown, and someone is trying to implicate Seregil with very clever forgeries. Alec needs to help his new friends figure out who is behind it, before it's too late. 
 I had not realised that this is basically only the first half of the story. It ends after the first part of the story is concluded, but on a fairly abrupt cliffhanger, there's even a to be continued. So for anyone who hasn't read the book already, there is a second part, Stalking Darkness, that finishes the story of Alec and Seregil and their main adventure. 
 The book took me longer to read than I'm used to, both because I've been busy with course work and correction in the last weeks, but also because it's fantasy written in a different style than what is mostly common now. The story builds in a much slower way, and while there is plenty of action scenes interspersed with the exposition to keep the reader interested, the exposition is a lot more gradual. It reminded me a bit of playing a computer game, where you start out with an inexperienced, low-level character. First you have to discover your surroundings, get some basic equipment, learn your basic skills, do the basic quests. Following Alec on his adventure with Seregil is reminiscent of that - he gets new stuff, learns new skills, and slowly but surely ""levels up"", getting more experienced and discovering more of the world and more dangerous things keep happening. 
 It's a fun book, and I will absolutely be reading the next book to see how young Alec's adventures proceed."

5,"I cri evritim :''( 
 This shiz is ahmayzinccc 
 A 5 star rating, causeeee I love young adult books and dystopianssss. The plot's unique (maybe :3),but I have to admit that it has a bit of The Hunger Games vibe. I expected the main character to be a Mary Sue, but NOH. Tris has a realistic personality and flaws. I also like the fact that she's not comfortable with guys, lol. And how she makes decisions that makes her look selfish :DDD I'm just sick of characters that are too perfect and too nice. Okay, enough of Tris :] The story is action packed :D Yep that sums up the whole story. One thing that surprises me is that this book is Veronica Roth's debut :O Like dayuum gurrll!!11!! Okay me is going to watch teh movieee"
4,"Amazing book. It would become one of my favorites if not for the ""Paine"" thing, I seriously hate HATE love triangles even if its justified and cleverly put together. But its about all that turns me off. 
 Mmm. Rhia has really grown into her power with blood and sweat and tragedy. The setting, the war, a wide scale of grayness - nothing is just black and white. All the little things and characters, so gooood. 
 Huge thanks to Mrs Jaimie AKA J.A.Saare for so much effort to create a crazy, wonderful book with twist, action, love and hate. 
 God bless You, woman. 
 Off to the next one!"
5,"I have put off writing this review so I could get my thoughts in order. I read the book first before I read any other reviews. I am going to tell you what I thought as well as address some of the negative criticism. Why? Because I can and because my boss is at a meeting off site so I can write this review for as long as I want! 
 Sometimes I forget what a book is about and need to reread it before I read a newly released sequel. The scene of Eva on the floor in front of Gideon's door and him falling to the floor in her arms has been burned into my brains for moths. No rereading was necessary. I can absolutely see that scene in a movie as it was sooooo vivid in my head. 
 Banks delivered in the sex department fo sho. In the last two trilogies I read, it seemed like the sex got boring. It was the same. If you have read any of my other reviews, you know I like 'out of the bedroom' sex. I got this in Entwined. As well, I found the 'modes of transportation' sex concept very comical. 
 Gideon: Again, I just finished a sequel where I loved the hero in book one and was just eh in book two. Gideon retains all of the qualities that make him Gideon. He is always thinking of Eva, even when it doesn't seem like it. He does over the top things for her that most women can only dream of and most men are too dense to think of. Somehow Banks manages to write him in such a way that he is broken yet incredibly strong and masculine at the same time. That is hard to do. The broken ones often lose some of their masculinity at some point in the story. We saw Gideon break down but still put that suit on and be the bad ass billionaire he is. He remains my fav billionaire hero and main attraction in my fantasies. 
 Plot: The fact that they had to hide their love away (that is a Beatles song) was good. It was compelling and something that I, as the reader, could latch on to. I felt like they went into the public eye too quickly and this theme could have been elaborated on. Nevertheless, it was compelling. 
 The criticism: Lots of reviews complained about Megumi and why Banks was going to drag the series out for her story. At this point, do I care about Megumi? No. Do I care about Mark's wedding? No. I am not going to criticize a book tho because of things that MAY happen. This book was good. I am judging it based on itself and not future books. 
 My criticism: Cary. I missed him. He wasn't around very much in this book. Ole girl getting pregnant was def more interesting to me than Megumi. I grew to love Cary in the first two books. His scenes didn't resonate with me the way they did in the first two books."
5,"First of all, look at the cover. It is perfect (and even better when you hold the real book in your hands). 
 ATTENTION: The following review may contain a tiny amount of spoilers ;) 
 This book is a sort of off-beat mix of a ""Beauty and the Beast"" re-write and loads of Indian (the country India) cultural-specific touches...like gods, goddesses, and stories of legend. Two Indian brothers are cursed and turn into tigers, or they did three hundred some years ago. The only way they can break out of the curse is with the help of an American girl. The cultural differences are obvious and interesting. The dialogue is lively and the plot was pretty riveting. I don't know why but it just seemed to suck me into the world of India, with not only those modern cultural differences but also a feeling of fantasy. 
 I also found it extremely amusing reading about Ren's reactions, when he was in tiger form, to Kelsey as she talks to him. There is a little bit of, I wouldn't say ""love"", but ""like"" triangle between Ren, Kishan, and Kelsey. I would call what is between Ren and Kelsey budding love. Kishan is younger then Ren and is sort of the black sheep compared to Ren, but I think Kishan is a really nice person under his flirty cover. 
 The book had a lot more romance than I anticipated. So while it was about legends and curses, it was also about an insecure teenage girl trying to stop herself from falling in love. And believe me, she tries. All in all, you should read this immediately and see for yourself."
4,"WARNING: This book contains very vivid descriptions of sex. 
 NEGATIVES: 
 1. The ending is really sudden and abrupt. It just shifted a bit too quickly and felt very rushed. One minute the tone was quite happy and then BAM it shifted so unexpectedly. It was a little confusing. 
 2. There are some phrases that are repeatedly used over and over again. An example of this is ""he gasped"" or ""I gasped"". STOP GASPING. It was so annoying. 
 POSITIVES: 
 1. I really liked the love story. The sex scenes didn't take away from the real love underneath. I fell in love with these two characters, the drama was addictively great. 
 2. So Christian may be a crazy psychotic sex freak but there is something about him. I can understand why Anna is just hypnotised by this millionaire. He's just so mysterious and I was dying to learn more about his past! 
 3. Its addictive, and I considered this a good thing. You just have to keep reading to find out what happens next. I thought the pacing was great and I loved it. 
 4. I loved the ending even though it felt rushed. I thought the decision Anna made was the correct one. I liked how it didn't end in a cheesy manner. I know there is more to come in the next books but I thought the way the first book ended was the right way to go."
5,"Riley was awesome, amazing and I didn't think that a relationship between cat and wolf would ever work, but Nalini Singh pulled it off. Riley was one of the fiercest, protective alpha wolves I've ever read, but he knew how far to push Mercy and he understood how important it was for her to not change who she was. It was awesome watching these two dominant changelings realize they could be themselves with each other; that in fact, that was what each loved about the other. For if either changed, there would be no relationship. 
 And the end, when he brought her home? I cried. It was such a sweet, beautiful moment! 
 What I am loving most about this series is not only that each couple is so diverse, has different issues they're dealing with and different backgrounds, but more that the plot surrounding these characters is so interesting. I have never, ever been so anxious and excited at the same time to read the next in the series and to keep going. I want to see how it all works out. I want to know who the Ghost is. I want to know what happens to the NetMind, the DarkMind, and the PsyNet. And I want to know more about the humans and whether they will turn out to be friend or will they turn bad (again). And what is an X-Psy? Is that what Kaleb is? What does that mean? Each installment answers so many questions but then leaves me with so many more!"
3,"I like this book, and the struggle the Main characters had to go though. It was interesting and very sad, but also motivating. The thing about this book that made me not like it as much was the ending. I thought the ending was just weirdly misplaced. Other than that and the repeating of words from Candace it was over all a decent book."
3,"It is hard for me to separate the story from the movie, partly because my book has the movie poster as its cover. I can say that the movie followed the book very closely, and as I revisited these scenes I found myself seeking something more, it could be that this desire stemmed from having seen the movie first. There is a lot of dialogue, and the descriptions of settings and details are focused on orientation of physical space and movement, which left me yearning for more abstraction. When the patients are being interviewed or their actions are being described the tone of creepiness comes through clear, but the presence of the mental institution itself was lacking. I did not get a chance to know the walls of the mental institution (aside from the water, the motif was used expertly), which is of upmost importance in a story that thrives off of isolation, imprisonment, and denial. Were the walls immaculate and nose-stingingly-sanitized or water damaged and dirty? The lack of vivid detail was disappointing, especially so with some of the nightmares. The dreams presented an opportunity to balance out some of the rigid descriptions, they were a creative free pass to anything Dennis Lehane wanted but were not fully realized. The passages are very plot focused, which don't get me wrong- the plot is fantastic, but the book would have been even better with some creative meandering to salt its pages. I get that it's a noir story and thereby somewhat colorless, but shadows and cigarette smoke can still come alive. Maybe it was the five pages of reviews that hyped the story up and raised my expectations, one specifically stating that the story was like ""Stephen King or Edgar Allan Poe coming up with [Shutter Island] if they collaborated after dropping LSD"" sticking out from the rest because it was so far from true. The story is excellent because of the plot and how carefully crafted Teddy's insanity is, but disappointing at the same time because of what it could have been with more vivid detail."
4,"Clever, warm, sweet, but also terrifying, with a subtle current of darkness even under the main 'bad guys' of the story. Like, for example, (view spoiler)[what about that poor girl that was Bunting's imaginary friend? What was her story? (hide spoiler)] 
 I appreciate that one reviewer compared this to Dahl and Gaiman. I'd also add that if you're familiar with Emily Gravett you know why she's the perfect choice as illustrator. And I'm grateful that she did lots of illustrations for it! 
 I will consider more by the author, and of course I will continue to read more by the illustrator."

 Overview: Third Read: 
 IaEUR(tm)m always a little scared to re-read books I love. IaEUR(tm)ve read so much since the last time, IaEUR(tm)ve lived so much, will my perspective be different? When I read it this time, will I notice glaring issues? Not relate to the characters? Fall out of love with it? 
 No. 
 I did notice things others might not enjoy. And I understand I justaEUR| donaEUR(tm)t relate. 
 The writing style is as artistic as the characters and the whole book drips with prose. The metaphors are eccentric, dramatic, and consistent. If you donaEUR(tm)t like the writing style, you wonaEUR(tm)t like the book. 
 And I feel so very, very sorry for you."
5,"OMGGGG SO GOOD!!!!!!! 4.5 stars but rounding up due to awesomeness (the .5 star was lost due to complete romantic befuddlement on my part; yes I'm biased, deal with it!). Also whoever invented the cliffhanger is my personal nemesis. This second installment does not disappoint!! 
 I stand by what I said, that THIS SERIES is the Game of Thrones for the YA crowd (OR, if you're like me, the crowd who can't handle real GoT! haha). Multiple POVs from new, recurring, and secondary characters, characters killed off left and right (have you no mercyyyyy :( ), and devious plots by an evil king. Nothing is what it appears. Something I didn't like so much is that a BUNCH of love triangles were established! I already hate love triangles! So to have a bunch killed me. Still so good! And that ending!! ARGHHHHHH!!! 
 The characters have evolved so much!! Magnus is really coming into himself. Poor Jonas is being run more by emotions than his head. Cleo is still amazing, maintaining strength and integrity throughout. Lucia's growing on me A TAD bit, but now she is a bit bipolar. I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE NEXT INSTALLMENT!!! (view spoiler)[ Based on where we leave off, I really hope we start to see everyone working together for a common goal. If only they could just look past bias and prejudice, they would see that they all want the same things!!! GAHHHH!! (hide spoiler)]"
5,"I've read this delightful book many times in the course of my life. It is always a treat to see the way this spunky young girl, who expects nothing from life and yet always dreams of a romantic future, changes from the unloved orphan to a joy to Matthew and Marila Cuthbert. What makes Anne so easy to identify with? She is far from perfect, in fact, she goes from one disaster to another, and yet, she is truly repentant and determined to do better. I think it is because she is so open and honest. She faces up to her faults and I think that makes us love her. We understand the impulses that make her fly off the handle and then abjectly repent. We laugh when she confesses a theft of Marilla's pin in a scene that could come from the ""Perils of Pauline,"" and then laugh harder when we find that the confession was made up. 
 L. M. Montgomery has created a child for the ages as well as contributing to our creative vocabulary with phrases like, ""scope for the imagination,"" ""kindred spirit"" and ""bosom companion. We all know what it is like to yearn for a better world with the things that really matter and love having them happen to Anne, who takes us along for the journey."
3,"Action packed, it was entertaining."
4,I feel in love with this book...well it is a Nicholas Sparks book :) i really like the plot of the story and the characters as well. the ending was really good i like it :)
4,"i cant decide if i loved this more than the previous book, but i'm in love with tucker and elliot and i need more of them. josh pls write more books with them"
2,"Two and a half stars, maybe pushing three. The story was mildly entertaining. I only wished the characters had more depth to them. The story oscillated a great deal between parts i could get into and identify with and utter blandness with a heavy dash of rushing through the story."
5,"I'd watch these characters sit for a whole novel and discuss paint drying. That's how freaking much I love them and everything they do and say and are to each other. 
 Luckily, this story contains an actual plot, so all the above is unnecessary. I just wanted you to realize that I'm not the best equipped to discuss the story line (nor will I), because when you're in love with all the Raven Boys and desperate to spend just a bit more time in their world, it's very hard to take off the blinders and worry about something as seemingly insignificant as story structure. ;)"
5,"Source: I received a free digital copy of this book from the publisher, Macmillan, via Netgalley in exchange for a honest review. 
 Cost: Free 
 Title: Beautiful Broken Things 
 Author: Sara Barnard 
 Genre: YA, contemporary 
 Overall Rating: 4.5 stars 
 This book is a stunning debut that has you hooked from the start and you're so in love with the characters that it's kind of okay that there's a big build up. It's okay that Suzanne is so elusive for a while and it's okay that it doesn't have the mystery of an E Lockhart book or the lyrical writing of a Jandy Nelson book. But I'd still pair it in the same category as those types of books. 
 This book shows suicide from the views of those around you, it shows how sometimes people don't know and it shows that sometimes people are judgemental, but overall it shows the struggle in a really solid way and it shows the signs that you should look out for. 
 This is one of those YA books that tackles a difficult topic in a not so difficult way and I think younger readers need books like this. 
 Plus the cover is gorgeous."
3,"I FINALLY finished this book. 
 (Don't pick on me, it's my ""work"" book). 
 I don't have too much to say on this book, but I will say it was a good read. There were suspenseful parts, there were parts that seemed to drag a bit, there were great parts, and parts that were not so great. 
 All in all, I'm definitely going to continue with the series. I've heard good things, and I hope my expectations are surpassed."
3,"The Taker is a fantasy, to be sure, but the core of the story is love. Not teenage love, or first love, but encompassing, do-anything-for-the-other love. 
 (view spoiler)[ 
 Lanny and Jonathan have a rare love, a love born of friendship, and through the intervention of fantastical means, a love that could, in fact, last forever. Through a chance meeting with a club of what can only be called immortals, Lanny becomes one herself. Then, when she returns to her hometown to procure Jonathan for her new leader, she witnesses his murder, and turns him immortal as well. This could be the entirety of a novel, but the reader in this case gets to explore the concept of being with one's love forever. We also learn what can happen when your love asks you to end this eternity, knowing you are the only one who can. 
 It's an exploration of love. If you've ever wondering what you would do for the one you love, how far you would go, this book is a great read. Although, I do have to say, none of the characters are truly good, or innocent. There was no one whom I felt was perfect, or kind, or particularly kind. It's a cast of flawed characters, that's for sure. 
 (hide spoiler)]"
4,"I like that this is continuing to follow Raphael and Elena instead of jumping off to other couples; their relationship is one that's developing slowly over an extended period of time and it's really sweet to see him become a little more human. I also like to see her interactions with his Seven and we meet Noel, who is featured in the short story in Angels of Darkness. 
 I also like that while Elena trains hard and can keep herself from being killed she isn't suddenly all powerful - her immortality will take time to grow and strengthen her. Her drive to succeed is impressive, but she also knows when enough is enough. 
 As a side note, Michaela is a spoiled bitch and I get that they need her after they had to kill Uram, but will someone please actually punish her in a meaningful way?!?"
3,"3.5 stars 
 I really liked this book. It was a quick read, engaging, mysterious, and fun. Various little things bugged me (like some of the conclusions Nyx jumped to), and I wasn't crazy about the ending (though I won't say why to avoid spoilers). But overall, it was a very enjoyable read."
4,"Cliche and predictable, but the story is handled relatively well and I couldn't resist the cuteness and gorgeous art. Another plus is that the characters are kind, brave, and thoughtful kids who are honest and actually make an effort to communicate with each other, which is refreshing compared to other shoujos with endless angst and romanticized mean dudes."
5,NK Jemisin is perhaps the best working genre writer alive right now.
4,Love how sweet Eric is and how kind he is!
4,"This novella, which is a prequel to K.A. Tucker's powerfully brilliant Ten Tiny Breaths - but should be read after, NOT before TTB, broke my heart for poor Cole/Trent. In Her Wake tells the story of Cole just before and in the ensuing years after the accident that changed not only his life forever, but that of Kacey (who is the heroine in TTB). The reader gets to fully understand what happened, and the guilt that plagued Cole, which led to the change in his life, becoming Trent and reaching to atone for the overwhelming guilt he kept due to his role in the tragedy. 
 While this novella helped the reader to understand where Trent was coming from in TTB, and the reason he pushed Kacey so hard, it was really heartbreaking. I mean this guy never forgave himself the entire time he was secretly, from afar, pursuing Kacey. My heart just continued to break for him, until he hit rock bottom, and boy was that another stab in the heart. So, while I did love this novella, it is truly a prequel that could not really stand on it's own, without Ten Tiny Breaths. 
 Now for a re-read of Ten Tiny Breaths :)"
5,"Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. 
 I'm going to be honest. When I first started this, I dived into it all set up ready to point fingers at the manipulative maniac and feel sorry for the victim. As I dived deeper, I realized the book itself was a work of art, regardless of whether I approved of their behavior or not. It wouldn't help to condemn the characters and hold it against the book. As Oscar Wilde put it so wonderfully, 
 ""There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all."" 
 Nabokov, the author, himself says: 
 ""TherearegentlesoulswhowouldpronounceLolitameaninglessbecause itdoesnotteachthemanything.Iamneitherareadernorawriterofdidacticfiction,and despiteJohnRay'sassertion,Lolitahasnomoralintow.Formeaworkoffictionexistsonly insofarasitaffordsmewhatIshallbluntlycallaestheticbliss."" 
 And aesthetic bliss is all that it delivers. Contrary to popular belief, it is NOT erotica. And it is by no means a love story either. It merely a bittersweet, yet hilarious account of a tortured mind and twisted decisions that result in him tasting the richest flavor of hell. The wordplay is remarkably exquisite and all the novel demands is for you to enjoy it as the literary masterpiece it is without taking anything personally. 
 AndIshallbedumpedwheretheweeddecays, 
 Andtherestisrustandstardust. 
 In and out of my heart flowed my rainbow blood. 
 It was love at first sight, at last sight, at ever and ever sight. 
 And finally, my favorite, which is of a scene where he entertains himself with thoughts of drowning a certain woman who messes with his plans: 
 ""It was like some dreadful silent ballet, the male dancer holding the ballerina by her foot and streaking down through watery twilight."" 
 I wouldn't recommend this for everybody(hell, it took me almost a month since I kept puking in my mouth every time I heard words like nymphet or nymphancy), but anyone who can appreciate it for its ingenious writing will surely come to love it gradually."
2,Graphic erotica that I was forced to read by a friend - a shamefully addictive series.
3,"3,5 stars. I liked the second half more."
3,"(3.5 stars) What a strange, diverse, unique, heartbreaking little book this is. I can't possibly pigeonhole this into any one genre, or describe it in simple terms. 
 Don't take my rating too literally. The romance (and some overly verbose prose) was pretty much all that brought this down. If anything, read this for the beautiful writing and crushing characters. Ugh. BEAU. WHY?"
4,"This book flew by! All of these books are highly addictive and I want to read Origin as soon as possible! I can't believe I'm already more than halfway through this series! While I enjoyed reading it, I did have some problems so I'm giving this one 3.75 stars."
5,"Not too much description, and not too much dialogue. An easy prose where every word counts. A lesson in history that's still a moving fictional piece. A fun read that deserves a place among classics. 
 The author uses simplicity and subtext in her creation of a sentimental tale about the important things in life. I loved the old-timey vocabulary and subtle dialect from the 1930s, and felt immersed in the protagonist's world, regardless of her age. The spells of dry humor are just my style. 
 If the prequel is this good, I wish I would have read that first!"
4,"Check out this review and more at Such a Novel Idea 
 I received this book for free from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review. 
 Disclaimer: This is a review of a second book in a series. That means, there's probably something that refers to the first book. I'll try to keep it as free from book one spoilers as I can, but you've been warned. 
 Back in October 2014, I was on the tour for the first book in the Dark Caravan Cycle, Exquisite Captive. (Read my review here). So basically, I've been waiting a LOOOOOONG time to get my hands on Blood Passage. Even though I've had it for awhile, thanks to Edelweiss, I've held off reading, because I knew I would love it and the time until book three would be a lot farther off. And I can say, I definitely made the right decision, because I was completely sucked in! Luckily this book doesn't end on a cliff, so while I'll be pining for Freedom's Slave, it won't be from that precarious position of the tiny tree limb dangling over the river hundreds of feet below. 
 If I thought I loved the first book, I wasn't prepared for how much I'd enjoy book two. There is always the fear of sophomore book slump in a series, but this one definitely surpassed expectations. 
 First let's talk about the important stuff - the swoons. This book was swoony, and definitely blush-worthy. I LOVED how much more we got in this book. You guys, it's just <3 <3 <3. My heart was definitely flailing at times. Raif and Nalia had so much tension in the first book (since he started out hating her), so seeing them grow together (and apart at times) was rewarding. 
 We get to see some expansion on our world-building, as we're in Morocco looking for Solomon's sigil. AKA the thing that will give him power over all jinn. Not so good, especially when she's just regained her freedom from Malek. From the synopsis, you know Nalia is fufilling Malek's third and final wish, which was part of the deal for said freedom. But there is SO much more going on in this book than just that one wish -- and it adds so much to the series as a whole. Luckily, with the background of this 'world' and mythology from book one, it was a lot easier to understand the context of what was going on. I mention in my review of EC how much I relied on the guides Demetrios created regarding the jinns, but this time, I pretty much caught on from the very beginning of the book. We definitely see an expansion in the world and our characters, though, so it is a new and fresh perspective. There's lots of adventure and Demetrios does a wonderful job of creating vivid pictures in your mind. 
 So, a quick recap: Nalia is a jinn that has the ability to use all the elements to access power (most races of jinn only have control over one element). She was a survivor of an attack on her family and the ruling class of jinn (someone said this loosely mirrors the life of Anastasia Romonov if she had survived, which I think is a great way to look at it), but was tricked into slavery by Malek. While doing his bidding, she manages to fall for Raif who leads the resistance. He also wants the magic relic to tip the scales in his favor and win freedom back through revolutionary means. So, Raif, Malek, and Nalia are all racing to find to an ancient object. 
 Speaking of perspective, this one featured four main characters, including Nalia. Getting into the heads of Raif, Zanari, and Malek was exactly what was needed in this second book. I hate when a POV is added unjustifiably later in a series, but absolutely love it when it helps develop the story more completely. Getting to know the two male protagonists was good since they are so central on this quest, but Zanari added another layer to the story. To be honest, I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy her scenes, but I will never tire of hardcore girl characters, and Z is definitely one of them. And even though you don't really like Malek, understanding him was necessary. He's definitely a complex character rather than just an outright bad guy. There's a hint in the synopsis about his past coming back to haunt him, and having that perspective in there is the only way to really let it all play out. I also continued to love Nalia. She's already been through a lot and she goes through even more during Blood Passage, but she continues to grow as a character and on me. 
 This book took me places I never expected to go emotionally. There is a ton of action in Blood Passage, so definitely buckle up your seatbelt for a rollercoaster of emotions. I started this in my tent while I was camping with my family, and very much hated having to stop it to sleep (hiking without rest is NOT a fun way to spend a weekend). Definitely plan accordingly, because once you get started on Blood Passage, you won't be going anywhere."
3,"Broadening my reading of popular urban fantasy with the first book in the Mercy Thompson series. 
 In terms of writing, characters and pace, this one was much better than the first Sookie Stackhouse book I read recently. On the other hand, this one's was all about werewolves, which I didn't find as fascinating at well written vampires. There was the obligatory violence, but not over the top, and surprisingly no sex. 
 Might be worth further reading if I come across vol #2 in the second hand store."
5,"First off, this book was nothing like what I expected it to be at all and I enjoyed it a lot more than I ever thought. I actually wound up staying awake past the time I was supposed to sleep just to finish this book. Prior to this, I had read two other zombie apocolypse books. World War Z and The First Days. Both of these books covered zombies. In ""The First Days"" it was set right during the breakout and followed two women. In ""World War Z"" it followed a reporter gathering facts to see how it impacted different parts of the world. Going into this book, I expected it to be similar to the latter. Boy was I wrong. 
 Feed tells the tale of a post-zombie America. The people have accepted the fact that there are the infected and are doing everything to move on with their lives. The book follows a group of bloggers during their campaign trail with a current contender for the next President of the United States. This is where it gets interesting. The story does have zombies but it reads much more like a political thriller with zombie elements. Halfway through the book, it really hits its stride and keeps going. 
 What I liked: 
 1. There was a scientific background for the sudden infection. In a lot of zombie books, the infection just seems to start out of nowhere. Feed gave a feasible explanation for where and how the infection was created and spread. YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW HAPPY THIS MAKES ME! 
 2. The portrayal of the news/media and how they handled the news of the initial zombie outbreaks. I felt that the author really captured what most major news networks would do if this ever does occur. The reactions of the people turning to blogs is something that I can actually see happening along with the power and influence the internet wields in this book. 
 3. The snippets from the blog posts throughout the story really brought things together and I loved all the characters. 
 What I didn't like: 
 1. The SCREENINGS/TESTS! I understand the necessity for all of it but I think that after we got the initial idea about how they were conducted it was no longer necessary to go into detail every time. 
 2. Why why WHY does Georgia have to take her sunglasses off EVERY FREAKING TIME. To my understanding, one's entire life is recorded within your file so every time she is stopped they should know about her condition. Plus, it is not as if her condition is extremely rare. From reading sections of this book, it seems fairly common in the population. Which is why I don't understand why she is treated the way she is whenever someone questions her. If someone had a disease of some sort in which exposure to light could permanently damage your brain, you would not casually ask them to expose themselves to danger all the time. 
 Anyway, overall I really enjoyed this. I would recommend it to people who want to get their feet wet with zombie stories since it is a cross between a political thriller + zombies. Also for people who are interested in the media/internet/blogging and the effects that it has on society."
5,"Oh my goodness... such a compelling and evocative story. The island of Thisby is a hard and lonely place most of the year, but in October, things heat up for the annual Scorpio Races along the dangerous shorelines. More than a horse race, this is the island's celebration of mastering the capaill uisce-- the bloodthirsty water horses that can occasionally be lured from the sea. There is plenty of fight-to-the-death action, as riders and their mounts prepare for the annual November 1 race, but the real story is about so much more: family and love and not backing down from what you believe in. Stiefvater's pacing is impeccable as she draws readers in to Puck's and Sean's developing relationship. Beautifully written: read it, read it, read it."
1,"It really wouldn't be air for me to give this book any official rating because i didn't finish it. In fact I didn't even get far. 
 I have read many of Tijan's novels and came to the conclusion that the main emotional focus for this author is ANGST. As much as possible, whenever possible. After the first novel i must admit that i was intrigued, but after the fifth i was annoyed. 
 Carter Reed is slightly different as far as i could tell but still i found that i couldn't focus on the story. Why? It would appear that Tijan couldn't resist the trend of sexual submission, and even though cleverly written it's problem is that it is just currently overused. Honestly i came only so far before I gave up. 
 The leading lady killed a guy and is asking for help, he asks her 'What did you do?' and moves closer, she gets instantly wet from his proximity. Then she gets disgusted with herself and tries to leave. He says 'Stop' and she instantly does, and gets even wetter. Then comes the inner monologue...'How come he has this affect on me?' That is the power of Carter Reed. 
 Tijan knows how to work the emotional roller coaster, but this was just so godamned cliche. I am honestly fed up with the saturation of BDSM in contemporary romances lately, and maybe that is the reason i look at this novel with a frown. So it didn't seem fair to give it a rating."
5,"""Love isn't supposed to make sense. It's completely illogical"" 
 You really know how much you love a book by how fast and eager you were to read it, to turn it's pages and devouring each things that happen, and how much you grew on the characters and at the end of the last page, you want more, moRE, MORE!. I absolutely had the same feeling about this one. I started late last night, and less than twenty-four hours later, I'm done, and I'm famished for more. 
 24 hours. Many things could really happen within 24 hours. I've been on a roller coaster of emotions while reading the book: crying and euphoric. Literally. I was so psyched into finally getting a copy and finally being able to read this after months of waiting. And I'm not disappointed. The story's basically about two people meeting on an airport, sharing a 7-hour flight, and ended up having sharing what seem like a lifetime with each other. Just like how the old lady who sat with them said ""Just like when you're young and in love, a seven-hour plane ride can seem like a lifetime"", more like a premonition of some sort. There were lots of ""butterflies in my stomach"" and ""toe-dip"" moments in reading the conversations between Oliver and Hadley. I know many of us are not fans of ""love at first sight"", and I myself don't believe in them. But it doesn't mean that first sight can't lead to something more. Total strangers as they may be, but there was just this undeniable sense of coziness and ""comfortability"" between Oliver and Hadley. I can't explain it, but I can totally see it in them. Even if they just met each other, they understand one another more than anyone else. 
 I also liked the parts that the story not solely revolved around the feelings they're developing, but also with the issues each of them carry in their hearts. The family connections, yes. However, I can empathize more with Hadley. She's actually attending his dad's wedding to a woman she never even met. There's this overwhelming sadness that burned into me whenever this thing is brought up. First, it's the small stories of how close she and her dad was. Then the whole problem slowly unravels. His dad never returned home after a semester of teaching in Oxford-yup! because of a girl. It brought lots of stuffs out of me. (I was seriously concerned with myself too). Questions like ""What's the sense of falling in love and marrying him/her and being happily married for many years only to find out that later on you'll fall in love again, with a different person, with a more kind of intensity of love? What's the point?"" So many divorces going on right now and it just saddens me because marriage is something that holds great value. It's not just making a family of your own, but there's just something pure in it. Anyway, I conclude to myself that the point is having to experience love. To experience love and loss and dealing with it..picking up the pieces and the part where we encourage or delude ourselves to thinking this is probably better this way. And for Hadley's part, in the end, with the help of something the presence of Oliver in her life kind of encouraged her, she let go. She loved her dad, and she chose to let him go. The good thing? He came back, because Hadley's still the most important thing in his life. (but he still messed up). However the fact that he's trying to fix things is one thing admirable..and it turns out the stepmum was nice and all.(okay i'm babbling). On the other side, Oliver's covered what I can say is an unhealed wound, only to be opened again when his dad died. His dad's a jerk, and all those years of not speaking up worn out on them when he died. He regrets not having s brought it up. but there was this time when his dad did something sweet to him, and I conclude that they could've patched their relationship, they would have come around, only if there were more time given to them. But the point is, meeting each other: Oliver and Hadley, seemed to be an unwished gift they both received. Sweet! 
 The ending was a real teaser though, but I kind of guessed the author wanted us to fill out the lines. She did, however, guided us to where the ending is. Since Oliver's studying near Hadley's...and he said ""Did you know that people who meet at least three different times within a twenty-four hour period are ninety-eight percent more likely to meet again?"" :). I guess love may be illogical, but it's all about timing. It all falls down to the right timing. What are the odds right? :)"
3,"Actual Rating: 3.5 stars 
 It seems like all the books I've been reading lately have been really hard to rate; I was constantly going between 2, 3, or 4 stars and I still don't know if I feel comfortable with this rating. I think my biggest issue with this book is that I want more of everything. The author only scratched the surface and I wanted her to delve deeper into the world she had created, more depth to her characters, more tension and chemistry, and definitely more world building. It was such a good start with a really intriguing concept, but it was shallow and sometimes a little boring. At times, it was a little hard to keep track of all of the characters and what was happening at the same time (perhaps this was my fault because it did take me quite the while to read this book), but there were so many perspectives that you had to keep tabs on and all of the characters and what their special abilities were. Also, when I read about a fantasy world, I expect there to be some world building, explaining about abilities, politics and so on; but this book was lacking in these necessary areas. As the reader, we're just thrust into this world without any prior knowledge about what witches are and their abilities or the politics of the world that is on the brink of war. You learn more as you go through the book but there are times you are grappling to understand what is going on. I'm not sure if I'm going to continue with this series, I will have to see how the reviews are for the second book first."
5,"This was amazing. (view spoiler)[Okay, I honestly would have preferred for it to have the sad ending, because it just makes much more sense, and it makes it more memorable over the sea of HEA in M/M romance, but I'm not mad at the HEA either. (hide spoiler)] Still pretty f*cking amazing, though."
3,"This book ran a little hot and cold for me. I couldn't really connect with any of the characters within it, but soon learned that humanity was more of the protagonist (and, possibly, antagonist) in this particular case. 
 A team of humans from Earth and Mars are exploring Rama, a strange, round world of some type that carries unusual beings and landmarks unlike any seen on earth. 
 I particularly liked the comments regarding Cook's expeditions in comparison with the crew of the Endeavour."
5,"Okay, this was extremely long book but i enjoyed every bit of it. lol. Sebastian is a total psycho freak. poor magnus and alec, i hope they work things out. hopefully simon and izzy figure things out as well. im happy for how it turned out for maia and jordan, also clary and jace, though they still have to work things out. Anyways, a really great book. i can't wait until the last one. :)"
5,"*Read way way back! Maybe in 2013!* 
 Wait.. I never reviewed this book? 
 I can't believe that. 
 This was basically my absolute love book 
 Perfect. Funny. Oh so funny. Sexy. Smart. Hot. 
 I LOVED McKenna, even to this day I love her. 
 And Chris!!! *sigh* 
 The whole video game madness.. Uggh I loved this book."
4,"This is a very lovely, non traditional romance with just the kind of HEA to make me sigh. It does deal with the subjects of loss, betrayal and childhood sexual abuse."
5,"As always, the creativity and imagination of this writing team blew me away. You will constantly be surprised by this series. So excited for the next volume!"

4,"Parasite tells the story of Sally (Sal) Mitchell, a young woman in her mid twenties recovering from a terrible car accident in the not-too-distant future. It is because of the new medical standards of this future that Sal survived her accident. Because of SymboGen, a pharmaceutical company of the future which offers a solution to illness, cancer and strife through a little tiny pill and one big trade off: Those who take the pill accept that they will become host to a parasite--a tapeworm-- that will live within them and keep them healthy. 
 It is because of this medical miracle that Sal has survived her accident, however it also becomes the main source of conflict in the novel as this salvation humanity has so willingly accepted begins to rebel against them. As scores of people across the world begin falling victim to a sudden ""sickness,"" Sal finds herself in the midst of a dark and dangerous journey in which she learns first hand that some truths are impossible to come back from. 
 I really loved the majority of this book! The story was suspenseful, and while I did see some of the twists coming during the story, there were entirely different twists that really threw me for a loop. Right up until the end, I wasn't entirely sure who to trust and what decisions Sal would make in the end. One of my main gripes with the story was that I felt like it just wasn't horrific or suspenseful enough. At times it felt like Mira Grant wanted to go a step further in the situations she created, but at times they felt a little lackluster. This however changes dramatically in the last half of the book, in which things become a bit more dark and a lot more violent - which makes me think the rest of the trilogy will be a lot darker. 
 I also had a gripe with Sal for the majority of the first half of the book. I felt at times that she was being willfully ignorant. There is a point where she's basically told what is happening outright, but she actually forces herself to forget that she's learned it at all until the final conflict of the story. However, in the end, Sal did win me over because she did become a stronger character by the end of the story - and she actually took a firm stand and made a choice of her own, which I honestly wasn't expecting to see until a later book in the series. 
 All in all, this book was entertaining and thrilling and the premise of it is certainly horrifying in and of itself. Who wants to think about having a tapeworm inside them at all - let alone about a potential future in which we infect ourselves with the parasite willingly in order to ensure our continued health. And the fact that these creatures begin to resent against their hosts? Horrifying to think about. I'm really excited to see which directions Grant takes the story next."
4,"First we have Camille who is a Seattle college student in Paris escaping for her birthday to a long awaited dream to visit Paris. A chance meeting and cue sexy Gavin, however Camille is in no shape to be starting a relationship and this meeting is a brief intriguing encounter. Camille has an abusive boyfriend back in Seattle... 
 Next chapter we skip ahead 2 years to Camille working in a small Louisiana town and attending school. After returning home from Paris she finally got wise and ditched the scum. Now here is the aspect about the book that I didn't care for at all... we find Camille again in an abusive relationship. I have seen with emotional, verbal, and physical abuse most of my life, knowing and loving a victim of this type of abuse I know firsthand the emotional fall out. I love that the author is bringing this up as I know lots of teenagers struggle with body image and self-confidence however this is a very tricky topic to write about in a young adult/adult romance novel. I think the character or her best friend needs to have a bit more knowledge on how to deal with a victim. In NO WAY am I saying the author condones or glorifies the subject, in any case I didn't feel it captures enough outrage that this is going on... make sense? I hope so... 
 Then we are taken on a Journey of discovery with Camille as she breaks up with scum #2 and a whirlwind romance with the supernaturally sexy Gavin. Camille has to navigate through the discovery that vampires exist and that some are closer than she realized. 
 Now here is the other issue I have with the book, I didn't connect with the characters or understand some of their actions. I didn't get emotionally involved with the characters, but this could be quickly solved with an edit. Also this is the first in the series so I am extremely interested in what book 2 will bring in April. 
 With all that being said I would still recommend this series, the world is unique and vampires are a bit different, not allot but enough. 
 I would recommend mothers read this with their older daughters; it is wildly entertaining and a chance to talk about a deeper topic. 
 Rating - 3.5 Stars 
 P.S. I found this AMAZING looking model named Arthur Keller and I just couldn't stop finding amazing pictures of him. The even better thing about sexy Gavin was he has a couple looks the casual look and the dressed to kill look, soooooo I have to show you both! Plus I happen to have found both looks! Enjoy...

1,"First, I was expecting something different for some reason. There are few things worse than expecting x and getting y. Often it doesn't matter how much better y is than x, you were expecting x therefore y isn't as good in your opinion. 
 I suspect that unmet expectation is flavoring my review of Station Eleven. The first few pages were incredible. Dynamite in writing. Elegant. Beautiful. Then I got up around page 5 (not kidding and in the large print version) and starting having trouble with the writing. The writing quickly went from austounding to adequate to conventional. I started to skim, seeking something interesting or entertaining or worth keeping me going or catching enough that I'd go back and read the intersecting pages. Nope. 
 I did read it front to back, finally, and it was work because there wasn't any ""there"" there. I found myself going ""Yeah, so?"" more often than not and not a good thing for a reader to do. 
 FWIW, readers familiar with my reviews probably know I read for much more than the story itself, so we go back to my first paragraph. This may be a great book for most, wasn't for me. So it goes."
5,"Beatrice Lacey, the daughter of the Squire of Wideacre struggles with gender barriers in 18th century England. Her unable brother, Henry, is set to inherit the family estate upon their fathers death. However Beatrice believes that she is would make a better leader than Henry. Beatrice must decided how far she is willing to go to achieve her dream of being a Squire of Wideacre and if the ends justify the means. 
 I have read ""Wideacre"" by Philippa Gregory twice and still love it! It is one of my favorite books (hence it's 6-star status!). Beatrice does a great job of narrating the book and it gives the reader a different perspective. Most books that are told from first person point of view are often told from a persons perspective who the reader likes and this is not the case. As a narrator, Beatrice explains all of her actions and the thought process behind them, which helps the reader stomach it is certain situations. For those who read the book and believe that (view spoiler)[ the incest is an example of how sick Beatrice is I disagree with you. It shows how far she is willing to go to be Squire. I view it as a commentary on the time period and how society restricted women to household roles that they were forced to act like this. Beatrice stated on several occasions said that she did not like doing this but viewed it as 'her rent' for still living on Wideacre. (hide spoiler)] 
 Overall I loved this book, and the other ones in the series for that matter, and loved the depth of character that Gregory included."
3,"This was a light quick read. I enjoyed the first half quite a bit but it petered out towards the end. Maybe because I thought it was a romance, though it does have romantic interest, it didn't really go there in the end. Possibly it will in the rest of the series."
4,"4.5 stars. An excellent original novel with some great world building inside the sinister garden. Recommended. 
 'The only thing that made me truly different was that I was the only one who never cried. 
 Who never could. 
 Fucking carousel.'"
3,"for me the whole book is like fuck-kill-fuck-kill 
 i just enjoyed the epilogue"
4,"When I read this when I was 17, it was my favorite book. I loved the idea of sex as a goodness, shared with people you love, and I loved the recognition of the divinity within all living things, but rereading it now, I find myself not loving it as much as I used to. The free love thing is a little hard to swallow being in a monogamous relationship now, and ... I don't know. I'm not the same person I was when I read it at 17, and this book doesn't fulfill the needs me at 27 has."
4,"I really liked this book. More on the YA side, but the story was great. I'm still not sure how I feel about Jared. He is a really good guy, don't get me wrong,there's just something about interfering that doesn't sit well with me. :\ 
 Claire was just a character in this book for me. She didn't stand out a lot, and was just there to fill in a story line. 
 I really liked Ryan, and I really hope he finds a better destiny than the one that was previously determined for him. 
 I'm really curious to see what Requiem is all about!"
3,"People tell me I have a short attention span. They mention, on some rare occasions, that I tend to space out easily. That one moment I'll be listening and paying attention and the next moment... Oh sparkly! With that I'm lost! It's amazing how many teachers have been the ones to remind me of my poor ability to pay attention. Remarkable really... 
 What was I saying? 
 Oh yeah! So it takes a little bit to capture my attention and to keep it. Usually an abnormal amount of sex, violence or suspense will do the trick. Or if the writing is super-duper fabulous! 
 (By the way, if only you knew how many times I've gotten distracted and forgotten to keep typing, you'd be surprised! Or maybe not...) 
 Anyway, point of the matter is that Marr has my number. She knows what people like me are like. It's insidious really. Her nefarious schemes to keep my wavering attention with sex and horror have not gone unnoticed though! I'm onto her! What does she think of her audience? That they'll overlook the TERRIBLE editing job and shaky story-telling with sex? 
 Okay, so maybe it worked a little... just a little bit. Because every time you start getting bored, some hot guy starts putting the moves on, or his fingers start roaming, or flirting starts happening. That, or you think you're about ready to yawn and some evil person shows up and starts hurting other things. 
 It took me a little while to get what she was doing. What with the oral sex and the obvious lust inducing moments, it was hard to force my brain into action. I had to keep refocusing, shaking it off and trying to see the book for what it was as opposed to imagining half-naked men with incredible bodies all oiled up and posing... 
 Okay, never mind, back to the point. In a market flooded with cookie-cutter YA paranormal and Urban Fantasy novels, this one is trying to be different. It's trying to be contrary. Marr must figure that if fails, at least there's lots of pretty to look at. 
 Well, it did fail to be different. It was entirely forgettable. In fact I'm having trouble remembering everything already and I just finished it today. I suppose of course that if it wants to fall back on pretty sparkly men (oh, I'm sorry, this one GLOWS. It's different, see? At least this one doesn't try to hide the fact that he's a fairy) that's ITS prerogative, however on a hawtness scale of 1 - 10, I rate Keenan and Seth a bit, fat, walloping 'meh'. How could they possible compare to Clayton? Or Barrons, V'Lane or Howl, Christoph, Con or any of the other REAL literary crushes I have! 
 In fact I've had to create a whole new bookshelf in honour of this book. I'm calling it my 'Meh' Shelf. It's for books like this one (don't be deceived by the stars, it's not really 3, it's 2 1/2) that aren't terrible, aren't fantastic, and that I'll barely remember in a week or so. 
 So if you want to read some fairly PG schmexing and some interesting Fae mythology then go ahead. Give it a shot. 
 Maybe if I keep reading books like this, I'll cure my insatiable fascination with sparkly things. It's what got me into this trouble to begin with. I was looking for a diamond in the rough but this book was pretty much mostly rough."
4,"*2nd read! I think this series is better the second time around! And changing to 5 stars* 
 Original review: 
 4 Stars because it's Kristen Ashley, and she is hands down one of my favorite authors. The story is good, hate to say a little predictable, but no one writes an alpha like Kristen imho. I have enjoyed all the books in the Colorado Mountain series."
3,"This is not a bad book, but... I've never really liked Aeron -he always came across as sanctimonious. I didn't warm up to him here. He's loyal and protective of his friends & ""daughter"" yada, yada. Still. Don't like him. I liked his dick joke, though. One of the rare moment he wasn't uptight. Olivia was more likeable. She's strong and goes after what she wants, like most of the heroines of the series. She also has a healthy dose of humour. She's perfect on paper but she was a bit flat. I was not feeling the chemistry between her & Aeron. I still don't understand what she saw in him. 
 Ok, let's get to what makes this book good: the plot twists & the secondary characters. If this book had been a film, I'd have been glued to the screen. There were so many things I didn't see coming! The plot got more layered & complex. I love all the new revelations & the introduction of new characters. The author uses her cast deftly & keep the plotlines of all her characters moving along nicely in each book. I want to jump to the next book of the series as soon as I've finished reading one. I have high hopes for Gideon. He's been amazing thus far, and the surprise at the end of the book... Have to read his book NOW! 
 I have to mention Strider, too. OMG! He's fantastic! I LOVE him. Can't wait for his book and reading more about the Stridey Monster. LOL 
 Talking about secondary characters (view spoiler)[ William/Gilly makes me uncomfortable. They're not together. William doesn't want to be with her *now* but... I hope it won't go that way. 
 There was something between Legion/Galen, right? I have a feeling he was falling for her. Whoa. That's interesting. I hope this is developed further. 
 Sienna coming back as Wrath's Keeper I don't look forward to. But it could be interesting. (hide spoiler)]"
5,"Scarlet by A.C. Gaughen is the newest Robin Hood retelling. Y'all, I love the story of Robin Hood and I was extremely excited to pick this book up. I am happy to tell you that Scarlet more than lived up to my expectations! It has a comfortable spot on the list of best fantasy books I've ever read. 
 In Scarlet, the main character is a well known Robin Hood character re-imagined as a girl. She is fierce and loyal - such a fantastic character. But she definitely has some skeletons in her closet that are about to come back and bite her - and her friends - big time. When the sheriff hires someone to come in and catch the folks behind all the stealing going on - things get complicated fast. What will Scarlet, Robin Hood and the rest of their gang do? 
 Scarlet is prickly, grouchy and extremely touchy. She doesn't trust easily and has a hair trigger temper. She lies as easily as she breathes. I love the fact that she isn't a run of the mill heroine. She will not be what you expect, and it is a wonderful surprise to discover all the ins and outs of her personality. Oh man do I love her! 
 I also love how she and Robin interact - the romance here is a slow burn. Extremely satisfying when it comes to a head. You will not be disappointed - promise. 
 Basically everything is well written - from the plot intricacies to the characterization of everyone involved. A.C. Gaughen definitely impressed me you guys! None of the characters are perfect (including Robin) and nothing is as easy as it seems. The plot twists have plot twists and some of them are difficult to read - you'll be wanting to cover your eyes before the story is done! 
 I seriously cannot recommend Scarlet by A.C. Gaughen enough. I will definitely be getting a copy to add to my shelves when it is released in February!"

 Actual rating: 3.75 stars. 
 This is a difficult book to review, just like it's a difficult book to categorize. It has religious undertones, but it's not necessarily a story about religion. It doesn't seem like the typical young adult historical fiction novel (and it really isn't), but that doesn't mean it's not compelling in its own right. 
 It's about Dolssa, but it's not, actually. 
 You heard me correctly. Despite the title of this book implying a recount of Dolssa's sufferings, this novel is actually about the community Dolssa affects with her presence when she is taken in by three sisters while being pursued by a friar. It's about how you don't know where you're headed, and, sometimes, you need the right people to get you where you need to go. 
 The Passion of Dolssa is a subtle novel in every way. Subtle in character development, subtle in its characterization of the townspeople, subtle in its impact. It's one of those novels where, slowly, you see all the pieces fitting together, and you can't help but smile, because how could you not have seen it before? Such subtlety and gentleness made it difficult for me to get invested in this book, but eventually I got there. 
 I wish I could have connected to the characters sooner. I wish we had more page time with them so I could get to know them more intimately, Dolssa especially. However, I enjoyed what we did see, and I was eventually able to get invested in the lives and well-beings of these characters with time. I still think about these characters from time to time, even though I read the book several months ago. 
 Another thing that threw me off a little was the language usage in this novel. It takes place in the thirteenth century, so obviously language was very different. This book did a great job of integrating various terms and phrases into the novel that really reinforced the book's setting and atmosphere. I just wish I didn't have to turn to the glossary as much as I did (which, granted, was not often, but still). I'd rather have that energy invested in immersing myself in the story. (Very personal preference, though. If you're okay with glossaries in fantasy novels, you'd be fine with this; I'm pretty sure the glossary in this book was neither overwhelming nor overly extensive.) 
 Finally, the ending confused me. (And made me sad, to be honest; I know that things don't always end happily, but...why? I was finally satisfied, but then that satisfaction was snatched from me. It was disheartening. :( ) I wish I'd understood what was going on better in the last chapter or two. 
 Overall, though this book took a while for me to warm up to it, I very much enjoyed The Passion of Dolssa, and would readily recommend it to anyone interested in an atypical YA historical fiction novel-one that not only includes religion, but shows both the bad and good sides of faith. Expect this novel to grow on you, though; don't expect it to hook you in right away. 
 But if it does? That's great, too."
3,"This series is one genre cliche after another, yet somehow it manages to rise above its hackneyed characters and recycled plotlines. Characters are fun without being over the top and Probst's writing has real warmth to it. There is something endearing about an author who compares one of her heroes to a bowl of cereal.

3,"Seen at Bookish Antics! 
 I don't often read adult novels, but once I saw that Lauren Oliver had one coming out about ghosts I couldn't help myself. I will read anything and everything Oliver writes because she writes some of the most gorgeous prose I've read. Rooms follows that trend and is a beautifully written, slow-moving novel about how the echoes of the past never truly die out. This is not a plot-driven, action-packed novel, but it is a carefully thought-out character study that is really in-depth and magnificent. 
 There are ghosts in the Walker home, ones that seem to inhabit every single room spreading their influence everywhere. When Richard Walker dies, his family moves in to help settle his estate and other important matters. The problem is that the Walkers don't get quite along and that they're harboring more than a few secrets. 
 Rooms takes the idea of having a past filled with ghosts and explores it both metaphorically and literally to excellent results. What does it feel like to be trapped inside one place and to never escape? The ghosts, Alice and Sandra constantly have this dilemma and desire some sort of closure to their banal existence. This duo is constantly trapped in the past, while the Walkers are constantly trying to forget their pasts and just move on. Alice and Sandra are constantly ruminating on their prison and home, which led to extremely poetic, thought-provoking sentiments that will set readers minds ablaze. 
 This book is all about the characters and Oliver establishes these chaotic characters by showing the messy and complex sides of them. From Caroline who is an alcoholic and is driven to grief by the loss of her husband to Minna who is bitter and can't seem to foster a relationship and Trenton who is more content by himself. These characters are insanely real and it's easy to get drawn into their lives and problems. The character that I related to the most was definitely Trenton because I felt a certain bond with him and was truly scared for him throughout the novel. Trenton has to deal with his inner demons and Oliver brings these brutal struggles to life without mitigating them by making them more palatable. 
 Rooms is a slow novel that is filled with long-buried secrets and it takes a bit of time for this novel to take off, but it's totally worth it. Once all the pieces fall into place, it becomes obvious that this slow buildup was necessary and intricate details that were previously presented become more important on a larger scale. I loved how effortlessly the stories intertwined and how the pieces came together to show the Walker family in such a revealing way. 
 Lauren Oliver's latest novel may not appeal to some of her teen readers with its slow moving plot and themes about dealing with the past. More mature teen readers will definitely embrace Rooms and this is yet another superb novel from a super talented author. I hope this isn't Oliver's last adult novel because these novels definitely have crossover appeal and Rooms was such a wonderful, yet depressing read."
3,"3.5 stars rounded down, because imo it's not fresh enough to be worth the hype. 
 (view spoiler)[Interesting that the father was *almost* a drunk, and *almost* abusive. And the other children in Rose's class were *almost* mean. Honestly, I appreciate that - I swear, too much 'realistic' fiction will give kids in happy families a terror of leaving them for the ""real"" world. That is, too many novels focus on drama, and most lives are pretty mundane and more happy than not. 
 But in this case, somehow things seemed a little off. A tighter focus on Olivia, and maybe more about Parvani and Weldon, would have been welcome and helpful, I think. 
 And I found it frustrating that the wonderful picture on the cover illustrated a scene not in the book, and unlikely to have occurred at all in Rose's time with Rain. (hide spoiler)] 
 If you do decide to teach this, encourage your students to come up with homophones themselves. Several easy ones were left out, like great, and bear, and they're.... 
 Btw, as it happens I recently read Belle Teale and that is a better book, imo."

 I received a copy of this book for review from the publisher. This does not influence my thoughts on the book or this review. 
 I loved Stephanie Perkins' winter anthology, My True Love Gave to Me, and I knew I'd love her summer anthology. In the same vein as the first anthology, Summer Days & Summer Nights is a cute anthology perfect for a day at the beach or wanting to escape the harsh sun while reading all about it. 
 The authors in this anthology were just fantastic; Tim Federle and Nina LaCour wrote amazing LGBT romances, Stephanie Perkins delivered a follow-up to her short story from the first anthology, Lev Grossman created a wonderful and mind-bending world that was existential but deeply romantic, Jon Skorvon created a narrative that had more than one romance and much more. 
 I won't review every single story because I don't want to give away any details, the stories are short enough that I think part of the magic is discovering them. But I will say that I enjoyed most of the stories. I was pleasantly surprised by how some of the stories had elements of fantasy, but all the stories were deeply romantic. 
 Overall, I highly recommend Summer Days & Summer Nights to those looking for heart-warming and unique stories that are perfect for a day on the beach."
4,"3.5 stars 
 A bit slow-paced, but all in all the story moved at a comforting pace. I enjoyed the road trip aspect of the book, especially the play lists! One thing I could relate to the most was Amy's constant fear of accidents because I worry about that all the time, so it was definitely something I could bond with Amy in the story. I'd hoped that we could find out more from Amy's brother and mother - does Charlie get better? Do they recover eventually as a family? But I guess that's a story for another time."
5,"This is one of those feel good books that can be a part of one's library to read and reread from time to time. This is a book about the love of books, and about sharing this love. It's also a book about love and about embracing it no matter the fear you experiment before. 
 In a way, it reminds me of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society in both its love of books and the exchange of letters. In the discovery of a new and small society through books and in the joy of sharing the love of books. 
 There are lots of highlighted parts in my book, and I know I will read and reread these sentences and paragraphs every so often, just to feel I can share this love with someone else, someone who maybe lives in the other end of the world."

 Rating 
 : 3 
 The Low Down 
 : Rose and Lissa, a mortal vampire, have been caught. On the run for two years, they are returned summarily to St. Vladimir's Academy where they go to school. Why they left is the mystery that slowly unfolds in this tale of Moroi royalty, their Dhampir protectors, and the dangerous Strigoi, the immortal vampires. Is the very school that is supposed to protect them - not? 
 Rose is Lissa's protector. Though still only a student, she is certain that once she graduates, she will be assigned to her best friend. Rose is the only one who knows of Lissa's ability to heal. Then dead animals cross Lissa's path, and since she is tied to the earth, she feels bound to save them. But to what cost? Will she lose her mind? 
 Lissa used to be part of the popular crowd - the royalty and their hangers-on. She decides to rejoin the group to see if she can learn anything out about these dead animals and who is doing this to her. What most don't know is in addition to being able to heal, she can also use compulsion on people to get them to do what she wants. 
 What did crazy Mrs. Karp mean about Lissa needing to keep everything a secret and to trust no one? Is jealous mean girl Mia behind the attacks? Does the mysterious and shunned Christian really care about Lissa? And what is up with Dimitri, her trainer and mentor? She can't stop thinking about him. And she thinks he may think of her, too. 
 Best Thang 'Bout It 
 : This book had just the right balance of dark and romance. The main characters, and just as importantly, the secondary characters, are very well developed. The mystery was well-crafted and the identity of the villain was a surprise. Rose is confident, a bad-girl-with-a-conscience who would fiercely protect Lissa no matter what. Rose's bravado, though, seems to be a little bit of a front. They have a special connection that allows Rose to know if Lissa is ever in danger. Lissa is less interesting, but has many compelling issues as well. 
 I'm Cranky Because 
 : There was almost too much hate for Rose by the students. Also, I didn't completely understand the hierarchy. I'm not big on class separation, either. Very small complaints, all. Lastly - it may be a little confusing at the beginning, like you are missing some prior chapters, but that is the intention. There's more than one mystery in these pages. 
 Should You? 
 : If you need a new twist on vampires, where there are not one but two kinds, good and bad, then put down that run-of-the-mill tale and pick this up.

5,"This book takes place in 1876 in a small town in the Sierra Nevada settlement, it revolves mainly around the town's Witch and a misplaced, well to do, insufferable, New York Warlock. Our heroine finds a lost relic of great magical significance and after realizing that it is very dangerous (and coveted) she must flee with the insufferable Warlock (named Dreadnought...what a ridiculously epic name) to safety. They have many a great adventure, near death occurrences, magical interludes, and of course like it says on the book's cover...romance. This book came recommended to me through Goodreads.com since I listed Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell as one of my favorite books and I am glad it was recommended! It is part one in a four part (I think, it might be three) series and it mixes the elements of Steampunk, Sophisticated 'scientific' magics, and native 'old world' magic really well. Usually I like a small amount of romance in the plot with lots of banter and character development (like most fantasy books have) and this one had just the right amount. I adored Dreadnought, he was delightfully snarky and sarcastic!"
3,"ORIGINAL REVIEW HERE 
 I honestly feel that fantasy has taken a back seat these days when it comes to books that are being published and I find this to be extremely sad. When I first saw the cover for Throne of Glass, the beautiful cover intrigued me. Would it sound as good as the cover looked? Turns out, not only did Throne of Glass by Sarah J. Maas (who is gorgeous herself, y'all) have a great description, the book itself was really good. Throne of Glass was a great read with a kick ass assassin, mystery, world building and a love triangle that actually worked. 
 The plot: Political drama full of scheming and poisoning and placing bets and over throwing of governments and rebels! I swear, everything you WANT in a good fantasy world was in this book. First, the main protagonist is an assassin, something you don't always see in books these days. Then, there's a contest where more assassins and killers and thieves from all over the kingdom come to see how will be the King's Assassin! Add in some mysterious deaths and fantasy folklore and you've got Throne of Glass. The book itself is HUGE and I was happy about that. Though it moved slowly sometimes, I was able to get a better feel for the world and the characters and what was really happening in the story. 
 The writing: I'm actually on the fence with this one. While I liked the writing and how well it fit the characters and the world, I did feel that it wasn't as developed. Maybe even a little juvenile. No, I don't like it when authors use big words that have nothing to do with the book itself to make it sound sophisticated, I want there to be some depth. 
 The protagonist: Celaena is awesome, plain and simple. The first thing I liked about her was that she was kick ass assassin who had been caught and though she was still as good as they said she was, imprisonment had broken her a little. She was ruthless, yes, but fragile at the same time and the reader is able to see this. I wouldn't have liked her as much if she had sworn to never think about what had happened to her in the past because it really made her who she was. She saw thing differently after her imprisonment than she did before it. Not only is she a great assassin and she's willing to prove it, the girl likes to dress up. When she gets a chance to wear pretty dresses, SHE TAKES THE CHANCE. You have NO IDEA how happy this made me. Celaena wants to prove that she can be just as strong in a dress as she can be in more masculine clothes. Sarah J. Maas did a great job with Celaena! I did feel that she was very arrogant about her abilities and I didn't like this at first BUT when she began talking about her past, I realized that it was very much a cover. Sometimes, you just need to forget the demons of your past. 
 The romance: Of course, there was a romance in this book! A love triangle no less but it was a love triangle that I actually liked. Both Chaol and Dorian had aspects of their personality that I liked and it made them more likable. Both men have something to offer Celaena and bring out different aspects about her. For me, I liked Chaol a lot. While the romance with Dorian was sweet and cute, I felt that Chaol knew the reality of Celaena's life better. 
 The world: The interesting part about this book was that somehow, you learn more about the world through the eyes (and from) the characters themselves. The different countries and the kingdoms are described through the diverse cast of characters. There wasn't too much descriptions to bog down the reading but there was enough to satisfy the reader. In a fantasy novel that is part of a series or trilogy, I don't think the first book should ever completely get the world down flat. There should so a lot more about the world that the author needs to develop in the other books and I hope that this is exactly what Sarah J. Maas will do in the future novels. 
 Overall, Throne of Glass has a great protagonist who you will root for throughout the novel. There are times when you want to knock Celaena down from her high pedestal and other times, you feel for her. The world is amazing and the plot is terrific and this is an excellent fantasy novel. Sarah J. Maas delivers a wonderful debut that has been talked about for a reason!"
3,"Very solid read, though not nearly as winning as The Element of Fire. The main characters, while complex and interestingly drawn, did not capture my imagination the way that Thomas and Kade did."
3,"It's been a rather long time since I did that -- read a reasonable-length book in a single sitting. Last time I did that was...maybe Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince? In any case, it's been awhile since I read a true page-turner I wouldn't put down. (Although I'm certain the relative brevity of this book -- I have read Brandon Sanderson, Patrick Rothfuss, and the Wheel of Time lately -- had something to do its being awhile.) 
 How to describe this book plotwise? Think The Lottery meets reality TV, or think kids meet the gladiator arena. Basically, the one far-dominant nation-state in North America -- the Capitol -- has utterly subjugated twelve subordinate districts (and reduced a thirteenth to irradiated embers). Each district must annually send two ""tributes"" -- a male and a female between the ages of 12 and 18, chosen by lottery -- to fight to the death in the arena in the Hunger Games. The Games are a pageant from start to finish to entertain the Capitol, which eagerly watches (and forces the districts to watch) until one tribute remains (to be showered with honor for life, and whose district will be honored for that year). The arena itself is a massive tract of land under the total control of the Capitol -- terrain, vegetation, weather, and resources. The tributes learn skills and acquire supporters (who can sometimes send supplies), then they are deposited in the arena. It's a fight to the death -- first for a Cornucopia of supplies positioned at the arena entrypoint, then a protracted strategic dance to attack, and survive the attacks of, the other tributes. 
 A logical plot? Well, not entirely. The Capitol and districts occupy much of the United States and/or North America, but the impression is that at most total we're talking a few million people, with the rest of the area wild. Given the state of Capitol technology at least, this underpopulation is implausible. And it's hard to think the brutality of the Games a believable possibility in some distant future of our world. (Judged closer in proximity to the original gladiators, maybe. But evil today is generally much more subtle than it was back then -- or at least concerning the United States area particularly -- and I see little reason to believe that subtilty might disappear.) But it's enough to hang a story on it -- and a good story, too. The action comes steadily once the contestants enter the arena, and before then the slow reveal of the mechanics of the game remain captivating. The heroine's cleverness abounds, in a way that naturally fits her youth (and probably would not fit an older, wiser character), and the tactics are a pleasure to consider. 
 This said, this remains a young-adult novel. The action is mostly for action's sake. We don't learn enough of the underpinnings of the world to truly understand how it has come to be, or why it truly is so, or how it might be (at the far periphery, of course) even ambiguously ""moral"". We aren't left with much in the way of poignant questions to ponder, of the sort a far better book like Ender's Game (or even the later Harry Potter books) offers. The heroine has some depth, and some of the Capitol stooges surprisingly acquire a little personality by the end, but characterizations are mostly shallow. We're mostly left with a lot of grit (they're trying to kill each other, remember? and of course pageantry will demand it sometimes be brutal) and a dilemma that gets solved. Which is all perfectly fun, to be sure -- but it's not the sort of thing that would cause me to sidetrack reading a hundred pages of the book just because I happened to rearrange it on my bookshelf. (Which happens with all too much frequency for me...) 
 It was a two-month wait for the hundred-odd people ahead of me at the library to read this so I could borrow a copy; I'm currently 58 of 72 for the second and 22 of 31 for the third (having not considered that, given queue lengths, I should submit holds early, ""freezing"" holds if needed before they might prematurely vest). Will I wait for my name to move to the front of these queues to continue reading? It seems likely I will, rather than buy the later books to read them faster. I found the characters interesting, yet I'm not emotionally invested in them, and the ending is not a cliffhanger of the sort demanding immediate resolution. I can wait. 
 (...and, two weeks later, I find myself buying the entire series in Kindle editions on Amazon. Because the library queue is still huge, instant gratification is irresistible, and I keep having to watch out for spoilers when reading things online. Perhaps I should add another star...but no. This book was what it was, and needing to read further doesn't change that.)"
5,"** spoiler alert ** 
 My first reaction upon finishing this book: WOW!! 
 First off, let me say that Jodi Picoult is amazing. Her books are so emotional. I know that when I open up a Picoult book, I will not be reading a fluff chick lit. Her plots are so strong, and the characters never let me down. Jodi DEFINETLY does her research before she even thinks about writing. 
 My only pet peeve with Picoult's writing is the use of her expressions. Has anyone else notices how she uses the same ones much too often? Anyway, that's honestly my only complaint. 
 I started this book without knowing what it was about, the back of the book description was quite vague: ""an act of violence"" were the words to describe the horrific event which occurred. That's one of the great things about this book, I had imagined different things that could unfold before I started reading it, but I hadn't guessed a school shooting. 
 In fact, throughout the whole book I was guessing the reasons why such a tragedy happened, and more so, what was Josie's mysterious involvement? I also had not guessed this incredible twist. In the last five pages of the book, I literally put the book down and said ""are you kidding me?"" 
 This book was heartbreaking, and it amazes me how an author can write about a topic that is so challenging. When you hear about a school shooting, Columbine for example, the first thought that pops into your head is ""how could someone kill innocent high schoool kids.. he/she must have been evil."" We have this image in our heads of what a murderer looks like, and how he acts. We blame the parents for not bringing them up with enough compassion. This story is so beautiful because it shows you the other side. Although Picoult is not condoning Peter's actions, she is showing us that there is such a thing as a breaking point, that a normal family can produce someone who kills, that sometimes people are treated so miserably that they can't think of any other way to end it all permanently. 
 It's hard for me to sympathize with Peter because I have never been in his position, I could never imagine it. I have never had to feel total rejection, and I don't agree with his actions at all, but I can understand his logic, at least a tiny bit."
4,"This is a fairly original take on the fairy tale, Beauty and the Beast, enough so to encourage a read through of this book to those who enjoy fairy tale retellings. It's a little bit darker than the Disney version. Our Beauty is a hunter who wants more than to be a housewife. She doesn't want to be taken from the woods and outdoors. It also plays off the original tale in that Beauty, or Yeva as she is known here, has two sisters in addition to her father. They aren't shallow or wicked, however. They each are their own developed character and care for Yeva and the family as a whole. It was nice to read about a close-knit family in a fairy tale. The other side character, Solmir (Gaston in Disney version) isn't an incredibly vain villain but instead a nice guy who cares about Yeva and her interests. He's a great and pretty swoon-worthy guy. Since I've brought up all the other characters, I have to include Beast as well. I think he was developed very well-- we get to see how Yeva realizes how she truly feels for him. The book has small (.5-1 page) sections before each chapter told in Beast's point of view that really add to the story. In those small segments we see how Beast struggles with his existence, and it gives hints to what he actually is. (view spoiler)[Another fairy tale, ""Ivan and the Firebird"" is woven into the book, and really contributes to the books resolution. I thought it added another rich layer to make it more complex than a Beast under a spell that can only be broken by true love. (hide spoiler)] 
 Though Yeva is a hunter, the book isn't very action-y, but it isn't something I expect in a Beauty and the Beast retelling, so no qualms there. It focuses a lot on the characters discovering who they are and where they want to be in life. Again, definitely recommend if you like fairy tale retellings, but also maybe if you like YA fantasy romance."
0,"My reviews are first published on [a cup of tea and an armful of books]. 
 There are so many pieces to our story, pieces that, if taken away, might have changed the whole course of it. [...] And...it took all of us, our flaws and our desires. My hunger for power, which I will get to next. It was all in it, in our story, like the ingredients to a complicated recipe.* 
 Daughters of Mothers with Narcissism: Can the Cycle Be Broken?* 
 That is the name of the fictional paper that Emma in the Night keeps going back to explore: Can daughters escape a narcissistic cycle when it's the only thing they've known their whole life? Three years ago, Cass and Emma Tanner disappeared. When Cass comes back this cold case reopens, and with it comes things that Dr. Abby Winter tried so hard to forget. It was the case that stuck with her and now she has a chance to solve what happened the night that Emma and Cass disappeared. Something didn't add up to Abby then, and it doesn't add up now. As Cass weaves a story of betrayal, kidnapping, and lost time, Abby has to untangle the truth from Cass' words. Her return doesn't mean it's over. 
 I think there are two types of people. Ones who have a scream inside them and ones who don't. People who have a scream are too angry or too sad or laugh too hard, swear too much, use drugs or never sit still. Sometimes they sing at the top of their lungs with the windows rolled down. I don't think people are born with it. I think other people put it inside you with the things they do to you, or say to you, or the things you see them do or say to other people. And I don't think you can get rid of it. If you don't have a scream, you can't understand.* 
 Right from the start I had a bit of a problem with the characters. I thought that it was such a good idea to divide the narrative between the returned girl and the forensic psychologist who had initially been assigned the case. It gave the reader two different but connected perspectives. As much as Abby had studied and could diagnose elements of Cass' life, Cass was the only one who could give the reader the information. Unfortunately, she wasn't a reliable narrator. There's a certain thing that Cass knows that is revealed immediately to the reader. Abby's part consists of her trying to figure out what that is. The reader has to figure out what is the truth and what is Cass' imagination. I think that they were distinctly different voices, but I just didn't connect with either of them. 
 Part of the reason for that was the choice to write Cass' part in first person, but Abby's part in third person. Even though Cass' part should have been the one that was more immersive because it was first person, it wasn't. The main reason for this was the style. I felt like the entire book was told in an expository style, where the characters were telling us how they felt and what they did. It presented the story in a way that was told to me instead of putting me into the story. I kept waiting for the moment when I would be pulled in by the characters, and it never really came. Because it was telling, I felt that it kept me just a hand's-breadth away from being emotionally invested. I wanted to like this story because I like suspense, but this one just didn't pull me in. I was waiting for that moment. When it never came, it ended up being really disruptive to my reading experience. 
 As for the other characters, I only got a look at them through the lens of Cass and Abby. Each have their own way of seeing others. I liked Cass' half brother Witt, her father, Abby, and the agent working with her, but everyone else was pretty horrible. I had a little bit of sympathy for Emma for part of the novel, but as it advanced I really didn't like how she was portrayed. She wasn't a sympathetic character. Their mother was absolutely horrible. There were no moment where she was redeemed. I understand that there needs to be some sort of a ""villain"" in novels, even contemporary ones, but I like bad characters who are multifaceted. I wanted there to be more to Cass' mother than there was, but there wasn't. That may have been what the author intended, but I didn't particularly enjoy it. 
 ...something that felt like love was in her and she would take it out at times like this and show it to us and make us hunger for more.* 
 I did really like how narcissism was explored in this novel. I think that Walker did a good job of showing how the narcissistic mother influenced the growth of Cass and Emma. Because the focus of the novel was finding Emma, I found it more interesting when Emma was discussed because she was the chosen child. It was explained in the novel that the narcissistic mother often chooses one child who is both the chosen one and the competitor, and the other child looks for love from the chosen child. It's a horrible, messed up cycle, and it often does become a cycle. Abby is the child of a narcissistic mother, and she sometimes wonders if she and her sister escaped the cycle themselves. 
 I think that the things I really liked about this novel were sometimes overshadowed by what I didn't like. I was really intrigued to find out what exactly had happened and what was being hidden, but I had a difficult time getting through a lot of the exposition that the author was having the characters do. I felt like I was reading a confession rather than a story, and I couldn't quite get past that. I think that people who like contemporary mysteries will enjoy this one, but it wasn't completely for me. I enjoyed reading it, but it's not something completely memorable in my opinion.

5,"Dear Ms. Frost, 
 You complete me. Twice Tempted ALMOST made me forget about Bones and Cat. Which is HUGE. This book was everything I could wish for and more. 
 (view spoiler)[ At first...I was pissed at Vlad. After reading the first 20%, I was worried that I was going to have to stake Vlad myself. It was nearly as sad as when Bones left Cat at the salvage yard. 
 I even thought Leila should give Maximus a whirl because: 1. His name is fucking awesome. 2. I was SOOOO mad at Vlad for how cold he behaved towards Leila. 3. I was really really made at Vlad. But I got over being mad at him right around the time he told her he had the toilet put in his bathroom. It is the little things. sigh. (hide spoiler)] 
 But, Ms. Frost knows me and the book was 99.9999% perfect. (a smidge of a point off for no Ian. I mean, come on....I needs me some naughty Ian!)"
4,Loved it. This was a great series. Want more.
3,"Well it's time for a bit of winter cleaning. I reworked my ratings a bit (I removed most of those books from my feed so I don't spam), I been 2 and a half year on GR and my read list has grown 6 times since my first year here. books don't looks as good as they initially did and Mistborn is one of those series so I decided to reduce it's overall rating from 4 to 3 stars.Actualy most of Sanderon's books have rating reduced except Stormlight Archives which remains on my favorite shelf I knwo I will most likely bring Wrath of some Sandersonites but my I don't find him as good writer as I initially did. 
 Don't get me wrong he certainly isn't bad, he has some flashes of brilliance. Roshar is one of impressive places I read about and he remains The King of magic systems and I enjoy his books immensely but when I think of great storyline and intriguing characters his books don't come to my mind. Some books seem better in retrospect so few have ratings increased. 
 Summary of winter cleaning: 
 Mistborn trylogy: Sanderson 4->3 stars 
 Reckoners first two books: Sanderson 5->4 stars 
 Wheel of time first two books: Robert Jordan 3->2 stars 
 Belgariad: David Eddings 3->2 stars 
 Neverwhere 3->5 stars 
 The Last Warewolf: Glen Duncan 1->2 stars 
 City of Bones: Casandra Clare 4->2 stars 
 Fever series: Karen Marie Moning 3->2 (more like 1.5) 
 Best served cold: Joe Abercrombie 3->4 stars 
 American Gods: Neil Gaiman 5->4 Stars 
 Slow regard of silent things 5->4 stars 
 The Black Company 5->4"

3,"Just re-read this for my family book club, talk about an interesting discussion. I originally gave the book 4 stars. It didn't hold up as well on re-read. The shock factor has a lot to do with the gripping quality of the book. It's flaws become much more apparent when you know what's going to happen, however most of what I wrote below still applies. 
 Original Read on 9/1/2012 
 Very adult content, not for the faint of heart. This book is disturbing on many levels. It's not for everybody. In fact, I think it's mass appeal is probably pretty limited. On top of that the book is flawed. Although the writing is more or less solid, the character motivations are a bit strained. In other areas there is a fair amount of contrivance. 
 So why four stars? Because the book is powerful. Because it's haunting. Because, and here some will probably brand me a sicko, in some ways it's beautiful. Look, I don't expect everyone to get it. But there is a segment of the population (and not just the monsters) that can relate to this book. 
 Society tells us we aren't supposed to like this book, and honestly I have to say that in general, a society that condemns it is ultimately a better one than a society that embraces it. Still, there's deep stuff here if you can get past societal expectations. 
 Anyway, I'm going to quit before I really dig a hole for myself."
4,"""Playing Possum"" by Charlaine Harris: Fast moving story involving an armed gunman in Sookie's nephew's (Hunter) elementary school. The main appeal for me was the interactions between Sookie and Hunter. Very cute kid. 4 stars. 
 ""Spellcaster 2.0"" by Jonathan Maberry: Concept was interesting, lots of different places Maberry could have taken it, but the story got preachy about faith and religion. 3 stars. 
 ""Academy Field Trip"" by Donald Harstad: I'd be interested in reading a full-fledged sci-fic/urban by this author at some point, but I have a feeling it would be too nitty-gritty for me. I felt the story was well-written with a good plot, but it was more like a beginning than a complete story. 3 stars. 
 ""Sympathy for the Bones"" by Majorie M. Liu: Good Lord, that was creepy. This was a perfectly written short story. Everything you need to know was there and I couldn't read it fast enough, despite my general loathing for scary-ass stories. What I admired the most about it was how different it read from Liu's Dirk and Steele or the Hunter Kiss series. I'd have no problem believing this was a different author entirely. 5 stars. 
 ""Low School"" by Rhys Bowen: *pokes story* I don't know. Didn't love it, didn't hate it. Wasn't poorly written, wasn't particularly unique. Just was. 3 stars. 
 ""Callie Meet Happy"" by Amber Benson: Like the narrator, Callie, I'm not entirely sure what just happened. I know of the Calliope Reaper-Jones books, but I've never read them and I have no idea if the other characters featured in this story are new or from something else. There's no character development since it appears Benson assumes you already know them. The plot was interesting, though, and it worked well in a short story format. 3 stars. 
 ""Iphigenia in Aulis"" by Mike Carey: I CANNOT HANDLE ZOMBIE CHILDREN. Despite my personal feelings, this gets 5 stars. 
 ""Golden Delicious"" by Faith Hunter: Like Amber Benson's story, this one features characters from Hunter's full length Skinwalker series. I have never read anything by Hunter before, but I think she was better at seeding info so the reader could figure things out from the context. I thought the writing was strong enough that I wouldn't be opposed to reading something else by Hunter, but I have a feeling I'm probably not the target audience for her books. 4 stars. 
 ""Magic Tests"" by Ilona Andrews: If you didn't see the spreecast hosted by Project Paranormal featuring Gordon & Ilona, Nalini Singh, and Katie MacAlister, you missed out. Seriously, go google it because the interactions between Gordon & Ilona were hysterical. I bring this up because after finishing ""Magic Tests,"" I was left with the desire for a young adult series featuring Julie. However, in the spreecast, they kept emphasizing, Gordon especially, that they focus on what they're contracted for, on what brings in money. So no YA series for me, *pouts*. 5 stars. (Edited to add: I re-read it a second time and caught the hints about Derek. Now I really want another Julie book) 
 ""An Introduction to Jewish Myth and Mysticism"" by Steve Hockensmith: This is one of those stories where there are no hidden meanings or themes to decipher. Everything is laid out quite clearly for you, but you can really only see it when you reach the ending. 3 stars. 
 ""VSI"" by Nancy Holder: This was excellent and I hope a new series might spring from this. At its core, the plot or concept is not that unique, but Holder's voice is distinctive enough to make it feel fresh. 4 stars. 
 ""The Bad Hour"" by Thomas E. Sneigoski: Apparently, this is based off of Sneigoski's Remy Chandler series. I've never read any books by him and if this story is anything to go by, I bet they're pretty good in a Harry Dresden/Jim Butcher sort of way. 4 stars. 
 ""Pirate Dave and the Captain's Ghost"" by Toni L. P. Kelner: Last one! This is a sequel to the story by Kelner pub'd in Death's Excellent Vacation. I believe I've read that anthology, but it came out I started using GoodReads full-time. In any case, I have no real memory of the previous story, which didn't really matter. The Big Bad was an appealing type of crazy, but aside from that, there wasn't anything too original happening. 3 stars. 
 Averaging everything together gives the book a total of 3.77 stars so I'm just going to rate it four stars. Overall, I enjoyed most of the stories, but Carey's is going to haunt me for a long, long time."

 Magic is an integral part of the Mortiz family, and it is considered an honor when a child is old enough to fully embrace their talents. Alex, on the other hand, has been dreading the day when she celebrates her Deathday and must completely accept the powers that she's been hiding. She wants no part of her magical legacy- to her mind being a bruja, or witch, brings nothing but pain and trouble. 
 When Alex attempts to deny her inheritance, her efforts backfire and her entire family suffers the consequences. With the guidance of a boy she doesn't fully trust, Alex will be forced to rely on the powers she never wanted in order to bring her family safely home. 
 Cordova has created a magical world with elements of Greek mythology, Mexican spiritual culture, and her own unique flare. Alex is a sympathetic character with growing pains that will resonate with most teens- even those of the non-magical variety. Cordova's portrayal of Alex's multi-layered connection with both her female friend Rishi and the secretive brujo boy Nova comes across as authentic and meaningful to the story and Alexa's character development. This is the first in a proposed series, and readers will eagerly await their next meeting with the Brooklyn Brujas. 
 This ARC was obtained at BEA16, in exchange for an honest review."
5,"Firstly I would like to thank NetGalley for kindly approving of my request to read and review, absolutely LOVED this book. 
 I have fallen in love with Ms Oomerbhoy's work and I'm patiently waiting for more to come. 
 ""The Last Of The Firedrakes"" is one of then books where when you've reached the end and it leaves you dangling like a carrot in the wind, you automatically get the urge to track down the sequel and delve into the next one! 
 Aurora hasn't had an easy life, her biological parents were killed when she was young and she was adopted, unfortunately this wasn't a happy ending either, with these ultimately meeting their demise, thus leaving the young girl to live with ""other"" family 
 But what happens when she finds out that the world she lives in isn't quite what she thought it was, thus being transported to a WHOLE new world through the tapestry where magic rules 
 What will happen when Aurora finds out that she is the rightful Heir of the Illiador throne? 
 ""I had to stop running. I had to turn and face my life head on."" Aurora Firedrake 
 The world that Oomerbhoy has created has this amazing sense of fantasy. A world that leaves readers wanting to visit. It was the perfection of light and dark. 
 I loved the way the magical system worked, the mythical creatures we got to meet too. Aurora behaved in ways that were believable, both for the age of a 16 year old as well as the situations she was put in 
 There is a great Quest they all go on and I really want to see where this is going to lead. Unfortunately some of Aurora's actions will cause more hurdles for her to cross in her quest in becoming Queen."
4,"Really sweet book; very original and charming. Enchanting to read, and hard not to like."
4,"4 to 4.5 stars. She did it again! 
 It wasn't easy to be in Naz's head for me. I was so used to Karissa's point of view, not this analytical mind. But once I fell into it, I really enjoyed the book. It has the right pace, not rushed but not too slow either and it's well written. 
 It has a kind of contemplative edge to it, because Naz is always looking, taking notes, analyzing everything, every move and everyone. Even in the action's heat, it was like looking through a screen. Not really in the rush of the moment but analyzing it with a clear head. See in a movie when the hero is going in slow motion to save the heroine/take the bullet/catch the bad guy? That's how I felt. 
 It was so different than Karissa's point of view. The author did a really great job and it was probably sometimes difficult to keep this perspective and truly ""be"" Naz. 
 We get to see Karissa through Naz's eyes and she is really beautiful to him. 
 The patience this man has for her is mesmerizing. How many boyfriends would wait patiently while their girlfriend tries every single clothe and takes ages to get ready? Who would go out immediately and buy the most expensive camera to please his woman? Who would wait and say nothing when she is burning meals repeatedly while clanking the pans and pots very loudly? 
 Naz didn't expect to fall in love with Karissa but he owns this love. He is very lucid about who he is: a monster. He seeks no excuses for his actions. But now, he wishes he could be other, better, for her. She does deserve better than a killer in her life but he is so in love with Karissa he never wants to let her go. 
 I must also confess the first 40% of the book I just wanted to grip Naz and Karissa, shake them and shout: ""Stop being so stubborn, you love each other so get over with!"". But that's the price to pay for two strong characters in a book. They were infuriating at times and it seemd like a frozen standoff. Luckily for my blood pressure, there was much more to come. There are other monsters outside to take Karissa out. And Naz walked a fine line to keep her safe and pursue his revenge. Even if it could cost him Karissa's love and trust."
5,"The answer is 42. But what is the question? 
 Douglas Adams' take on the Universe and everything in it is that, really, it's just a bit of a joke. There isn't a grand meaning, as decades of science looks to discover. It is, in fact, bumbling along like we are. 
 Take Earth's last resident, unknowingly hitchhiking off of earth in its final seconds. He is quintessentially British. He grumbles, he rationalises, he seeks tea. Or Marvin, the robot who is sick of all the uppity, positive computer systems surrounding him and is by all accounts depressed. Spend a moment with him and you'll feel a little sad too. 
 Ford ended up stranded on Earth for 15 years too long, Trillian discovers her pet mice are actually more intelligent and powerful beings than her, and Zaphod masterminded one of the greatest thefts of the age and he doesn't even know why. They just kind of bumble along, and that's why it's good. 
 It's funny, and instead of having a round of protagonists demanding a reason for their existence, they just kind of blindly go on with what they're doing, whatever that is, and whether or not they actually know why. 
 Can someone tell me why I didn't read this until now?"
4,"Stephanie Perkins is the master of contemporary writing. She knows exactly how to make people feel the warm-and-fuzzes. 
 I really enjoyed reading Lola's story. It didn't beat Anna and the French Kiss though!"
4,"Sequel to Cinder. I'm still interested in the story, and I like how the new fairy tale (of Little Red Riding Hood) combines with that of Cinder in the first book."
5,"Absolutely loved it! I felt nothing but Lauren Graham vibes in this book. Her fun personality radiated off the pages. If you love Lauren Graham, with her long-winded run-ons and her witty reparte, then you will love this book. I listened to the audio book when I wasn't able to read and it was just as amazing. The fact that Graham is the narrator just makes it all the better. Only she knows how to wade through her fun-loving mess. I really hope she keeps up with the writing because I may have always been a Gilmore Girls fan but I am totally a Lauren Graham, the author, fan."
3,"Quirky heroes drawn in a quirky way. This comic initially has Doom Patrol-like overtones, but I felt like it didn't have much depth. Sure, the writing is technically good, and there's a good focus on pulp weirdness. But, I never got to know two of the main characters, I never believed the villain's turn to villainy, and I was never surprised by the story."
4,"Big thanks to Orbit Books for the advance copy via NetGalley! 
 I. Love. Mira. Grant. Her Newsflesh series is hands-down one of my absolute favorite series of books of all times. 
 This is not Newsflesh. But it is still an excellent piece of work by an equally excellent author. I am constantly floored by how well she crafts her characters to be believable and flawed. Do I always like them? No. But I always believe that they could be real people, and not just the workings of a talented woman's mind. 
 I guess I shouldn't have said that this isn't Newsflesh because that isn't entirely true. There are shades of Newsflesh in Parasite in the form of the medical side of things. Once again, Mira Grant (who, for those of you who don't know, is the horror alias of Seanan McGuire) has done her research. I am no expert on parasitology, but not once did I read something and go ""Pfft, yeah right!"". It was all done and explained very well, if some of the science went over my head. 
 Parasite takes us through the twisting tunnels of truth, consequence and identity. And they all intertwine. The descriptions are gritty and don't skimp on the gory details, Grant pulls no punches when it comes to the twists and turns, and the whole book left me wanting more. Which is totally unfair because the first book isn't even officially published yet. 
 Prose-wise, Mira Grant has definitely progressed from some of her other works. One of my main beefs with her books was always product placement. In InCryptid it is Ace Bandages. In Newsflesh it is Skin So Soft. But there is not even a shade of that in Parasite and I was thrilled. One thing that kept pulling me out of the story was the use of guns. For some reason, even though the setting is near-future and not all lunar colony, the guns didn't fit for me. 
 If you like medical thrillers, this book is very much for you. If you like Mira Grant or Seanan McGuire you will not be disappointed. 
 I strongly recommend you check out Parasite by Mira Grant from Orbit Books when it is published in October, 2013!"
5,"HOLY CRAP!!! I CAN'T BELIEVE THE END IS FINALLY HERE! AND I'M OKAY WITH IT BECAUSE I LOVED IT!!! 
 Okay, this isn't going to be too long because I want to avoid spoilers. 
 Character development was amazing. I feel like we got to see so many characters fleshed out and I grew to love them even more! Lucien, Elain, Mor, Amren, NESTA, Cassian, Azriel. Development for all of them! Even Feyre, Rhys, and Tamlin got some great development. Hell, even side characters that we barely knew got fleshed out in a way that I want to know more and I honestly can't WAIT for the side stories that Sarah writes! Every character she introduces I fall in love with and want to know more. 
 We got to see so many more of the courts and their high lords and I loved every second of it! I really liked getting to know them, and it was definitely fun whenever they got together. Very interesting indeed. 
 The ending was absolutely perfect!!! I cried, I laughed, I smiled. I loved it all. There was one thing that I thought was kind of ridiculous, (view spoiler)[ aka Amren (hide spoiler)] coming back, but I didn't even care because it made me happy lol! 
 I will say this, this book was definitely mature. Smut wise, but also violence and topic wise. 
 Overall it was amazing, a perfect ending to this series, and I CAN'T WAIT for the spinoff books!!!"
4,"Three years after losing her husband Adam to cancer, Detective Lottie Parker is still trying to come to terms with her grief and juggle her all-consuming job in the police force with the demands of bringing up three teenagers singlehandedly. Murders are not a common occurrence in the small Irish town of Ragmullin, so when two people are killed in short succession it rocks the community to the core. With her team of detectives, Lottie is at a loss to connect the two deaths, until her enquiries lead her to the gates of St Angela's, a deserted old mansion that used to serve as a home for wayward teenagers and the unwanted children of unmarried mothers until the 1970's. The mere look at the old building sends shivers through Lottie, as she is reminded of her own personal connection to the place. As her enquiries lead her further and further into the dark history of the home and the secrets buried deep in Ragmullin's past, she realises that she is dealing with some powerful people who will not stop at murder to keep the truth hidden. And soon the body count mounts ... 
 Giving Lottie Parker's richly drawn history, I was surprised to read that The Missing Ones was Patricia Gibney's debut novel! With her opening sentences, she instantly mastered that most difficult of all arts - to draw me into the story immediately, and keep me deeply rooted there. The Missing Ones is a very dark book, with sinister themes that haunted me in my sleep, even more so since we know that the abuse described has its origins in true historical facts. I was somewhat shocked and surprised at the timeline of the story, which had its origins in the 1970's, a time when I had assumed that there would have been more awareness and compassion preventing the hideous acts depicted. Terrifying! Linking the past with greed, corruption and depravity in the present time, the novel skips back and forth through history, exposing the true - and horrific - extent of the crimes Lottie is investigating. 
 Whilst I haven't quite yet welcomed Lottie into the fold of my personal favourite fictional female detectives, such as Maeve Kerrigan (Jane CaseyJane Casey), Lacey Flint (Sharon Bolton), Fiona Griffiths (Harry Bingham)and Erika Foster (Robert Bryndza), she certainly has the potential to be included on that list. Most women trying to juggle a demanding career with family will be able to relate to her struggles, and the guilt she feels on a daily basis as she is constantly torn between the two areas of her life. And as much as she is trying to keep work separate from family, the more impossible it becomes, until she finds that the nature of her work has put one of her own in danger. There are also the tentative hints at office politics involving Lottie and her colleagues, which I am hoping will further play out in future books and make this a very addictive series with many characters we will want to revisit. 
 Although this was a dark and disturbing read, I enjoyed the slow methodical unravelling of the clues leading to the story's chilling finale. At times, the sheer amount of different characters was a bit overwhelming, and the book was perhaps just a tad too long, but these are minor quibbles. I loved the cold, damp and grey Irish winter setting, which was beautifully evoked on every page, and added its own chilling atmosphere to the story. 
 Gibney definitely is a writer to watch and an exciting new voice in crime fiction. I look forward to seeing Lottie Parker featuring in many more novels to come. 
 Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for providing me with a free electronic copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review.

3,"Vonnegut's Player Piano takes place in an entirely believable future almost entirely run by machines. The main character's unwilling slide into rebellion is like watching a train wreck, leading to a conclusion that everyone should see coming, but will want to watch anyways."
3,"3.5 stars. More self-help than I thought, and less science, but there is some discussion of recent research and information on sexuality that is grounded in science. The author is a sex educator and professor at Smith College, and the tone of the book reflect this. I could picture it as a lecture at times, and it's written in a conversational tone. 
 There's a lot of good discussion on the mythology and false science surrounding sexuality and sexual functioning and how certain ideas have persisted through culture, creating false expectations and problems for women (and men) for decades. 
 The big takeaways are that everyone is normal, no matter what particular concerns or issues you have, and that working with your partner is important to accepting these differences and learning how to make your relationship work. This is easier said than done, of course, but for people willing to read this and think about things differently, this is a good starting point. The author makes a great point that someone could pick and choose the relevant parts of this book to incorporate in their life."
5,"Guys, I don't say this often but- you need to read this book. Seriously. I can't stop smiling."
5,"Gosh, I loved this book. I mean, I knew I would, because I adore Megan Miranda. And I have loved all the books I have read by her, which is all of them but one, lol. Must read that one soon too. I just. Megan writes such amazing stories. And she makes up such amazing characters. I couldn't not love this precious book. 
 I have been wanting to read this book for ages now, but had to wait until my hardcover arrived. Hmph. And then I could not read it fast enough. When I started it today, I had planned on reading a little today, the rest tomorrow. But lol. That didn't work out well. Once I started it, I could not stop. It was too exciting. And evil. 
 Everything about this book was awesome. The writing is good, and the characters were all written so well. I adored them all. Well, sort of. But yeah. This story was so amazing to read and I loved every moment of it. I do wish the book had been a little bit longer at the end, but I don't mind too much, because I found the ending to be pretty amazing. This book is full of suspense. I was sweating and so nervous. I loved it. So much. I was worried for just about the whole book, lol. And I enjoyed every moment of it. I loved that this book made me feel so many things. This plot was so special to me. I loved that Kelsey's mom hadn't left their secure house in seventeen years. I loved that there were secret reasons for it, and it was so exciting to figure it all out. 
 I really loved how this book began. Okay, I didn't like the school parts in the first few pages, lol, but I loved getting to know Kelsey a little. And to know that she was crushing on the boy in her class, Ryan. It was so cute. But then the accident happen. She crashes her car. Goes over a cliff. And Ryan is the person who saves her. Or she saves him. Or both. Either way, it was so exciting to read about. And yet so awful too, because I was so worried, and it was written so well. So much fear in this book. Gosh. Loved it to pieces. 
 There is so much exciting happening in this book. I'm not sure where to begin to describe it all. And I don't think I will have enough words for it either. Because I really liked this book. And I'm not sure what else to say about it. Hmph. But I'm trying. Because this book was long enough, and so exciting, and gosh. I need you all to read it. I'm so glad I read it right now. It was just what I needed. Though it might have made me a bit afraid too, living in my unsafe house. How mean. Mostly I just loved this book so much. 
 It is all told from Kelsey's point of view. And oh, getting to know this girl was so amazing. She has been living alone with her mom her whole life. Home schooled, until just recently. Only spending time with her mom and a handful of other people. So she is a bit innocent and doesn't know everything, yet she still knows more than enough, and I adored how cute she was. Around Ryan too. It was adorable. I just really loved getting to know Kelsey. She was strong and brave yet also afraid. This book was full of fear. Ack. 
 We also get to know so much about her mom. How she hasn't left the house once in all those years. How she was kidnapped when she was younger, escaping a year later, pregnant with Kelsey. Gosh. It was all so interesting and a bit heartbreaking and I couldn't help but love every moment of it. I loved reading about their house, their big gate and such. All their alarms. There is even a panic room. Ahhh. all the love. It was so exciting. And, you know, terrifying. I'm just so glad I loved this book so much. So happy. 
 And then the big plot begins. Kelsey arrives home late in the evening, with Ryan following behind her to talk to her, and she sees that the alarms are all turned off. And her mom is missing. And then she and Ryan are looking for her inside for ages, and gosh. Then their phones don't work. And the power gets turned off. And there are shadows outside. And shudders. There was so much happening. So much suspense. It killed me a little. I loved it oh so much. It was exciting and evil and so well written. Yesss. 
 There were a few awesome friends in this book. I liked Annika a whole bunch. I was a bit unsure about her a few times, but she ended up being pretty amazing and I loved reading about her. I didn't like Cole all that much, because of what he did years ago, but he was pretty sweet too. His sister was not. Ugh. I did not like her one bit. Sigh. And their mom, Jan. Sigh. I can't help it. I felt like she should have gotten fired, because of something she wrote. So I didn't like her all that much either. But I liked her sometimes. 
 There is so much in this book. I haven't mentioned all of it, not even close. There are bad people. There are exciting and terrible moments. I loved all of them. Nothing too brutal at all, yet so exciting. There is a really cute romance. I adored Ryan and Kelsey. The Safest Lies was such an incredible book. I loved every moment of it. It is full of suspense and action. I couldn't have asked for more. Sigh. I just wish there was another book after it, lol. I want more. I want a sequel. I can't wait to read more books by Megan :)

1,"I think I am still a little racist agains Afganistan & the middle east... I was just absolutely uninterested in these characters. I also think that, had the characters been of different nationality, I might have given it a much better try... is that wrong? Oh, I don't care if its wrong or not, it is what I felt as an American during wartime."
4,"Good little Stephen king stories. Really enjoyed them. Without spoiling anything, I really liked the revenge theme in these stories."
5,"I long deliberated about whether to review this or not. Sometimes you read something that resonates with you to such a degree, with such intensity that it feels as though you could never do it justice by reviewing it. That it just may be impossible to articulate the reasons why you loved this book and why other people should definitely try it out. But since I like doing impossible things, I am going to try. Just be warned though: No matter how lavishly I praise this book, it deserves a lot more. 
 It is a novel's prose that attracts me. The plot and the characterization, while important in their own rights, become secondary when I decide how much I like a novel. To date, there have been only two other novels that I have loved simply for the gorgeousness of their prose. They are The History of Love by Nicole Krauss and The Ghosts of Ashbury High by Jaclyn Moriarty. Chime finds itself a niche on my shelf of awesome. 
 Chime creates an unearthly world, a land dominated by marshes and superstitious people. The effect is surreal as though the reader has submerged herself in a world that is determined to surprise her by its strangeness and enthrall her with its beauty. The protagonist, Briony, is by far one of the strangest, and all the more compelling for it, narrator I have had the fortune to come across. She is an unreliable narrator and her narration is less of a storytelling and more as though the readers were the blank pages of her journal on which she is scribbling her experiences, thoughts and emotions. She is intricately detailed and her individuality is delineated even despite the fact that she has a twin sister. 
 ""I felt as though I were a music box in want of winding. Yes, as though I were a music box and the tune were my life, playing more and more slowly with every passing day. Finally, not even I could recognize it. The notes were stretched too far apart. They were no longer notes, they were plinks. I wound down to a plink."" 
 All the characters in the novel, no matter what their importance to the greater plot, are etched out and given worth. From the little boy that Briony considers a friend to the unfortunate man murdered in the marsh, they are all superbly characterized. 
 The plot comes to life slowly. The story does not flow from point A to B, oh no, it blooms like flowers in a field. First you may notice a patch of daisies on one side and then later on dandelions in the center. And then at the end, suddenly, you have a field full of flowers and it is much like an epiphany you weren't certain you were going to have. It's a beautiful thing. 
 This book contains one of the most delicious kissing scenes ever. I adore the love interest. I can't say much more than that. Honestly. Read it for the kiss scene alone. 
 And finally, let me talk about the prose. Billingsley plays unabashedly with language here. She creates words, she repeats them and it is a testament to her boldness that her experimenting pays off. 
 ""If you say a word, it leaps out and becomes the truth. I love you. I believe it. I believe I am loveable. How can something as fragile as a word build a whole world?""| 
 ""Eldric turned away from the mirror, holding out his hand. In the cup of his hand lay his fidget of paper clips. But the fidget had blossomed into a crown. An allover-filigree crown, with a twisty spire marking the front. 
 I stared at it for some moments. ""It's for you,"" said Eldric. ""If you want it."" 
 ""I'm seventeen,"" I said. ""I haven't played at princess for years."" 
 ""Does that matter ?"" Eldric set it on my head. It was almost weightless, a true crown for the steam age. 
 In a proper story, antagonistic sparks would fly between Eldric and me, sparks that would sweeten the inevitable kiss on page 324. But life doesn't work that way. I didn't hate Eldric, which, for me, is about as good as things get."" | 
 ""Father's silence is not merely the absence of sound. It's a creature with a life of its own. It chokes you. It pinches you small as a grain of rice. It twists in your gut like a worm. 
 Silence clawed at my throat. It left a taste of burnt matches."" 
 These are just of the delectable gems in this novel. So, if I haven't convinced you let, let those words do the job. Give it a chance. Even if you don't go in for eccentric protagonists, read this book. I guarantee you won't regret it."
3,Honestly this is one of my favorites of the Twilight/New Moon outtakes/short stories. It's cute and funny and answers one of your what ifs.
3,"It all started when Nora got the email, inviting her to a ""hen"" party for her former best friend Claire, whom she hasn't spoken to in 10 years. Reluctantly she accepts the invite, setting off a chain of events that she will struggle to recall when she wakes up in the hospital days later. 
 In a Dark, Dark Wood is most notable for its creepy and unsettling atmosphere. Set in glass house out in the middle of the woods, the reader immediately gets the feeling of being exposed and watched by malicious, unseen forces. The few guests that show up for the party form an unlikely group, making for many awkward and uncomfortable moments in what should have been a fun and relaxing weekend, celebrating Claire's last days as a single woman. 
 Throughout the narrative, Nora alludes to a deep, dark secret that she has closely guarded for the last 10 years. Without giving anything away, the secret itself was not as explosive as I'd expected, based on the build-up throughout the story. The characters also were not very well-developed, and I didn't feel much in the way of empathy for Nora or any of the others. The driving force in this story was the elusive mystery that slowly unfolds as Nora gradually remembers the events of the weekend leading up to the tragic accident. On the whole, I enjoyed the fast pace and the anticipation of discovering the mystery, despite the lackluster ending. It had a lot of potential, but the lack of character-development and originality made this book less outstanding than I had hoped."
4,"I'm really torn when it comes to Allegiant as half of me really liked this book and it's outturn and the other half didn't. It's the great final of the Divergent series that (if you haven't been spoiled) will surprise you rather a lot. 
 The pace of Allegiant improved a lot compared to Insurgent as it got ride of the running around without much purpose (which we were confronted with in Insurgent). It still felt a bit slow at some points and at the end I found myself wondering why I got certain information as they weren't relevant for anything at all (and I didn't care enough about certain characters anymore to be interested in their future). Overall Insurgent and Allegiant both suffered from unnecessary stuff that was just placed in it to prolong the book and it's story. At least that's what I thought about it. The story itself was mostly interesting, but never gave me as much of a thrill as other stories did. Revelations seemed kind of weird and left me with a bitter taste. Especially when I finally understood what divergent truly were. I always was really impressed with the concept, but hearing what it actually was all about left me very unimpressed. All I could think was ""Really? That's all there is to it?"". It just seemed so... silly. Some story turns also ended with me just sitting there, staring at the book and thinking ""You have to be kidding me! Really?!"". Especially at the end as certain things just seemed so stupid (for the lack of a better word). How could someone survive so much and die from a bullet. I'm still really upset about it as it just feels so stupid for someone to survive the deadliest stuff and then get killed so normally. Sometimes it felt like watching a TV show as characters seemed to get killed just because all that possibly could have happened to them has happened. Or they died to further improve another character or mess with their emotions. This upset me the most if I'm honest. 
 I got confused in the beginning as this time we're met with two storytellers. I can see why Roth told the story from both Tris' and Tobias' view, but in the beginning I didn't see much difference between them so I got really confused as I didn't always read who was the storyteller at the moment (yes, I admit it. I skip chapter titles unintentionally). Once again we are met with new characters which bring a nice mix to the characters we already knew. What I really enjoyed was some of the relationship aspects which influenced this book a lot. There were others which annoyed me a bit though as I didn't saw why certain characters were still included in the book when they didn't do much to improve it's story in the end. It just felt pointless. I also got upset when cool characters started to be killed and those more or less ""useless"" characters survived until the end. 
 A thing I liked was Tris' improvement as she really grew on me. She grew up so much during the three books as she started as this teenage girl who was a bit annoying (okay, she annoyed me a lot) and ended up as a grown up in the end. That's something I really liked about the book. 
 A huge plus in my opinion were the last few chapters/pages as they had so much emotions included that it nearly ripped my heart in pieces. I didn't expect to find something like this at the end which honestly surprised me and influenced my opinion of the book greatly. I enjoyed the Divergent series more than I expected to enjoy it after reading the first book. Overall it was a nice series that unfortunately left me with the same feelings I had for The Maze Runner series. I liked it - and I kind of want to love it - but I simply can't as there is too much which bothers me in the end. I still would recommend it as it's an interesting world you enter if you decide to read the Divergent series."
3,"The twin-telepathy premise felt a bit odd to me, but the story overall was solid enough."
3,"note to self: the russian mafia head associated with the main bad guy here, shows up in Dangerous Secrets 
 i'd read this a long time ago. didn't mean to go rereading, since i don't really like the h. but it made for a fun skim. (still not rating it above 3 though)"
5,"I love YA book like this. Books that are soo much more than just a love story, it so so much more. Lucas is one hell of a guy. Physically, he may seem like the typical badboy but he's wayyy deeper. It is his character that I love in this book."
2,"Didn't like this very much. It was a fun story but not given the detail I would have appreciated. Then again, it covers a few years in a girl's life in not too many pages, so I guess it had to skim a bit. Also, might be the children/young adult aspect that doesn't allow to go as in-depth as I would have liked. 
 Might read the further adventures, but my library's missing #2 and I don't feel motivated enough to ILL it. 
 Story of a girl who wants to be a knight, not a nun or a wife, so she switches place with her twin brother so he can go learn to be a wizard and she can train to be a knight. Things are tough, but she finds friends and inner-strength to get her through her trials. The story so far ends with her going t become squire to her friend, the Prince."
2,"This wasn't bad, it just wasn't as much or as good as I had expected, given the reviews I read. Granted, I didn't even realize it was a novella until I was part way through listening to the audio. This story just didn't do much for me...felt like it never really got started, and then quickly wrapped up."
2,Bummed I didn't enjoy this more - literally the only character I liked was Darcy.
5,"I absolutely loved and hated this book. At first I thought Olivia was a selfish, conniving and manipulative liar without a heart and Caleb was the saint who loved her despite her flaws but of course it wasn't that simple. They both had secrets and their love was so strong it always endured whatever obstacles came their way. I must say I hate the ending and the last couple of chapters had me in tears. Can't wait for the squeal."
5,"Welcome back to the world of parasols, dirigibles, clavigers, and drones. Alexia Tarabotti is back, in all her sharp-tongued glory -- only now she's Lady Maccon, wife of the Alpha of the Woolsey pack, and muhjah to Queen Victoria. Clearly, none of this makes sense if you haven't read Soulless, book one in the adorable Parasol Protectorate series. Alexia continues making her mark on Victorian society, but now with social clout. Firmly ensconced in Woolsey Castle, Alexia is madly in love with her large, loud werewolf husband, despite considering him the most frustrating man in the world. Not to worry, the feeling is mutual. In Changeless, the supernaturals of London are afflicted by a ""plague of humanization"", and it's up to Alexia to determine the true cause. Along the way, she deals with ugly hats, high-tech parasols, a cross-dressing female inventor, and someone -- or possibly several someones -- who would like to see her dead. All this, plus a dirigible ride! I've come to truly adore these books, and find myself somewhat obsessed with Alexia and Connall's stormy relationship. Ms. Carriger's first book, Soulless, had an exhilaratingly happy ending. The end of Changeless was something completely different, and I'm quite devasted by the fact I have to wait until the release of the third book in September to find out what happens next. Highly recommended."

5,"One of my favorites of the series, which is saying alot because I LOVE all of them. Being a single mom I can relate to Ginger the most of all the McKay women, she's strong and somewhat a control freak. I actually learned alot about myself reading this story. 
 NOTE: This book actually takes place between Book # 7 Shoulda Been A Cowboy and Book # 8 All Jacked Up. I would read Raising Kane before All Jacked Up, ater All Jacked Up, read Slow Ride (Free short story about Keely's wedding reception) then Cowgirls Dont' Cry. It really doesn't mess up the stories, but I am just anal about reading in chronological order =)"
3,"3 1/2 - great writing, sweet love story, no real surprises but I enjoyed spending time in the ballet world with these characters."
5,"What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said? If you love mysteries, this is the cream of the proverbial crop. Delightful, intoxicating, bloodcurdling whodunit fun."
4,"In what would be one of the most anticipated and talked about upcoming books for 2012, the hype for this installment certainly delivered in spades. Given the end of City of Fallen Angels and that all so dreaded cliffhanger which Cassie left us on, it's easily understandable how you'd want to know what was going to happen next and how would Jace separate himself from Sebastian whose lifeforce has joined with his. Not an easy prediciment if you ask me. 
 There had been comments about City of Fallen Angels and how it wasn't up to par to what the series usually was in the first 3 books, and I have to agree. Some parts of the book weren't that interesting. But it wasn't like it was the worst book either. Sometimes not every book has to be perfect. It had its flaws and that's normal. 
 But come this installment and I felt things were back on track. I was glued to every single page like there was no tomorrow. There was exciting and thrilling events that I had to know what was going on, and what would happen next. 
 What I found was interesting was we got multiple POV's, but it was refreshing and nice to see. We got to see more of the relationship between Alec and Magnus. Got to understand how it wasn't all roses and flowers. They do have problems just like any other couple, and there was tears shed, that is for certain. 
 We also go to see the progressing relationships between Kyle/Maia, and Simon/Isabelle. And I think I need to make it clear right here. I don't know what part it happened, but somewhere during the course of this book Simon & Isabelle became my OTP for this series. 
 Don't get me wrong. I still love Jace and Clary, and even Alec and Magnus to death, but my God... Simon and Isabelle -- I don't know what it was about those two in this book, but there is no doubt that whatever it was pulled me in line and sinker. 
 There was quite a bit of character development and relationship building probably more so than in any other book, which was great to see. 
 People made mistakes. There was tears, heartbreak and reunions. I'd say it was almost perfect. 
 Sebastian... Ah, what can I say about him? I almost started to like him in the early stages of the book, but then his real motives were revealed and he did... things, and I was back to being disgusted with him for the remainder of it. 
 I just had hoped there was a small amount of good in him even just for the fact he was still the son of Jocelyn. But no, I was fooled. I had hoped that he could changed. 
 This was a fantastic way to bring the series back. I even had developed some theories based on appearances by Brother Zachariah. About who he is... you tell me your theories and I'll tell you mind. Maybe we might match up and have the same thoughts on this topic. 
 And I got to admit, I couldn't help but almost die during a particular scene that happened that involved a TID/Will & Tessa thing in this book where it involved two core TMI characters. You will understand what I mean -- I hope? 
 Cassandra Clare did an amazing job working on this novel. I am constantly amazed at the amount of research and world building she puts into this series, and also TID. It's the kind of thing that keeps you addicted book after book. Page after all. It's the kind of work I aspire to. 
 I applaud you, Cassie. 
 To end this review off, I am not happy that we have to now wait TWO YEARS for the final installment. Yes, we might get Clockwork Princess early next year, but then it's ANOTHER year for the final The Mortal Instruments installment. But I suppose, being the final books of each series that they take extra time and effort to making sure everything gets tied up in the end and to make sure it's the best work you could do for your characters and story. 
 Rating: 5/5"
4,"I have to admit - Debra Driza had me hooked at the very first sentence. I love the way she wrote about Mila - an android thrown into the regular world with human emotions and completely unaware of what she was - and how Mila reacted to her newfound knowledge and abilities. It was really exciting reading from the perspective of Mila as we could see how emotionally broken but, at the same time, determined she was and how her android abilities reacted to each situation she was thrown into. What made it even more interesting was all the twists that I didn't see coming. Beautifully written -- I highly recommend it."

3,"{Notes} 
 *A high 3.5, rather than just a 3. 
 *I'm really, really torn about this book. I made the mistake of seeing the movie first, which I found comically adorable. Normally seeing the movie first never really has an impact on my reading experience, but this is one of those cases where I just might possibly like the movie adaptation more. 
 *But why? Because the movie had a clear definition of what it wanted to be. Quirky and charming, with just a dash of terror. The book? All over the place! Is it romance? Is it a zombie book? Is it a brilliant mash-up? Close, but no cigar. 
 *Addressing the romance aspect, I never really felt the connection to R and Julie. Zombie eats your boyfriend, instantly forgive said zombie without any apparent moral struggle? I just don't quite buy it. Pretty much all of R's experiences are through eating Perry's (the ex-boyfriend) brain. He seems to fall in love with her through Perry's eyes, and not through his own. Why is she so lovable? What makes their love so phenomenal that it starts to cure the world of the zombie plague? The relationship should have been more complicated and taken longer to form - make them fight for it! I'm not a fan of instalove. And, honestly, Julie is boring. 
 *As for the zombie aspects, it could have been better. Props for a totally unique premise, however. On the outside, zombies are just shuffling meatbags who occasionally go out and munch on people. On the inside, they've developed a basic society. There are high ranking zombies who herd and control the rest. There is a church. There are marriages. There's a school for zombie children. Things go on in their heads, and they can actually mumble broken sentences to each other. It's totally different from the typical portrayal of a zombie, and I appreciate that. 
 *What this book really needed was some more meat - and not the human kind (haha!). I want to know where the zombie virus came from, how the Boneys came to be, how they formed their society. I wanted to watch R go from a complete monster to being redeemed in the end - his path to forgiveness is ridiculously simple. I wanted epic romance. All that could have been achieved with more detail and more plot. This is a brilliant idea that really just needed to be fleshed out. 
 *Kudos for the Romeo and Juliet retelling in a zombie apocalypse. That, I did like. 
 *Some of the prose is absolutely gorgeous. I loved reading some of the passages from inside R's head. However, the style leaked all over other characters. While it makes sense for the inside of R's brain to think this way, it didn't seem realistic for Julie to start making incredibly verbose speeches. Everyone started to sound the same at a certain point. 
 *Redwall reference. Oh yes, book. You earned a star just for that. <3 
 *The anatomical drawings at the beginning of each chapter were just gorgeous. 
 *The ending felt rushed to me. I can't pinpoint it, really, but when I turned the last page, I just had a kind of 'wtf' feeling. 
 *Overall, it's an incredibly unique zombie tale. Some will like it more than others - it's just one of those kinds of books. The prose is stunning in sections, purple in others. Personally, I feel it was a brilliant idea that just needs a little more work. I did thoroughly enjoy the movie with almost no complaints, but they're almost two different stories. 
 *P.S. Don't let that Stephenie Meyer blurb scare you off... ;D 
 *I did like the beginning of the book way more than the second half. There was a sense of dry humor in the beginning that failed to make it all the way through. I've read that this is supposed to be a ""comedy"", but I just don't necessarily see it. I feel the film adaptation captured ""comedy"" to a much better extent. The book was, honestly, a little morose at times."
5,"More reviews available at my blog, Beauty and the Bookworm. 
 The Water Knife is basically a story of the people of the American southwest and what happens to them when water starts drying up, droughts begin taking over, and the scramble liquid becomes all-encompassing. The ""water knife"" of the title is not an actual knife, but the main character, Angel. He is a water knife in the sense that he ""cuts"" water; that is, he works for a woman named Catherine Case, known as the Queen of the Colorado River, who enforces the water rights of Las Vegas vehemently. Angel is one of her posse who goes out and takes down anyone who's trying to siphon Case's water away, cutting off the flow by any means necessary and leaving people and places to die in his wake. He is very, very good at what he does, which makes him the perfect candidate for a mission Case wants completed: find out what's happening with a rumored score in Arizona, and if there are water rights up for grabs, grab them. 
 Our other two main characters are Lucy and Maria, who live in Phoenix--Angel's destination. Phoenix is slowly being devoured by the desert, dust storms coming more frequently and lasting longer, the water only for the very wealthy; those who aren't wealthy are basically living off the mercy of the Red Cross. Everyone with sense and ability is getting out, but getting out is hard because the other states have closed their borders to refugees from the waterless states. Maria is originally from Texas, which has been completely destroyed by natural disasters, and she wants to leave Arizona, too, but can't afford a ""coyote"" to smuggle her across the border into another state. She and her friend Sarah are basically doing all they can just to stay afloat--Sarah by working as a prostitute, Maria by selling water from Red Cross pumps at hiked-up prices at a construction site. Lucy, on the other hand, can leave whenever she wants; she's not from Arizon, but has moved there to further her career as a journalist and document Phoenix's descent, which she does quite faithfully via the hashtag #PhoneixDownTheTubes. But Lucy gets more than she bargained for when one of her friends, who'd spent recent days talking about a big score and a way to California, turns up dead. Furious, Lucy aims her pen at everyone she's resisted targeting for so long, completely disregarding her own safety in a city that has basically become a dog-eat-dog world. 
 As Angel searches for water rights and Lucy searches for the truth, their paths and that of Maria begin to weave in and out of each other. It's an extremely dangerous place, Bacigalupi's Phoenix, People get shown, blown up, fed to hyenas, and all sorts of other unpleasant things. This is a very violent book; I'd really say it's not for the faint-of-heart. There is also an ""attraction"" plotline, which I hesitate to call a real romance because the characters like each other, are intrigued by each other, and are definitely attracted to each other, but they're still also perfectly willing to stab each other in the back if necessary, and neither of them is really sure what their involvement is. ""Romance"" typically implies some sort of resolution, which this didn't have and I don't think will have, given that, to my knowledge, there's not going to a Water Knife #2. 
 The path of this book is twisty and turning, with things spiraling in around each other but everything still interlocking quite well. I didn't see any gaping plotholes; Bacigalupi's world seems very tight. This is, however, a book that lacks a lot of resolution. There's no world-saving going on here, so if you're the type of person who likes to leave a book with everything wrapped up in a neat little package, this is not for you. It's definitely a ""it's the journey, not the destination"" that counts type of book. In the end, the world (or at least the American southwest) is still pretty much screwed, but I'd come to care about the characters and have hope for their individual futures more than I did for the world at large. It was a type of ending that, yes, would suck if it were reality (which it very well could become; that is the scary part about books like this) but I think fit the narrative perfectly. It also read, to me, as basically a prequel to Dust by Hugh Howey. Put together, I think the two are a really good sci-fi story about what might happen when we start running out of water. It is not, however, a book that goes along with the misleadingly-titled (but lovely) What the World Will Look Like When All the Water Leaves Us. 
 An excellent book, but a violent one and one that is scary in its foreboding of a likely reality. Sensitive readers be warned! 
 4.5 stars out of 5."
5,"Another great book in this wonderful series. 
 The first half of it I was laughing so loud my baby got scared and started to cry. 
 (Kelly) They made him drop his pants. He got whistled at. 
 By you! Nick shouted. 
 ""I'm going to die in Scotland"", Nick said under his breath. ""In a kilt"". 
 The second half got me worried and sad,then worried again and then happy though still worried. 
 It just made me feel so many things... I loved it. 
 I adore Ty and Zane and I don't know how I'll manage to wait for the next one :( 
 ""She's a year old. She won't understand death and destruction for at least another year."" 
 ""If we ever decide to adopt, you're a mute in any interviews."" 
 ""Understood."""
1,"This book has two problems, one major, one minor. The major is why I abandoned it about halfway through. 
 The biggest problem at the halfway point is that all the conflict is predicated on one of the two main characters being either stupid or weak. Or both. Neither trait is attractive or engaging to me. So while I enjoyed Merry well-enough, it's kind of hard to sympathize with her being so very clueless. Trent is a complete no-show. His kowtowing to his brother is obscene and his treatment of Merry is stupid. 
 Speaking of the brother, that's the minor problem. The man is a pile of puke and since we start off with Merry in love with the waste of skin, we see him a lot. Worse, as Trent's twin, we see him in both perspectives and since he's such a nasty, arrogant slime it means we have a double dose of the worst contrivance of the story (that both main characters tolerate the jerk). 
 So yeah, this is a dead loss and I regret the purchase. Fortunately, Audible has a generous return policy, so all I'm out is the time. Wish I had a refund on that, too..."
4,"Adorable 
 Poison by Bridget Zinn was published by Disney Hyperion, and you know what you can tell. The story is about Kyra, a potion master, who is on the run after trying to kill the Princess, her friend. Kyra is a young woman who loves to work with potions, spend time with Ariana her friend and the Princess and someone who is ridiculously independent. When the book opens we find the MC to be on the run, trying to find a particular potion, which will kill the princess and accomplish the boshed up assassination attempt 3 months ago. During her running she encounters Fred, a stranger to her land, the only person that Kyra has interacted with since the assassination attempt. Kyra, along with a pig, a wolf dog and Fred must figure out what is wrong with Princess Ariana and also how to stop her from getting married and becoming one with the land, a ceremony that Kyra has envisioned will destroy their world. The thing is that Krya has no proof, but her visions, her visions she reasons because she is a witch, a secret she has hidden all her life. 
 This book is intriguing because you do not have all the pieces of the puzzles. As you read, slowly each piece is revealed to you. By the end of the book things you thought were truths are revealed and connections between characters are exposed. It is a lighthearted book filled with fantasy and easy to follow and get into. I would recommend this book for those that like mystery and fantasy books, especially if they are looking for a light read. 
 Thanks Net Galley!"
5,I can't believe it's taken me this long to read Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Of course I've seen the movie(s) and adored the story as it is told on the screen but this novel is a classic for a reason and now I know why. I officially love this book!
4,"Once I got into this book, I enjoyed the plotline especially the tales the Lysander tells Alyssa about the ancient times of being with the coven. As a history fanatic this was fascinating. I'd truly love to see his book. 
 Alyssa is not immediately likeable as I found her a bit weak and selfish, but she grew into her own as the story progressed. Her goodness shines through even when she does a horrendous act. 
 Lysander is very intriguing and could not resist his charms. He is strong silent and protective. He needs Alyssa and it's apparent from the beginning. 
 The conflict between his old coven is touching in it's sadness. Lysander has so much history with them. 
 The only writerly issue I really had was words that were two syllables were often separated by a hyphenate when they shouldn't have been. I'm not sure if this is just an issue in the copy I got or if it made it's way into production that way."
4,"I loved the story, it was such an easy and enjoyable read. i found myself checking the time two days ago and realising that it was way past midnight. It was so hard to put it away. I don't know why. It may be the holiday spirit making me crave sweet stories about happy endings, love and family. 
 Now I'm going to wait, very impatiently, for the next instalments."
5,"I loved this book so much, it was a middle-grade novel but I think that people of any age can still find something to admire about it, whether it's the creative fantasy and magic in the story, the way the friendship between Rosie and Adam is written out or the way that you never know what's going to happen next. :)"
3,"A creepy tale told in alternating chapters of past and present, about a missing girl who may or may not have been taken by the King of the Faerie. Woven in with love, paranoia, mental illness and the power of story the ending is unsettling enough to cause me to doubt even my own perceptions while reading it."
4,I was genuinely surprised by how much I ended up liking this book. A full review to come.
5,"I feel happy when I discover a great author and even happier when the book is not a standalone. 
 The moment I read 
 ""Her eyes are wide open. Her lips parted as if to speak. Her dead body frozen in the ice...She is not the only one"" 
 I were instantly hoocked. 
 All the way while I am listening to this wonderful book, I was afraid that the ending will not be as good as the premise and the strong potential this book has. BUT the ending was very satisfying and you will not guess ( 
 not in a milion year! 
 ) what really happens. 
 This novel not a typical crime novel, it dealt with curruption, girls trafficing and imigration as well as the twisted rich families that have glamurus picure on social media and newspapers. 
 I highly recommand it and will definitly continue this series even though its not connected but the main character is DCI Erika Fosteer ( Detective Cheif Inspector ) whom I liked a lot in this book."
4,"It wasn't my highlight of the year, but still a very enjoyable book. The story was interesting and I really liked Avery as the main protagonist. She felt real to me and I liked how she was strong in a more quieter way. The book was also pretty humorous sometimes and I was very fond of the slow burning romance. It wasn't heavy at all which I always appreciate in books. 
 My only (little) problem was that I found the story to be a bit predictable. Certain betrayals and plotlines couldn't surprise me and I was even annoyed by the characters being so slow in discovering them. 
 I still want to read the rest of this series, but not right away. I definitely recommend this book for fantasy lovers who like a touch of royalty and political intrigue in their books."
5,"This may be my favorite read of 2017. I loved every page, every word. This book was just what I needed. It was refreshing and perfect. I am so glad I read this book!"
3,"I really loved the beginning of this book. The setting was beautiful and interesting. Both characters were well described and flushed out through actions and not just description. Their subsequent adventure, horror and crazy survival was amazing to read and it was hard to put the book down. 
 But about 80%...it lost me. it did a big "" Wait...WHAT??"" moment that I just couldn't buy off on. And it threw me enough that it knocked it down from the easy 4 star rating it would have had."
4,"After re-reading this, I understand things a little more clearly, and I'm hoping I can complete the series without getting bogged down in confusion over q-dots and qupting and quantum this and quantum that. Hannu loves him some quantum, is what I'm saying. 
 I should have at least put up a little review the first time I read this, last year, because now I'm curious whether I rated it a solid 4 or wanted a 4.5 and had to settle. That's the case now. It's a great book, lots of intrigue and plot and some action and so on. It's just so purposefully dense! I'd recommend reading it twice before reviewing...which I guess, technically, I did. Ok. 
 Quantum!!1"
5,"Oh, this book! It was so much bigger than I expected it to be. More intense, deeper, sexier and darker. Also, gorgeous. And tender. And just...wonderful. It was everything I love about a Megan Erickson book, kicked up a notch. 
 Riley and Colin fill a hole in each other's lives. They're both sitting at rock bottom, trying to find their way out the other side when a chance meeting at a gas station ends with a cross country road trip that allows the two to get to know each other. This process is handled with Ms. Erickson's trademark tenderness and humor. I repeatedly found my heart clenching with emotion at the same time a laugh burst forth. 
 ""Well, you're kind of a ninja."" 
 I barked out a laugh. ""A ninja?"" 
 He grinned at me. ""Yeah, you kinda have this Aw shucks, I'm just an ol' Southern boy thing going on. All harmless and unassuming and easygoing. But you're persistent and thoughtful and so damn hot that before I knew it, I was attached to you."" 
 The relationship that they build is formed relatively slowly and, once it catches fire, it basically left scorch marks all over my Kindle. 
 These boys are H-O-T. 
 No, really. These boys made me lose my panties. And the irony that neither one of these boys is interested in my panties is not lost on me. I practically threw my panties at them anyway. Their physical chemistry is off the charts. 
 ""Riley liked it when I talked. He liked my mouth, he'd told me. Whether I was sucking him or telling him harder."" 
 *shiver* Dirty talkers are my ultimate favorite. 
 But, physical chemistry alone does not a relationship make. 
 Colin and Riley are broken - separately, and together. Ms. Erickson has described this story as a tribute to the 90s movie Mad Love and - that is a spot-on comparison. Her portrayal of co-dependence and mental illness is heartbreaking and breathtaking. Riley's issues were handled with such honesty and care - he's a broken person, but he's still irresistibly loveable. 
 Likewise, Colin has piles of his own baggage that he needs to sort through, but there's never been a more worthy hero. Ms. Erickson broke my heart, over and over again and then she pieced it back together and lit it up with rainbow pig lights - leaving it happy and overflowing with all the ooey gooey feels. 
 ""I love you, Catwalk. I love every part of you. All of you. And I'll be there every time you need to be picked up. You hear me?"" 
 Goddamn - these boys! My heart! They stole it! This story was so rich, and deeply layered. In parts sweet, sexy, heartbreaking, dark, funny, and swoony. In a word - it is everything. A stunning love story, and a new favorite. 
 P.S. Landry and Justin, also! I love them! I missed them! I was so happy to see them here! I can't stop fangirling! ~ Shelly, 5 stars 
 ~~~ 
 Oh, Megan Erickson, what are you doing to me? Aside from turning me into a hopeless fangirl, of course? After an awesome series of sexy, funny reads from Ms. Erickson, I opened Focus on Me with high expectations. It may not have been as funny and as light-hearted as some of her previous works, but it was just as sexy, and just as awesome. With this soulful, emotional book, she didn't just meet my expectations, she exceeded them. 
 This was probably the best and the worst book I could have picked up at the moment. With its deep subject and sharp ups and downs, my already hurting, overly hormonal heart felt like it was taking a bit of a beating. Or maybe that's just the damn fine quality of Ms. Erickson's writing. 
 Focus on Me was, simply put, spectacular. The characters were real, human, emotional and raw. I loved Colin; he was strong and focused, stubborn and persistent, but he was also a little naive and a little blind. He was real. I loved Riley, too. I sympathized and empathized with him. Together, they felt whole and right, complete, even when they were at their most broken. 
 Their chemistry was undeniable, and they absolutely burned up together, but there was so much more to this book. It touched on a subject matter that had a personal resonance for me, and it was handled both beautifully and sensitively. There was good (really fucking good) and there was bad (still really fucking good), there was even in-between. And through all of it, my heart and my head were both telling me I NEEDED to keep reading. 
 My eyes welled up and spilled over, my heart ruptured and broke. Ms. Erickson built me up by throwing in some hot moments, tender moments, and funny moments. Then she kind of shattered me, only to piece me back together with a hopeful ending and some awesome cameos from Trust the Focus' Justin and Landry. 
 Yep, expectations definitely met and exceeded. ~ Beth, 5 stars 
 ~~~ 
 This book. AHHH. THIS. BOOK!!! It is absolutely amazing! It gave me all the feelings. ALL. THE. FEELS!!! 
 Colin is a sweet southern boy with a ""caretaker"" gene. After failing out of college he makes the cross country trip from California to North Carolina. He didn't plan to have a travel buddy for the trip, but he can't say no to Riley when he finds him stranded in a gas station. A simple ride turns into so much more in this book. 
 ""I had a travel buddy. Who happened to star in my jerk-off fantasies, but that was information I didn't plan to disclose."" 
 Riley just wants to feel. He has a bucket list that he wants to complete that he thinks will help him. He didn't expect a friend to help him complete his bucket list. He certainly didn't expect to be attracted to his ride. When the two finally give in to their attraction - wowza! 
 ""Riley. On his knees. Shoving my pants down my thighs. Pressing his face along the length of my cock, his tongue licking one long swipe up the underside."" 
 This book had it ALL! It made me laugh; it made me swoon; it made me cry; and it made me feel. When a book can invoke that much emotion in me, it becomes an all-time favorite! 
 ""We were fucking enablers, and I doubted I was strong enough to quit Riley."" 
 I absolutely loved that we got to see Justin and Landry in this story as well. The emails were great, but the ending was even better! 
 While I feel like I can't even do this book justice with this review, I will tell you that you NEED to read this book NOW! It is by far Ms. Erickson's best work and I can't wait for more! ~ Tiffany, 5+ stars 
 ~~~ 
 I honestly don't know where to start with this review. This book. OH. MY. GOD, this book... Heartbreaking, beautiful, haunting... 
 Oh my heart. Colin and Riley. Sigh, I just loved them. Colin trying to overcome his ""failures"" and Riley just trying to make it through the day. Together they're magic. Colin is so much stronger than he gives himself credit for and Riley just needs someone to make him feel. And that someone is Colin. 
 There are so many issues that are touched upon in Focus On Me, but none of it feels false or glazed over. Nothing is prettied up--their emotions come through as real. I felt every bit of angst, sadness, happiness, love, lust... Add in Landry and Justin from Trust the Focus and this book was perfect. ~ Missy, 5 stars"
5,"** spoiler alert ** 
 LOCATION: 
 I forgot. Sheesh. Modern day setting. It's a real place, but the characters can go back and forth in time. 
 MAIN CHARACTERS: 
 Emerson. I love her. She's just so witty, and stubborn, and sarcastic. My kind of girl! I love her with all my heart! And then there's Michael, her love object. Michael is fiercely protective of Emerson. He would do abs 
 olutely anything for her. The thing is, he keeps hiding things from Emerson saying that he just wants to protect her. Much like Edward. I hate it. 
 WHAT THE BOOK IS ABOUT: 
 Time travel. Various gifted individuals. School for gifted individuals. One character is so similar to Professor X. The book is about acceptance of oneself and literally correcting past mistakes. 
 LOVE: 
 When the girl who is supposed to be their ""guide"" turned out to be the bad guy. One amazing twist. Like that in Across the Universe by Beth Revis. 
 NO LOVE: 
 When Michael died, or got stuck somewhere in time. Whatever. I was thinking, Emerson and Michael are meant to be together, so Michael should come out of it alive. But on second thought, there's Kaleb... hmmm... 
 FAVORITE CHARACTER: 
 Emerson. So snarky! I think I see myself in her. 
 FAVORITE LINE: 
 ""I am sorry."" Kaleb grinned at me. ""Sorry I didn't meet you first."" 
 MUSINGS: 
 Like the others would say, this book is about time travelling, correcting mistakes in the past. But the romance in this book, oh! the romance! Swoon. The tension between Michael and Emerson is amazing. I wanted to possess Emerson, and jump on Michael for her. I like these kinds of books, where you think you already have someone when you don't. So close, yet so far. Rubberband-ish. I couldn't stop reading. Once I stopped, I couldn't stop thinking about it.

4,"""Read"" by listening to podcast. I'm not sure if I am entertained by the book or Sigler's breathless narration, but I was entertained! Great cover!"
1,"This review was posted on my blog, SugarQuills. 
 I was sent Nevernight by the publisher for an honest review. 
 I had ginormous expectations of Nevernight because of Kristoff's description/review on Goodreads, the glorious cover, and the fact that it's a high fantasy book about assassins. Unfortunately, I couldn't get into it. 
 Nevernight is strange; it has footnotes. Sadly for me, this was a major pitfall. As great as the narrative voice was (it was funny), it was super distracting to keep flicking my eyes down at the footnotes to read the narrator's descriptions and general comments. Some footnotes were ridiculously long, so it felt like the author was trying to compensate for missing information by throwing it into the footnotes. 
 The story was bombarded with unnecessary and confusing metaphors that pulled the focus off what was going on and onto the writing style. It was kind of like the author was saying, ""Hey don't focus on the story, look at the fancy descriptions I'm using instead."" The entire point of reading fantasy is to lose yourself in the author's constructed world (okay, that's arguably the point of all fiction), but how am I supposed to fall into the story if I keep thinking about the long-winded metaphors? 
 As a result of all of these 'quirks', I kept getting pulled out of the story; found myself getting lost a lot, and I kept forgetting what was going on because of how often I was losing track of what I was reading. And that's why I decided I couldn't carry on with this book. Maybe I'm just crap at remembering things (this is true ), or maybe it's just the book (it's the book). 
 Anyway, I read to page 148 before giving up, then I tried again and got to page 200 and decided it's definitely not for me. I might have enjoyed Nevernight more if I could stay glued to it as the plot itself was cool, but the writing style and footnotes were too awkward. I had a little chat about the footnotes with some bloggers and we were divided about how we felt. 
 So, the footnotes and general writing style might be the cherry on top for some readers, but they're not my thing."
5,I love reading books that offer up so many snippets of wisdom.
3,"twas ok :) 
 review to follow soon"
3,"Eastern Standard Tribe reads so quickly and flows so well that it feels like it must be light weight fluff -- a throw away entertainment and nothing more -- but it doesn't take much, only a little thought and a willingness to engage with ""dead bodies"" and ""living flesh,"" to see that it is much more. 
 Cory Doctorow is an unrepentant blogger, and it shows in this, his second novel. His language fizzes and crackles like three bags of Pop Rocks burning their carbonated pleasure on a tongue, popping out computer geek jargon in one line and imaginary pop culture in the next, before spinning off into a welcome tirade full of compelling arguments. 
 One minute Doctorow's revealing truly terrifying insights into the field of mental health, demonstrating how a pseudo-science bent on homogeneity can wield enough power to put people away without due process or any process at all. The next he's casually envisioning a mobile, futuristic Napster to rule the highway airwaves with piracy turned privateering. 
 It is sci-fi so successful in its plausibility that it almost ceases to be sci-fi. In Doctorow's future there are cars that run on vodka or fry grease, airplanes with hot tubs, comm sets that nullify texting and turn it into chatting, and circadian tribalism that offers a new system of societal organization just waiting to take over those systems we've long accepted, embraced and grown tired of. 
 It's all either already happening or is going to happen. And if it doesn't happen it will likely only be because whatever it is has taken another form. It's not prophetic, but it is fascinatingly observant. 
 Taken together, Eastern Standard Tribe and Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom suggest that Cory Doctorow has the potential to be a Canadian Philip K. Dick. I can't give much higher praise than that. But if you aren't familiar with Dick's work try this equation: 
 A non-nihilistic Chuck Palahniuk - Chuck's always disappointing third act + a smart, sci-fi kick in the ass = Cory Doctorow. 
 Check out how his ""Chi is flowing"" before they turn one of his books into a movie and taint his prose forever. He may not be the most literary rat on the ship, but his energy makes him the most likely to escape the scuttle."
5,"4.75 
 There were some parts which really just frustrates me and the characters! But all in all, the book made me feel the feels! 
 RE-READ [September 2016] 
 Still as good!"
5,"I've never been able to find a book that is not written by me (see: my 2012 manuscript titled Dearly Beloved, which I wrote when I was in the deep throes of depression) that has been able to capture the sort of fractured joy and level of self-hate in a way that I've identified with so much as I did with Sarah/Bean. 
 Because I'm going through a hard time in my life, having lost two grandparents to losing my job to losing touch with a family member I cared about more than I cared about myself, and, of course, falling back into that trench of depression I haven't visited since 2013, I've been trying to read positive, silly, inconsequential reads, because I thought my life needed levity. 
 No, it needed less levity and more spark of recognition; the main character in this book is hard-wired to self-destruct from the word go. As I listened further, I started to recognize that many of Sarah's decisions and behaviors, which I viewed as negative, scary, and self-destructive, as decisions and behaviors that are either similar to ones I've done or ones I would easily see myself doing just to keep up the guise that everything is fine. 
 This book hit me in a place I didn't know needed dealing with and now, hopefully, I'll be able to deal with that darkness that lives in me and see the stars that shine through it."
2,"Well, this was even more underwhelming than the first book. 
 Technically, there's nothing ""wrong"" with this book. There are no tropes, it's not cliched, romance never is the central spot (there's just a very slight hint of romance, actually), etc. BUT this wasn't exactly a ""good"" book either. 
 We have the same old characters from book 1, but now they're engaged in a new adventure that involves shape-shifters, theft and murder. There is more danger involved and Abigail (the narrator) plays a more important role that she did in book 1. 
 My first complaint is going to be acout the characters. I said in my review of Jackaby that my favourite character was Jackaby himself, even though he felt a bit distant. Well, in this book he felt even more far away, and he also lost his charm. His personality was the same as in book 1, and he also made funny remakrs at times, but his way of thinking felt a little inconsistent with book 1. 
 You see, this book deals with magical creatures - science cannot explain them. In Jackaby, these creatures were just fantastical and end of story. In Beastly Bones, however, there were some creatures that were tried to be given a biological origin. I could have ignored this if not for the fact that it was a strange combination of fantasy and science - you just cannot mix them without making a mess. 
 My biggest issue with this aspect was not that fantasy and science were combined in such a disorganised way, though. My problem was that this book was pretty inconsistent with the previous installment. Why change from supernatural to science just like that? You had said everything was extraordinary and lacking of logic, so why try to give it logic after you denied it? 
 I also had a problem following the plot, and not because it was complex, because let's face it, there's nothing serious or remarkable about it. No - my problem was that it was OMFG so... damn... boring. Once the mystery is settled and they have their case, they travel from New Fiddleham to another town and once there things draaaaag. 
 Okay, here's what you will get during their stay there: 
 * Digging 
 * More digging 
 * Dinousaur bones 
 * More digging 
 * Talk about slaying dragons 
 * More digging 
 * Earth excavating 
 * Removal of dirt 
 * Digging 
 One-freaking-hundred pages of just digging and describing all the sensations that went through Abigail's head while doing so. Really, wtf?! Everything felt like a filler and I kept wishing the book to be over. 
 Another aspect that really bothered me was this book's similarities with my all-time favourite books, The Monstrumologist series. 
 Yeah, so... I said it in my review for the first book. Everything about this series reminds me to The Monstrumologist. 
 * Doctor of the unknown? Check. 
 * Orphaned assistant? Check (Sidenote: Abigail is not really an orphan, but her parents don't even appear nor are important) 
 * Creatures that prey on humans? Check. 
 * Victorian writing style? Check. 
 * Set in 19th century New England? Check. 
 This one is a big fail, though. It tries too hard to be dark and scary and even bloody (please, there's only one ""violent"" scene and it's so rushed and PG that I wouldn't even count it), but if this managed to actually disturb someone, it would be a 5-year-old, and he would quickly forget about it - that's how memorable this book was. 
 Anyway, this was a huge disappointment. Book 1, even though very fluffy and predictable, was a slightly fun read; this one, on the other hand, put me to sleep most of the time. If you're looking for a quality book that deals with more scary creatures (includes humans too), is more mature and dark and questions humans and morality, I suggest reading The Monstrumologist instead. If you're looking for a mindless, immature, predictable and boring book, then I recommend this series. My job here is done."
5,Might be the best of this series so far. I love Sydney and Adrian. I love the crazy way this progresses and all the intrigue. Can't wait to read the next one.
4,"This was my favorite book twenty-one years ago, but I couldn't actually get through it a second time. Sorry, little tweenaged Emily. 
 2015 Popsugar Reading Challenge Item 33: A book from your childhood."
4,"I think I'm giving this book 4 stars because I don't think I enjoyed it as much as everyone else seems to. I did like it! I liked it a lot, and there were many parts that I definitely loved, but I'm not dying over this book. Like I'm not melting into a puddle over how amazing it is (which I have done for other books, just to clarify). I guess it's just not my cup of tea exactly? 
 It might be Rae Carson's writing style - it just doesn't do anything for me. It's not bad, I just find it meh. A lot of it feels contrived to me... OKAY, just saying that reminds me what my biggest beef with this particular book is - the ""forbidden love."" I don't like it, I don't get it. 
 ***Spoilers ahead*** 
 First of all, the way marriage is handled in this series is seriously disturbing to me. There are moments, like when Hector is talking about his parents' marriage that give me hope, but then they go off talking about having lovers, whether single or married, like it's no biggie. IT IS A BIGGIE. I just... I don't like people talking about sexual affairs so easily in conjunction with marriage, and, to top it off, marriage to another person. And then ***SPOILER*** we have Mara talking about taking Belen as a lover when, I thought, he was with Cosme... What the hell happened with that relationship? Did I miss something? Like, seriously, please tell me if I missed something! 
 Anyway, back to the forbidden love part. Elisa and her forbidden love with Hector. I don't get why it was forbidden. When I see an author proclaim a love is forbidden, then I want a sound, irrefutable reason why it is forbidden. There was absolutely no logical reason why their love had to be forbidden. And I got so sick of Elisa saying ""I can't tell him how I feel even though everything inside me wants to."" That just... really pisses me off. I understood her reasoning at first, about making a good marriage alliance, when Hector only seemed to be a great and loyal friend. But after he makes his feelings VERY clear, there was no reason for Elisa not to commit herself to him in both love and alliance. It was pointed out to her early that he was a powerful man to marry as far alliances went, whether to her or someone else. After the first kiss, THERE WAS NO REASON FOR HESITATION. 
 Elisa truly proved her cleverness in this book... except in this matter, and while it didn't make me doubt her as a character, it did make me doubt Carson as a writer. Why? Because the forbidden love was simply a plot point to create drama. It felt so contrived to me, much like Elisa's relationship with Alejandro in the previous novel. bleh 
 This is such an interesting story, the whole series. The concept is intriguing, the characters strong, and I was completely absorbed in the last half of the book. But then Rae Carson goes and throws these silly, cliched plot points in there that make it impossible for me to love it the way I want to!"
5,such a captivating book. I'm glad we got to learn more about Christian this time around it made me see him in a different light.
5,"The Tomb by F. Paul Wilson is the first in the Repairman Jack series. Although he's referred to as a repairman, Jack fixes dangerous situations not plumbing."
4,"Loved it, I just love the back and forth between Ty and Zane."
3,"Moran's breezy delivery can strike one as dismissive of other points of view, but I think that's just the delivery. I found the memoir-ish parts of this book much more interesting than the philosophizing about feminism. Worth a read, no question."
5,"I haven't read Lola and just jumped into this book. It took a long time to continue with this fluffy trilogy. 
 And I liked this book. Like, really really liked. I have no idea why people dislike Isla so much. I have to admit that her spontaneity is annoying as hell, but that personality of her didn't affect my emotion, so, yeah. (Well, some parts are embarrassing, tbh.) I think I love this and Anna equally :))"
4,I have read this twice... and even the second time I could not remember exactly how it ends. I love this series because first they are awesome.. and second.. there are so many books that you can easily reread them and still be a surprise at the end.
5,"This book has opened my appetite for Ira Levin's books. It was just superb. 
 I loved how a book written in 1950s could seem so contemporary, and I think this is the greatness of a book. That no matter when you read it, you could see it happen. 
 What I also liked that it was really short, and I could get into it faster, and I didn't get bored at all. Actually, I always wanted to read more, and more. 
 I kind of figured everything halfway, but it didn't take away the fun at all, I was still surprised by many things, and it had suspense, good story line, and a very nice writing style. 
 I'm looking forward to reading more of his work."
4,"""Having a sister is like having a best friend you can't get rid of. You know whatever you do, they'll still be there"". ~Amy Li 
 When I began reading The Sister, I had no clue it was a debut novel. The author has a knack for beautiful writing that somehow also emulates the tension. Grace and Charlie have been best friends for years. Together they have overcome elementary school bullies, teen angst, adulthood...and death. 
 Charlie is dead. Why? Charlie saved Grace in a way, raised by her grandparents, Grace was the outcast that Charlie willingly befriended. After Charlie's death, Grace opens up a memory box filled with items from the pair. Owing it to her best friend, she sets out to grant Charlie's wish of finding her father. At the same time a woman named Anna comes into Grace's life and claims to be Charlie's half sister. 
 Soon things begin to happen. Grace's live in boyfriend Dan is acting strange. She has an allergic reaction to her coffee, and much more sinister things. And who is following her? Is Anna behind this or has someone else from Grace's past come back to haunt her? 
 There are many twists and turns in this novel that is told with alternating timelines between then and now. I especially loved the characterization of each of the characters. The ending was a bit to abrupt for me, and I honestly felt like I was reading Pretty Little Liars at certain points. However, still a twisty novel I recommend. 
 Thank you to NetGalley, Lousie Jensen and Bookouture for the opportunity to read this in exchange for an honest review."
3,A nice read into Maggie & Bastian's relationship and how Will came about. Gave insight into Caden's character.
4,"I'm completely confused as to whether I loved this one or not. 
 I'm pretty sure I loved it but the whole middle was the kind of story I usually stay away from because I'm just not a fan of sobbing over sad things in books. I like happy. But even though this had that thing (I'm trying not to spoil) I liked it. I cried and it bummed me out for a while but by the end I felt...i don't even know, hopeful? 
 so. yeah. little confused after this. I can say I loved the writing as always and I really did like the characters too. They were real and I always enjoy that. 
 wow. this is a terrible review and I'm sorry!"
4,"You guys, I gotta tell you. I need to send some kind of apology letter and fruit basket to Maggie Stiefvater for my review on Shiver and how boring I continue to find it. My roommate loves books where nothing happens, and I think Shiver would be perfect for her. But, this Ravens series!! This is for me! This has all kinds of crazy-fun stuff going on! You got psychics and tarot and lay lines, and it's not all messed up by whimsy. It stays very rational and blue collar. 
 I think I might love The Scorpio Races more, but when you love something this much, why treat it as a competition? It's like choosing between your two boyfriends. No need to compete, you guys. I remember rating this book way back in ye olde days before I wrote this review, and I can only imagine I rated it at 4 stars because I decided I loved The Scorpio Races more. That is the only reasonable explanation. And, past-me was such a reasonable girl that we must assume that was the case. But, present-me is more open minded and willing to have two boyfriends, as long as they are books and make no demands on my time. So, in my heart, this is five-stars, too. It's like I'm Ben Higgins. 
 Okay, what do you want to know? You probably want to know about how I'm learning tarot, like the ladies in this book, and I'm becoming a pretty fantastic tarot reader if I do say so. The cards love me, and I love the cards. I have a very beautiful deck, and I've been following Biddy Tarot for all of my tarot questions, and it's so fun! 
 If you want to know less about me and more about the book, it is a treasure-quest, but with star-crossed lovers and magic. And assassins. Who doesn't love assassins?! Such a good type of monster. 
 The main character's name is Blue, which is awesome and not lame, so don't question it. Her mother says that in the tarot deck, the page of cups represents her. Which, that seems so sweet and mysterious to me. Like she is the messenger of new creation and love. So cool! 
 Also, one interesting thing about this book is that she is one girl in a group of guys, so you would think it wouldn't pass the Bechdel test, but it does because she lives in a house full of women who love each other and act very reasonable. 
 So, highly recommended!"
5,"This book was amazing! Thank you, SJ for recommending me this book. Full of passion, love, and steaminess. I love Dex, he was a bad tempered dude, who protects whatever he owns. I thought Iris was smart, and feisty. She was the perfect counterpart of Dex's character. I hope there will be another book with these two characters. Overall, a fantastic read."
5,"5 YUMMY ALPHA KENTON STARS 
 I really enjoyed the 'Until' series. This is a spin off starting with the boys' cousin Kenton and his love interest, Autumn. Kenton is a lovely hero- total badass , scrumptious alpha male. Autumn had been to hell and back. She was a strong but fragile heroine that I loved. Great book. Looking forward to the next one... 
 If you love alpha males, sassy heroines, seriously HOT moments with a good amount of romance, buy this book."
4,Review coming soon!
1,"1/5. 
 Are you familiar with how thin the walls are in dorm rooms? If you are, take that and multiply it by a thousand and you'll have my scenario. If you aren't, I'll give you some examples: I can't fall asleep until no one in my hall is talking. I unwantedly hear my next-door neighbors' conversations word for word. If someone upstairs is playing music I can feel the bassline. I try to be as quiet as I can since I know if I make a noise louder than a pin dropping it could wake the goddamn dead. 
 But even though I was reading this at 1 a.m. on a Wednesday (WELL after quiet hours!) I couldn't stop myself from scoffing. And groaning. And generally expressing my distaste. Loudly. I actually said ""Oh, GOD"" at the very last line of the book. To myself. In an empty room. 
 I dare you to read a teenage boy theorizing that a Grand Mystery--you know, one that spawned three novellas?--was caused by him and his girlfriend's breakup going against ~destiny~ and not want to scream into the fucking abyss. I'm sorry for the language, but how did that even get published?! How is that in print?! A 3.47 average rating is pretty low for Goodreads, but I'm honestly surprised it's not even less. Like one star, for example. Just every single reader giving this book one star. What a waste of time. I HAVE PAPERS TO WRITE, COLLEEN AND TARRYN! 
 I think I gave myself frown lines reading this. 
 It's not super well-written, and it's hard to tell whether that's because the writing itself isn't good or the characters are garbage or a mix of the two. Example: ""'I'm seventeen years old. I think I have the right to change.' This guy. I want to roll my eyes at him, but first I need him to give me more answers."" 
 I never felt intrigued by the mystery. Maybe that's my fault for launching abruptly into this having entirely forgotten the other novellas. Silas and Charlie, individually and together, made me want to GAG. But the most unforgivable aspect of this for me was just that it's dumb. 
 Dumb mistakes, like saying they're at a gas station an hour away from their destination on one page, then that they have two more hours till they get there on the next. Dumb reasoning, like seeing that two characters have small eyes and are kinda pale and assuming that one is the other's father with no other evidence. Dumb perspective, since Charlie referred to herself more in the third person than first. Just dumb choices. Why would people take pictures of Silas because he sat in a puddle? WHY?! 
 Bottom line: I politely request to punch each and every one of these characters in the face, and then have a Silas 'n' Charlie style memory loss so I never have to remember any of this book."

5,"In some way this book is a little philosophical, as it explores the fine line between live and death. Some people live but they are dead on the inside, while some people die but are remembered. Questions about life, death and the natural scales of justice of the world were discussed in this novel. 
 The helplessness Delaney felt when she sensed mortal expiry was so authentic, it was a bone-crushing invisible weight that hung on her every limb, knowing that someone was about to die but not being able to do anything anyway. 
 I love the tension between Decker and Delaney, they love each other yet they are so afraid to admit it. It's kind of perplexing, and made me feel like slapping some sense into both of them. 
 The focus on the other guy who returned from a coma - Troy - I was unsure how I felt about him, he was a little creepy, and empty on the inside, a very good liar, and probably not quite right in the head after his family died, leaving him alone in the world. 
 All in all, I felt a connection towards this book that was somewhat lacking in Miranda's other book, Fracture, which I did not really enjoyed. Fracture was well-paced and it is full of emotion and meaning. To top that, Miranda's writing in this book flows flawlessly and eloquently."
5,I didn't love it as much as On Dublin Street but it was still amazing.
4,"Review to come! 
 Notes: 
 *OMG, Evie is awesome. Her voice is funny and vulnerable all at once. 
 *Lend is adorable. 
 *Great pacing, great plot. 
 *Great mixture of humor, seriousness, and tense scenes."
3,"What worked: 
 This is going to be a shorter review because a LOT happens during The Bane and you know how I feel about spoilers. 
 I remember reading this book when it had first been published as EDEN way back when and thinking it was the best thing since sliced bread. Since then, Keary has expanded it into a trilogy and re-published Eden as The Bane with a few minor changes. It's funny how your tastes change once you start blogging. 
 The Bane is still a good story and the world is just as I remembered: broken and almost beyond repair! 
 Reading through again, the story still held me in suspense and even though I knew what was coming I wanted to push my kindle away when all seemed peaceful. 
 What irked: 
 There was definitely a bit of telling rather than showing going on that pulled me out of the story and sometimes it felt as if the pacing was a bit too fast. I'm a major re-reader and if I love a book, I'll sure as heck love it even more the second time around. With The Bane, this wasn't the case. I just felt a bit letdown in places and originally I couldn't really connect to the love interests and that was just the same this time. 
 Recommended to: 
 Post-Apocalyptic fans, it is definitely a unique concept but it was just a little 'off' to me. I would give The Bane... ***3 Stars - This book was good but a couple of things irked me.***"
3,"A very interesting look at the subject of sex lives within committed relationships. I found it very interesting and it had a lot to say. I think I'll take a lot away from it, through bits and pieces."
4,I thoroughly enjoyed this read - a smoking hot suspenseful romance. The sex was scorching.
4,"I received an ARC via NetGalley 
 Life's too short not to eat the strawberries... or fall in love! 
 After months of reading drama and tension heavy books, a light-fluffy story is very much welcomed. I've read Lauren Maurill's other book,Meant to Be, and this book has some similarities with that one. I do love this one better than Meant to Be, though; that book was really disappointing. 
 I love the comical banter of the characters, the relate-able yet out of this world thoughts our main character has, the friendship, the whirlwind romance and so much more elements. This book was surprisingly a humorous book, and I also loved that. Also, the twists were pretty predictable but it was, nonetheless, pleasing. This has been a very enjoyable read plus it was a page turner, too. 
 Little side note: I like Russ."
5,"J.R. Ward could do no wrong. 
 This short novella takes place in the BDB universe of Caldwell but our main characters, Michael and Claire, have no association with the actual BDB characters. 
 The development of this relationship was short but intense. It would have been nice if this were a full length novel because I loved Claire's attitude and maybe instead of a three day confinement, it could have been a month long confinement. You know, give the readers a little more of our beloved characters, but J.R. Ward let's her characters do the talking and they must have decided that they needed a short intense story. 
 But it's never too late to revisit these characters. Ward is writing new novels that revisit the relationships of the original brotherhood. Wrath already had his novel and now we wait for Rhage and Mary...again. I can't wait. Michael would make a great addition to the brotherhood."
5,"You guys wait, just the time I try to find the broken pieces of my heart"
5,"Extremely gut-wrenching for me and a not- so-happy ending for my taste, but still somehow one of the best books I've read in 2016"
5,This was completely different from what I expected. And it was absolutely terrific. Beautiful. Touching. Sad.
4,"This is really two books - The Boys Next Door and a follow up nSummer. 
 It's a cute fun read even though Adam and Lori make things way more complicated than they need to be. I never really understood why everyone thought Adam was a badboy - I honestly thought Lori was the bad one in this relationship :-) 
 Endless Summer was basically a repeat of the first story but still a good light summer read."
2,"Mediocre. I feel like I'm only reading for Kid Omega now. The series is called Wolverine and the X-Men, and Wolverine is barely in this volume. I could have done without this whole Hellfire Academy arc. 
 Moving on."
3,"I liked the underwater setting of this volume and the new introduction of characters. I also very much liked the plot revolving around the mushrooms, the reveals, and the cliffhanger, more so than the few volumes before this. The examination of what makes a villain and a good person was also more thoroughly examined here, and I appreciated the suspense, as well as the humorous references to the water cycle. If I remember correctly, the last two books of this series get really good."
5,Oh how i loved this book!!...the hunter in love with its prey!!!how romantically awesome is that!!!...I devoured this book in less than 24hrs!!
5,"Read review at readable.club . 
 My new website"
3,"First of all, I would like to make something clear; this is more of an erotic novel than a purely romantic one if I may say so. 
 I went into it thinking that I'm gonna read a romantic novel which may have sex in it, but it's not the main focus, and guess what! I was wrong. Maybe, just maybe, that's why I felt like it had too much sex In it, but God it had waay too much sex. Like in every freaking chapter. 
 Even when Cloe, the female protagonist, was having what could possibly be the worst day in her life, Ben, the male protagonist, still managed to get his hands on her. Aaand it was not a ""gentle touch"", aaand she did not object. In fact, she only minded when it actually became intimate... Yep! 
 Maybe it's just me, but I hate relationships that are built solely on sex. I don't think that their relationship was a healthy one; it felt like they didn't talk about or do anything other than sex. I do admit that their relationship gets a deeper and stronger by the time they leave San Diego. Their relationship became less creepy and more intimate. I found myself rooting for them to be together, and I actually enjoyed them being together (The name calling is still a bit too much). I cared for them both, and when Ben got sick, I was praying that he wouldn't have cancer. 
 Ben is one of the most unique characters I've read about; he is pretty straightforward. By the time he realized that he's grown fond of Cloe, and that he wants to be with her, he was upfront about it. He was like, hey! I want this, I want us, I don't want this to end. He didn't go into denial and try to ignore her or his feelings, and I loved that. 
 I realized that I really genuinely love romance novels with dual povs. I loved reading both Cloe's and Ben's chapters. The change of perspective was refreshing. However, I would have appreciated if we got a hint on who's talking at the beginning of every chapter. 
 Even though this novel has many problems, it's still very enjoyable. It's funny, witty, entertaining, and the writing style is really good. 
 PS: I still can't get over the fact that we didn't get to hear her say the three magical words :/."

 Screwdrivered is the third book in the Cocktail series by the hilariously talented Alice Clayton. Once again, she created great character dynamics, and kept a very detailed and intriguing story line throughout. Usually, the endless inner monologues and descriptive story telling tends to bore me, but that is where Clayton thrives. She manages to implement comedy into those parts of the story and keeps the reader captivated through the main character(s). 
 In Screwdrivered, we're reunited with Viv who was previously introduced in Wallbanger. 
 She's a walking, talking juxtaposition which I absolutely loved. She's a brilliant software designer with her own company, but harbors a passion for art. A fiery personality, tattoos and piercings, and a love for romance novels. Oh how she loves her romance books, so much so that she's convinced she's living in one. 
 So, when she gets a late night call informing her that she's inherited a ginormous home in Mendocino, California from one of her aunts, she takes it as a sign. A chance to start fresh and find adventure. Maybe even find a cowboy to ride. 
 Arriving in Mendocino, Viv's perfect romance novel continues to fit into place. She comes across a smoldering cowboy who she can't keep her eyes off of, and luckily for her, he happens to tend to the barn and animals that now belong to her. Cowboy Hank may have hunk appeal, but he doesn't seem the least bit interested. Challenge accepted. Viv's determined to work on trying to get more than a few grunts and nods out of him. After all, Rome wasn't built in a day. 
 In the meantime... 
 An uptight librarian/historian barges in claiming she can't make any changes to her new home without his consent. Clark Barrow assists Viv in the restoration of her historical landmark of a house. He never fails to get on Viv's last nerve, but she's forced to work with him. Everything about him begins to annoy her, the silly elbow patches, nerdy glasses, the way he always disagrees with her over any little thing. 
 While she may not want to admit it, Viv loves spending time with Clark. She craves his presence and their effortless banter. 
 I don't know how she didn't pounce on him as soon as they met. I would've been all over that nerdy piece of goodness in a hot second. 
 After a painful length of time, Viv's typical romance fog clears and her heart finally leads her in the right direction. 
 So does she end up taking a ride on the caveman cowboy or the stubborn librarian? 
 Great inclusion of the characters from the other books. Seeing characters I love so much return for a quick cameo always puts a smile on my face. It always seems to create a more cohesive world for a reader to get sucked into. 
 The only downfall this book had was the lack of togetherness the couple had total. I loved the tension and essentially, the denial between the two, because it made for a funny dynamic. The ending didn't seem rushed in any way, because the entire novel was building up to it. However, I loved these two characters so much, that I simply wanted, nay, needed more about them. I didn't get to relish in their new-found relationship long enough, thus depriving me of that complete experience. 
 Anyone in need of a funny, light hearted read with plenty of sexiness and comedic entertainment, pick this up or any Alice Clayton book for that matter!

4,"This books wasn't exactly what I expected coming in, though I'm not sure exactly why. Having watched Darn Ariely's two TED talks I had assumed he was working in the field of neuroscience studying human behavior. Ariely actually works in the field of behavioral economics...studying human behavior(though he certainly understands his psychology and neuroscience). Specifically he sets out to debunk standard folk psychology and economic theory that say that human beings tend to act in the most rational way based on a cost benefit analysis of a particular action or purchase. Ariely says it's just the opposite. We are all irrational, and not only irrational, but predictably irrational. That while WE don't understand the underlying causes and factors that lead to particular decisions, these decisions can be predicted, and in the right hands, manipulated. 
 The book takes the form of Ariely bringing up a certain idea and discussing how we should act or how people think they will act. He goes on to describe not one, but many experiments which drive the point home that human beings act in some surprisingly counter-intuitive ways. He ends each chapter with some philosophizing about what these experiments tell us, and how we can use the knowledge gained from them in our every day lives to make better decisions in everything from economic matters to moral issues. Instead of a self help book with some science, it's a science book with some self help. 
 Ariely is an engaging writer, weaving in personal anecdotes, jokes, and scientific analysis in one fast paced cohesive whole. My only criticism of it is that I personally would've enjoyed a bit more science. I think it would have been really interesting if after explaining the experiments and the behavior that was observed, if Ariely then went on to describe the neurological processes that underlie the behavior(he does get into a bit of the psychology, at least in a broad way). 
 Having read much in the field of cognitive science, I can extrapolate and come up with theories on my own, but I think it would've done the book a great service to include that. To explain WHY the emotional system interferes with our rational decision making. To explain the idea that the brain isn't wired for objective truth but for comparing relative value. To explain what it means and what is actually happening when we learn something false and are then unable to give it up. Though it would necessarily change the book's possible audience, so I can understand the decision not to include that aspect of things. And I do think by talking about how the results of these experiments could be applied to every day life he is helping individuals in a really practical way to improve their lives, and I think that's great. In the end the important thing for most people is to be aware of the hidden factors in our decision making process and to be able to stop and think about them. Whether they understand the nitty gritty details of the neuronal systems or the psychological theories is I guess to a certain degree superfluous."
4,"It was nice to read this story again with images and substantially less writing. 
 This was actually better than I had expected, although I'm disappointed that Jem and Will both look essentially the same in the illustrations. I mean, come on!"
2,"I'm usually a sucker for a good killer-for-hire story. And Rob Shapiro's narration on the audio book was great, one of the reasons I bought it after listening to the sample. 
 I just didn't care for the writing style. Hard for me to explain, but it felt like he overexplained everything. He wanted to make it very clear each point he wanted to make, whether it was Victor's remarkable skills and lack of emotional connection, or that his contempt for another character was evolving into something different. No nuance, nothing left to my imagination. 
 It was a rare book that I struggled to finish, but never quite gave up on. In fact, I bought two in this series during a sale, and I may even give the second book a shot. But not right away."
1,"This book actually made me upset. The book is about an eccentric boy growing up, that the everyone thinks is mentally ill in need of drugging, even the author. This points out a societal illness though. It's ok for people to be different, and if society can't handle it, then it's society that is ill not the individuals."
2,"I was pretty disappointed with this book. 
 It might have to do with the fact that I've been reading a lot of young adult dystopian lately, but I guessed just about every single detail of this book. Not impressed. 
 We have a rich girl and a poor boy. They both have superhuman abilities and brains apparently. The boy is trying to steal medicine for his family and throws a knife at a soldier during his escape, a soldier who happens to be the girls older brother. The brother is now dead and the girl is sent out to hunt the boy down."
3,"Buddy Read with Megha, Anu, Adita, Partho and Rohisa. 
 Well this is the book which inspired all the dystopian novels that came along, especially 1984. You can imagine my excitement that I was finally going to read the father of all dystopian novels. 
 I have to start by making a comparison to 1984, there is a shocking similarity between the worlds- (view spoiler)[The controlled environment, the whole story from the perspective of a protagonist scared to go against rules, a woman whose involvement makes the protagonist do things he wouldn't have otherwise dreamed off. (hide spoiler)] 
 I was a bit disappointed with 1984 after reading this because it is very clear from where the idea for 1984 came from. It pretty much took this book as an instruction manual. But 1984 corrected all the things that went wrong with this story and hence 1984 is a superior read (at least for me) 
 The writing of this book is unique. The whole book is written in mathematical interpretation and I know some of my friends found this difficult or boring to read but for me this worked out perfectly. I found the writing interesting and different (good different). 
 This whole concept of not having any individualism and following a set pattern is horrifying and intriguing all in one go. It makes you want to break the mold and live differently. Makes me clearly realize why this book was banned in Russia soo long ago - as this was published in 1924 (right around the time Russia became a communist country). 
 The main problem with this book is it lacks the urgency that is expected in a dystopian novel. I took around 14 days to read this which is a long time as per my reading speed but this is because this is a slow paced novel (which can be disappointing to people used to reading fast paced dystopia novels). 
 In spite of the slow read, overall I liked this book and hence the 3 stars."
5,"My Lady Jane is such a fantastic story, written by three YA authors: Cynthia Hand, Brodi Ashton, and Jodi Medows. Together these authors rewrote history and made it fun, enjoyable and even magical. The humor in My Lady Jane is great; I laughed a lot through out this book. Even their dedication page was full of humor and fun. 
 Their multiple POV writing style never confused me or threw me off track. In fact, I thought having multiple POV's added more to the story. All of their characters are so full and lively; I especially loved Jane and her husband, G. 
 If you're interested in YA, historical fiction, magic, or comedy then I highly recommend this wonderful novel to you. My Lady Jane is definitely one of my most favorite reads of the year. Sadly, I probably wouldn't have picked this book up on my own. I got this book in an Owlcrate and I'm so happy they chose this novel for one of their boxes."
0,Ooooooh... a Scarlet Pimpernel retelling!
5,"Another dominant billionaire and a lovable man James is another Christian and Gideon mixed into one.I just lovvveeed it, it captured me from page one and I can't wait for book 3.... 
 I loved not only the way James cared and took his time with Bianca especially with her hang ups when she pull's back and wants to run away but also how he took on Bianca's best friend Stephen and then his new partner Javier how he used money to do good and look after the woman he loves, she just doesn't know how she feels or won't admit it anyway!! 
 Bianca and Stephen are flight attendants and have known each other for a long time so it takes a strong man like James to pull the layers back. There's lots of sex but he also is lovable and warm and tender to her needs.. 
 Hurry up Febuary so we can read more of James and Bianca!!!"
5,"Full of secrets, conspiracies, words with accompanying definitions, macabre setting and equally macabre characters-- this is what a Snicket book is all about. The only thing missing is the misery that Snicket embodied while narrating the Baudelaire Children's story. The story, with its twist and turn, is incredible. If you are a fan of Mr. Snicket, you will not be disappointed, of course. If you are not a fan, better read A Series of Unfortunate Events first. If the first chapter didn't get your attention, then maybe you are not bound to be associated with Mr. Snicket. 
 Don't let the kids read this unless they have the wit and imagination for it. It just will never make sense to an ordinary kid. Lemony Snicket writes for extraordinary people-- kids and adults alike."
5,My favorite part of this was that it was from a blind girl's pov. I don't think I've ever read a book with a blind MC (unless you count Helen Keller) but this book was really good. It reminded me of the 39 Clues (good old days...); it's realistic and somewhat adventurous.
5,Loved this on audiobook! Amazing story.
5,I loved it. AJ Fikry is sarcastic and opinionated-- both are qualities I appreciate. I really enjoyed this book.
3,"So this book was good. I'd heard it was amazing, but I thought it was good. I get that the teens grew up a little faster than ""regular"" teens, but I just could not relate to the characters. They didn't feel real to me, and it took me out of the story rather than draw me in. But, it was entertaining and I did shed a few tears, because I think you pretty much have to in these situations. And I liked Hazel's mom's surprise picnics for random holidays - that's something I want to do anyway, just for fun. But in all - I think giving this book 5 stars would just be a Cancer Perk."
4,"My sister had to read this for school, and since I was not at all pleased by the other books I was just reading, I tried (and liked it) 
 STORY 
 Bruno, who grew up in Nazi Germany has to move to Out-With with his Family, because of his father's work. There he meets Shmuel, who is locked away behind a fence. 
 I'm sure we all know what Out-With and the Fence mean, do we? 
 SOMETHING OVERALL 
 I quite liked the naive way this story was told. We get to see the second world war through Bruno's eyes. We also get what he does not. 
 Since German is actually my native language this felt kind of strange in English. Bruno can't pronoune Fuhrer (he calls him Fury) and Auschwitz (Out-With). This is kind of cute at the beginning, but since he can pronounce everything else perfectly normal, and gets corrected later on, I started wondering at some point. I see how this is important for the story, but believe me, those words are not that hard , that a nine year old, could not pronounce them. 
 STYLE OF WRITING 
 Since Bruno tells everything it's quite simlple, and naive. There are a lot of repetitions. I like the way Boyne wrote it, because it gave me the feeling of beeing inside a kid's head...just maybe more like a six or seven year old one. 
 CHARACTERS 
 I don't wan't to say much about them. I think they were all quite realistically drawn, and fit the story perfectly well. 
 OPINION 
 I liked this story very much, and I think it's one you should have read. While I dislike most books we got to read for school, this one was really good. It could have just happened that way. I also liked the kind of friendship Bruno hat with Shmuel, and how he did not understand why they should be different. 
 The ending was...wow. I did not see that comming and it IS a great ending in my opinion. 
 Therefore... 
 ....go: READ THIS"
5,"O. M. G. I.LOVE.THIS.BOOK.SO.MUCH. 
 I just love bittersweet books & that leave me loving/hating a world that doesn't really exists & crying in real life. (': 
 P.S. I knew Nyx was going to do that!! I knew it! I knew it! I didn't know how she was gonna get there but I knew she was going to that :D."
3,"I unfortunately found this book to be lackluster and noncommittal... 
 The writing style has a very discombobulated feel. I did want to know what the heck was going on so I did keep turning pages. every plot twist ended unsatisfactorially. Everytime there was a hint of explanation it was only half thought out. The protagonist had so many quirks randomly thrown about with no introduction you just had to trust the author who is not a relationship builder. I don't recommend it because it should have been so much better. I won't continue to read this authors works."
3,"I think more than anything else, this was a case of too high expectations for me. I loved ""Graffiti Moon"" by Cath Crowley. It was sweet, and funny, and beautifully written. It was a unique take on the mistaken identity/ taking place all in one night idea. So when I saw that Cath Crowley had a new book, and that it was a ""book about books/book for book lovers"" I was super excited. I ended up being pretty let down. 
 Don't get me wrong. It's not a bad book. It was strongest in its study of books and ode to used bookstores. I loved the book references and the book portions of it really resonated with me. I love the idea of the Letter Library, where book lovers wrote notes and connected with strangers through said books. I just didn't really connect with the characters or the love story. 
 I loved Shadow and Lucy in ""Graffiti Moon,"" but here, I didn't really like either Henry or Rachel. Rachel spent the book grieving, and was understandably prickly and standoffish. I get that this was a symptom of her grief, but it didn't make her likable. Henry was hopelessly in love, or thought he was anyways, with an annoying and shallow character who was never fleshed out. It made him annoying, and kind of desperate. We have all been in love with the wrong person- or at least I have anyways, but Amy didn't seem to have any redeeming qualities. 
 So although I loved the bookstore and letter library, and the odes to literature, I was very disappointed. It got 3 stars because of the books parts, but otherwise, I probably would have only given it 2. I think other lovers of books will pick this up, and appreciate parts of it, but the contemporary romance part fell flat, and I can't see this becoming a big hit. If you haven't read Graffiti Moon though, I highly recommend it. :)

4,"I realized earlier this year that by focusing on the Mock Newbery lists, I was missing out on kidlit by non-American writers. Good thing I've broadened my horizons, or I might have missed ""The Imaginary""! It's creepy yet sweet, in the tradition of Gaiman and Dahl. Well, maybe not super sweet. But I did tear up at the end. And I think my kids would like it. 4.5."
4,"I do believe this is the first book I've read about zombies. 
 I enjoyed it, and take it as s good sign how often I wanted to slap the characters. Make better choices, aaargh! 
 But I like books that have infuriating characters, because I like how they make you feel something for the book's world and the people in it."
3,"I liked this book for a lot of reasons. First, will all the Dystopian novels going around these days we're not sure if the one we are choosing is a book of quality but this one did deliver. 
 I won't say i love it as much as i loved Hunger games (even if Mockingjay completely destroyed the series for me) or Matched but it was very decent nonetheless. 
 I really enjoyed having a boy as a protagonist. I haven;t read that many books with guys as protagonist and this is my first dystopian with a lead male character. 
 The back story on how the world fell might be a fiction but it's disturbingly probable. A chemical weapon P-11 propagating and killing millions....Scary. 
 Stephen is a very likable character. He is 15 and was born 5 years after the spreading of P-11 and his life has been full of loss and hardship. 
 I really like the sides characters, Jackson, Violet, Jenny etc... 
 The story is really well written and the writing style is nice the story flows nicely. The plot is well develop and you really see how people might react if the world where to fall. 
 There is a little bit of romance in it but it's very minor so don't except any heartbreaking love story and don;t expect any humor either because there is none or so little i probably missed it. 
 I sadly think humanity might react just like that and how error of the past are repeated over and over again. The end is not an evil cliffhanger but you know there will be a sequel. 
 In conclusion, it was an enjoyable dystopian novel i won't say it was in the top dystopian but enjoyable nevertheless."
5,"*** THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER FREE! *** 
 Guild Hunter novels are always so intense they cause me to lose sleep and stress out about a happy ending. This series, folks, is urban fantasy at its finest. Throughout the story, I couldn't get enough of Elena and Raphael and Illium, but I was also thrilled to get to know a few of the other members of The Seven better. Naasir and Aodhan both have significantly larger parts in this book than in any of the previous ones and their character development is superb. I'm already speculating about the relationship between illium and Aodhan, and what the heck is Naasir anyway? It was fab getting to see Honor and Dmitri again (and especially to hear her commentary on his, ah, skills), as well as newly-in-love spymaster Jason. 
 The action in this book is beyond intense and the last 30 pages just about killed me, my heart was racing so fast the entire time. Ms. Singh really amped up the danger level for ALL the characters in this one and held off on revealing the big development until right at the end. It made me crazy and jittery and glued to the pages! The story also wrapped up nicely after the nearly-traumatic ending, so there's enough time to come down from the ledge and take a safe breath again, get our proverbial feet under us before we have to wait another many months for the next installment. I want to avoid spoilers as much as possible but I will say this... 
 No matter what it feels like while reading the final chapter of this book, take comfort in knowing that it does NOT have a cliffhanger ending and it is totally worth the ride! I'm both glad it's over and impatiently awaiting the next chapter in this scintillating and addicting universe! Long live the Guild Hunter series!! This series, and Nalini Singh's Psy-Changeling world, might as well be the raison d'etre for the urban fantasy genre! Here are some fun quotes to send you off with... 
 Trying to keep her wings from trailing in the crap, [Elena] took a step inside... and a rat as big as a goddamn cat scurried over her boot. 
 Biting back her instinctive scream, she glared at Ransom - who was very conspicuously not grinning. ""You couldn't warn me?"" 
 ""You're a tough-ass Hunter who gets naked with a freaking archangel, has a miniature flamethrower - which, by the way, you should leave to me in your will - and a crossbow, all within easy reach."" His cheeks creased, eyes glinting. Rats quiver at your presence."" 
 Raphael held her gaze. ""Eternity would mean nothing without you. For no power on this earth would I trade my Elena."" 
 ""Narrow, but we can get in if we angle our bodies."" 
 ""I'm the Hunter,"" Elena reminded [Raphael]. ""I should go first."" 
 ""Of course you may go first. When I am dead.""

1,"** spoiler alert ** 
 Frankenstein, how I detest you. 
 I know, I know. It's a classic, I hear you shouting at me. How could you not like it? 
 My least favourite parts of the novel are the characters, especially Victor Frankenstein. Firstly, he gets this great idea into his head that he's going to bring another being to life. Why does this seem like a good idea to him? Well, because he's ambitious, he's proud, and he's power-hungry, too. He wants to create a new race that will love him more than any son could love a father (or words to that effect). 
 Even if you have little to no knowledge about the plot of Frankenstein (unlikely, thanks to all the awful movie adaptions), you know this is going to be a bad idea. Aside from the foreshadow all over the place, you just know . But Frankenstein goes to graveyards and collects dead body parts so he can construct a man out of it, who he can then bring to life. 
 AND THEN HE'S SURPRISED WHEN THE CREATION IS UGLY. You made the body out of corpses ! He's hardly going to be the prettiest bauble in the box, is he? Let's be honest, that was always going to happen. And then, because of the time period and maybe because Mary Shelley wanted to criticise the Romantic movement that her husband was a part of which glorifies beauty (and who wouldn't? Especially as she wrote the novel while staying with Shelley and Byron, for God's sake), she makes Frank-y abandon the Monster, just because of his ugliness. As though that really means anything at all. 
 Also, surely he saw what the Monster was like while he was putting him together? Why was this such a surprise? 
 Cue Frank-y spending the rest of the novel whiny and feeling guilty and letting innocent people die and stuff because he hasn't got the balls to do anything about the Creature that's going around murdering people BECAUSE OF HIM. One line really stands out to me. It was something along the lines of 'People would pity me, but I just blame myself'. No, Frankenstein, people don't bloody pity you. They blame you, because it's your fault. 
 There's also a lot of description of the nature and heavy-handed pathetic fallacy going on. It's a thrill to read, I assure you. 
 The only vaguely interesting part of the book was the Monster's narrative, and that's what saved this book from the dreaded 1 star. The Monster is completely Frankenstein's opposite. He is a well thought out character, he is likeable, he makes you pity him. He is obviously the real victim in the novel, not Frankenstein, and it's actually quite heart-breaking to see him being rejected again and again because of the way that he looks. He is by far the best character in this novel, and the one that I, personally, feel I can relate to the most, which is strange, considering he's 8 foot tall and was made out of dead body parts. 
 Elizabeth is a kind of non-character throughout the book. It would have been nice for her to be a bit of a stronger female character, but I suppose we get that through the Monster's recount of Safie (which I didn't really understand why it was there. It's a nice side-story, but doesn't really add anything to the main plot). Actually, the purpose of almost all of the female characters was to just show the oppression they face at the hands of males in the patriarchal society (at least, I hope this is the case, otherwise Mary Shelley did not take after her mother and was not a feminist). 
 The ending was kind of anti-climatic. Frankenstein died, the Monster sails off to kill himself. I think, in the end, no matter what he did, the Monster was still the most innocent of the two characters. I can't stand Frankenstein, he was too whiny and why didn't he just do something? He could have at least tried to save everyone's life. 
 Overall, though I'm glad I can now say that I've read Frankenstein, I didn't really enjoy reading it. The writing was filled with too much description, it was a bit monotonous, and I felt stilted at times. The potential was there, but it just didn't live up to it. The basics of the plot were good, it's a pity Mary Shelley can't write for toffee."
3,"3.5 stars. These comics are so fun, and I love the art style!"
0,"I'm sorry but, what the hell? I was looking forward to reading this story from Mephisto's perspective, a Dom's perspective, especially as Annabel Joseph does BDSM so unapologetically well. Maybe I should not be so surprised but this 1.5 adds nothing to the story, it is simply the same book again with he said turning into she said. 
 Not rating it as it's the same book, you can check out my review of book 1 if you want to know more. Just this - yes this was a freebie when I got it but I'm so angry right now for this waste of time!"
3,"I really liked On the Edge with its good plot, characters and the author's trademark humour shining through. The conversations between Rose and Declan amused me. 
 But despite all this, the book failed to leave a mark. I guess, after The Kate Daniels series, I expected something equally exceptional. Maybe my expectations were too high, but somehow, the book failed to deliver. 
 A nice light read, really good if you haven't read Kate Daniels yet."
4,"Anthologies are a tricky thing but all in all I enjoyed a lot of the stories, so four stars all in all. 
 ""The Thirteenth Hex"" was a solid Jordan L. Hawk, so 4 stars. I enjoyed it very much. 
 ""The Soldati Prince"", Charlie Cochrane Cochet - I enjoy whimsical. This is just not my kind of whimsical. I expected as much since I DNF ""Lessons in Love"" for the exact same reason. Different wave lenght. Doesn't make it a bad story. Just not for me. 2.5 stars rounded up to 3. [EDIT: I just noticed that I mixed up Charlie Cochrane with Charlie Cochet. Still don't like the story much.] 
 ""Lou Harper - One Hex Too Many"" - Mmmh, Lou Harper, I like her. So far, sooo good :-) 4 stars. 
 ""Magically Delicious"", Nicole Kimberling - ok, one or two really, really clunky sentences, and I do wonder what ""security breeches"" are good for. Do you wear them when you don't want people to get into your pants? 3 stars. 
 ""Everyone's Afraid of Clowns"", Jordan Castillo Price - That woman can do no wrong in my eyes. Very good PsyCop short with a Halloween theme. 5 stars! 
 ""Dim Sum Asylum, Rhys Ford"" - The world building was a bit too much of a good thing - unless there is an established universe I don't know about. Some very new and confusing concepts about the fae. Noir touch. 3 stars. 
 ""Swift and the Black Dog"", Ginn Hale - again, maybe a little too much world building but I liked it. Anti-hero-hero. 4 stars. 
 ""A Queer Trade by KJ Charles - loved it. Magpie Lord Universe. 5 stars."""
5,"This is probably one of my favorite books in the YA genre. You basically know that something terrible is going to happen from the very beginning - I mean, look at the cover - but that doesn't mean The Thing That Happens doesn't shock you with its intensity when it arrives like a bowling ball to the face. Seriously, I haven't cried so much from a book since The Fault in Our Stars. 
 It's a stunning telling of one girl who is just weird - not nerd-weird, but weird in general - and she's with this dude because it's just easier than facing what's right next door or across the street or whatever, and dammit I totally asked my best friend to throw me a tiara party because of this book. I don't know if it's just me that can relate to this book and everything in it - maybe I'm just weird in general - but it's these strange little ethereal quirks such as the tiaras that are so unique, yet so simple. Autumn is this girl who is an annoying teenager that doesn't know anything, but she doesn't annoy me, and I think that's the whole point. She does dumbass things that you want to shake her for, but she's not a dumbass. She's really an intelligent person. She has this grand ability to read these situations, while not even knowing she's doing it, and throughout the whole book, she uses said ability to read herself, and, again, without even knowing she's doing it, point herself in the right direction. She is just a wonderful human being who is perfect to me because she is flawed in all the right ways. I love her - she reminds me a bit of Grace in Shiver - and I love Finn, and I just wanted to fucking die at the end because Nowlin has this intense way of bleeding emotions all over the page without being too wordy or a showoff. 
 Honestly, this is my book. There's a thing going around that the first author that successfully writes a book wherein the protagonist falls in love with the reader will be the ultimate AuthorGenius, but I think Nowlin came pretty damn close because I fell in love with Autumn and I'm not even a lesbian. 
 I love the YA genre because of books like this. I hate the YA genre because of books not like this. And I know that is extremely closed-minded, to say if it doesn't stand out of the genre and is beautifully written and is not annoying and doesn't use the word totes or something, I won't like it, but it's the truth. We need more books like The Fault in Our Stars, Eleanor and Park, and now If He Had Been with Me. They are important and they test the banality of the entire teenage society and I think a lot of people - adults included - could learn from its brilliant test of humanity."
5,I loved getting to know those characters better. I especially McGonagall's story. It is just so so nice to learn all the little things about these people and this world that it literally warms my heart. I am in such a Harry Potter mood it. I love it.
4,"Good conclusion to a 3-book story arc. (view spoiler)[Bes comes back! He's my favorite! (hide spoiler)] I admit that I wasn't too crazy about Sadie's point of view, but Carter was great and I guess Riordan wanted to show true sibling antics. I would love if Riordan wrote more about these guys!"
4,"Actual Rating: 3.5 stars 
 After reading The Friend Zone, I have to say that it is very hard to top that book. I still liked The Game Plan, but I did find the book more contrived and especially towards the end, it felt quite forced and dragged out. I still loved the characters though. Fiona was such a riot and so much fun; also the perfect balance for Ethan's quiet character and to bring out a different side of him. I also loved the Grayson and Ivy cameo, my only complaint is that I love them so much that they do steal the limelight from Fiona and Ethan and makes me crave more story revolving around the wrong couple. Still a great book but doesn't top my favourite in this series yet."
2,"(view spoiler)[ Nova and Cuisto's mother. seriously? ugh! and that constant thing with Tino, multiples... no, just no. 
 Lovely family values everyone's got. It's all about protecting your family (and the friends who become family). But treating everyone else like expendable dirt is okay. Hey, as long as everyone's happy, why not? 
 *sigh* I forgot this was not the author who knew the difference between their and there. Btw, even southerners don't all of them say ""ain't"". Not classy ones. They tend to skip the ain'ts most of the time!! 
 (hide spoiler)]"
5,"Re-Read 2017 
 So I maybe read this entire thing last night in one sitting. No regrets! You know, except for the part where I got less than 6 hours of sleep and had to get up and go to work today. 
 I adore this book and after reading the Phillip novella I had to re-read and now I want the whole book from Phillip's POV. 
 Can't wait for her new book to come out. 
 And this is weird AF. If Goodreads has my read dates correct, I read it exactly on the same dates 3 years ago."
1,"I really liked Two-Way Street. I'm planning to pick up Right of Way when it comes out in paperback (keeping my fingers crossed!). But this book was so disappointing for me. 
 It had a promising, intriguing plot. I was able to get through the first few chapters with some kind of interest, but I started to hate Eliza. Hated being in her head. Hated her way of thinking. She was just too immature, too overly dramatic, and too whiny and selfish. 
 Cooper was the only interesting character to me -- and ONLY because he was mysterious. I couldn't figure out what he was thinking, and it kept me guessing. Her friends, Marissa and Clarice, were shallow and not even there for her for a portion of the first night. I didn't feel like they had any inkling of a ""best friend"" relationship. To me, it felt like they were there just because. 
 A major problem for me was the writing style. This could've been an interesting read if a) Eliza wasn't a freaking airhead and b) if the ""contents"" of the notebook were more intense. All the stuff she wrote were pretty trivial, and when she says later that ""I can't stand up for myself because not all the secrets in it are mine."" I mean, what kind of idiot writes a bunch of stuff you're afraid to do and then includes secrets that aren't your own? It's called a DIARY. 
 Example of Eliza being an airhead that completely turned me off from reading anymore: 
 ""Nigel and his friends are really into craps, apparently. But I don't think it's the normal casino type of craps, it seems very shady what they do, with all sorts of weird rules. And of course they're not winning money from the casino, they're taking money from each other. Which is weird, you know, since they're all friends. But whatev..."" 
 I hate to break it to you, Eliza, but just because you're ""friends"" doesn't mean you don't take money from each other. Have you never heard of bets between guys? *eyeroll and face palm* 
 I ended up flipping though the rest of the pages just to find out how it even ends. The last few pages wrapped things up nicely, and I liked how Eliza has some sort of epiphany. But, I wish I hadn't spent $10 on this book because I'm not keeping it. After this book, I'm going to be more careful about picking up a Lauren Barnholdt book."
3,"I read a review from someone who said the book was so scary they had to put it in the fridge at night 
 I'm pretty sure they lied. 
 The book is creepy, but not once was a scared. I've been more freaked out in the first 100 pages of the shinning than I was in the entire 700 pages of House of Leaves 
 I found Johnny's story confessing and not at all enjoyable. I did like the Navidson story but it was so incomplete and not like Ill Will where you feel like you've missed something and are scared of the killer more like oh.... I guess we are done here."
4,"4.25/5 
 the first 2/3 of this book were entirely plotless, and i read an ARC version so it was highly unfinalized. for this section, i was sure it was a 3 star read. 
 but then something happened, and it made me cry. 
 and the senior-year feelings of the characters were so well done. the impending dread Dill felt, his perception of being left behind--i really relate to that. and the sadness and excitement of the next chapter, of new opportunities and the ends of friendships--i'm leaving for college in less than a month, and all of that made sense to me too. 
 this book hurt to read, but it was a necessary hurt."
3,"Little bit creepy, historical mystery. The end was a bit cheesy for me, but I was glad to finally see some character development in the protagonist. Also interesting to learn about the Cherokee Seminary, which I had never heard of."
5,"This book is wonderfully weird and educational, while being hilarious at the same time. Not for those with queasy stomachs or uptight views on human remains."
4,I've never read any Riordan and I really loved this and can't wait to read more of this series. His knowledge on Egyptian mythology is great and I feel like you can learn a lot from this book without knowing it. My teen book club really enjoyed it as well gave it 4.5 stars.
5,"Yup...5 stars on the second read, too! Such fun books! Thanks KMM!"
3,Storybook characters in the modern world is a fun conceit. Occasionally I find Fables bit more gratuitous than I feel is necessary.
3,"A better-than-bad/boring read that's entirely forgettable 
 STORY- the plot of the book just loses itself quarter way through. Admittedly its idea of the story is interesting but it doesn't live up to itself. 
 There's not a lot happening in the bookm besides the angst, drama, Matt and his glasses and some more drama. 
 The story is forgettable even whilst reading the book. 
 WRITING- the writing is good, enjoyabke even, for a debut author. 
 Though the plot ran weak, the characters were incredibly well crafted. 
 I do wish that the THEN chapters appeared before the NOW chapters bc it just made everything a little confusing. 
 I look forward to the author's future works 
 CHARACTERS- this was def the best of the book. The secondary characters were as I said, well-crafted & presented with a great amount of well, character! I enjoyed the stories of the secondary characters more than I enjoyed Matt & Ella's story. 
 Ella was yet another forgettable felmale protagonist who fails to deliver her lines & make an impression. I questioned her judgement and choices but, they're hers 
 Matt was a charcter i did not care for at all. I did not connect to him & i didn't like or not like him, he was just bleh whatever 
 Jake was the best character in this book. There was alot of depth to his character of which Matt/Ella should have had more of. I kind of fell for him & would looove a spin off book on him. 
 The rest of the gang- Meg, Gabby, Evan, Barker- were fabulous. I loved them."
1,"Drivel. 
 Basically, ""follow your dreams at the risk of all else and all the world will magically align to help you succeed even when it appears that you have been abandoned."" The message could be inspiring to some, but it came across as lukewarm and potentially dangerous in its heedlessness to me. The delivery was also pretty juvenile."
1,Why are y'all glamorizing pedophilia. WHAT IS WRONG WITH Y'ALL?
4,"I'd probably give this series closer to a 4 overall, but because of the fact that I devoured all three books in a week, I'm giving it a 5. 
 I'm a bit disappointed in this third book. I really appreciated in the second book that the characters' relationships seemed to be changing as the characters changed themselves, but then she just changed all that in the third book. So yes, I'm bitter that my ship didn't prevail. I loved that character so much and they just weren't used to their full potential. 
 And then my most hated YA trope happened and I was so, so horribly sad. 
 BUT, I did feel all warm and squishy inside by the end. 
 And now I feel like I need to re-read Six of Crows."
3,"Good and enjoyable enough. Nothing terribly wrong with it, but nothing outstanding either."
4,"To save her nephew, Emila (Mia) blackmails her childhood crush Evander (Vander) to marriage. Not understanding Mia's reasons, Vander gives her 4 nights a year in their marriage agreement, for which she has to ask for. 
 A story that kept my interest throughout although at times I felt it could have moved along faster. 
 Teased by Vander's friends at 15 Mia has a lot of insecurities about her looks. Vander has his own family issues and has his cruel moments. I liked them together, and I at least understood how Vander felt. 
 I didn't enjoy Mia's rough drafts and plot points as an author. I just want to read the story, not the story that mirrors the story."
5,"Oh I loved this one!! Why is this one so far into the series? This is what I've been wanting! I mean, I get why it's so many stories in, it has to be, but (view spoiler)[Simon and Izzy finally get back together! (hide spoiler)] And the story about The Circle was extremely interesting."
3,"This installment of the Night Huntress series fell a bit flat for me. I really enjoyed Cat's reflections on how her relationship with Bones has progressed, but I felt like the main plot was too drawn out, and (view spoiler)[I thought it was very obvious who the third victim was going to be. Bones is sharp - I think it would have been more believable had he figured it out sooner. (hide spoiler)] 
 There's just something about Denise's character that rubs me the wrong way, and I can't put my finger on what it is. Except for the second book of the series, which I liked her in, I feel like she bogs down the story. I just don't feel any chemistry between her and Spade. 
 Overall, it was an OK read, but I probably wouldn't reread this one like I do the first two."
4,"In this book we go back to the characters in the first one and i really liked it. we get to see more of what's happening to Captain Param and the changes due to the hound blood. This one has a lot of fights and new characters and we get introduced to the concept of the Mortal Sword. Awesome!!! 
 Param does not disapoint."
2,"**1.5 stars** 
 I really wanted to like this book. The whole idea of it was unique and I was exited to start it. But that was before I actually started reading it.. 
 Unfortunately, the mediocre writing and bland characters ruined it for me. I just couldn't get into it. Every time I came across something along the lines of ""yeah, aliens suck"" in the book I wanted to cringe, because that's not good writing! I mean, come on. The fact that the author put that in the book about 20 times made me drop a star. Originally, it was supposed to be 3 stars - but then I realized I didn't like the book at all. 
 Overall, 1.5 stars. Simply because nothing was likeable in this book, besides the introduction of the novel - but even that wasn't better than mediocre. I don't think I'll be reading this book again because if I couldn't get myself to like it while reading it then it's not for me."
4,"I absolutely loved that Brom made this his own story. It's a retelling of Peter Pan, where the only similarity is that the main character is an immortal boy named Peter who takes kids to a magical place. That's about where the similarities end. This is so incredibly darker than the original tale (and definitely more so than the Disney version). 
 Plus, he came up with his own back-story for Peter, explaining how he is the way he is. I really appreciated that. Most of the other Peter Pan versions I've read, you usually just take for granted that Peter is immortal. It was nice having a back-story for him and seeing his early life. 
 Another thing Brom did really well was make some infuriating characters. They were supposed to be infuriating, unlike some characters I've read where you're supposed to like them but they're annoying as all hell. These characters were supposed to make you grind your teeth and want to strangle them. Boy, I definitely did want to strangle them. I did have to put the book down a few times because I was so frustrated with some of the things these characters did. It made the book feel so much more realistic, having so many frustrating characters in the book. 
 I think my favorite part, honestly, was Brom's drawings. They were so beautiful and really helped me understand what some of these characters and locations were supposed to look like. I did really enjoy those. 
 I will admit, after a while the writing style got to me. There wasn't much variation in sentence structure. Also, Brom seemed to have a slight aversion to using pronouns. He used them as little as possible, and instead kept using the name of the character; and nearly all of the sentences started that way, with a character's name. So I did start to get a tad bit tired of his writing style after a while. 
 I sort of wish I had paced myself more with this book. I read half of it in a day, and then sort of burned myself out. So I did have a hard time picking it up after that; I sort of made myself read it. 
 Despite that, I still enjoyed it! I'm just a moron. 
 I really did like this story. It was very imaginative and awesome. It just wasn't perfect. I'd heard a lot of great hype about this book, so I'm a tiny bit disappointed, but I did still enjoy it."
4,"4 stars 
 I first read this book ever some 30 years ago when I was 15. By then I had already read Jane Austen's P&P, S&S, Mansfield Park, Emma and Persuasion. Even back then I recognized Austen's genius at gently poking at the absurdity of what some people deem most important in life. And though Ms. Heyer is no Miss Austen she was also great at gently poking. 
 Ms. Heyer has rightly been called the grand-dame of the modern Regency romance. If you are a fan of Jane Austen's and wish that she had had the time to write many more novels then you really should read Georgette Heyer."
4,"So, I picked this one up on something of a lark. Not that I don't like the author's work or anything, because I do. I just wasn't really looking for this at the time I saw it, and it was an ""aw, what the hell, why not"" buy, sort of like impulse-buying a pack of gum or candybar at the check-out counter because it's in your face at the time. 
 This was quite the entertaining read. I didn't have a great idea of where I thought it was going to go, and I put together the wrong clues at first. And there were some red herrings too, which kept me guessing. All of this I enjoyed because I wasn't ever sure how it would play out. But it all worked. And I could definitely see the possibility for other stories in this universe for a couple of the secondary characters, with the ability for these guys to still show up in the story too. 
 So: Murder mystery with serial killer? Check. 
 Post-apocalyptic government-created genetic mutations? Check. Check. 
 Overprotective lovers, owners, and friends? Check. Check. Check. 
 Definitely worth the read."
2,"Having enjoyed several books written for 'Young Adults' I thought I would give this series a try, but although the Gallagher Academy is a nice idea the book was really written as a children's story and unfortunately I am just not the right audience for a pre-teen book."
4,"""This is it. My whole world in one room."" 
 through climax so wonderfully built, this quote was a kick in my gut and I admit I begin to sob upon reading it. This was such a good reflection of Kamala's character development and also an amazing exhibit of how much she got comfortable in her own skin, with her own family and community. 
 To me, Last Days were a love letter to Kamala. Though the enemy was bigger and better than any of those in other issues -as they targeted someone so dear to Kamala- her remedy to problems were better in their nature as well. Her confronting with her mother and brother about the issues that bothered her for a long time, meeting with her idol, Carol Danvers and fighting alongside with her to save her own city but this time working not for but with her community to save the day, facing up the biggest challenge of all, apologizing to her best friend and partially getting things back on track. The optimism has always found a place in Ms. Marvel comics but this time it was more gut-wrenching than ever. 
 G. Willow Wilson has made family & community center of the book just like she did other very significant issues center in other books and she did it remarkably well."
4,"Expectations have been my enemy so far, in this series. My favorites were the ones I had the lowest expectations for. No longer. I expected this one to be good, hoped it would be, and it exceeded those expectations. 
 You know going in (because you've read the rest of the series, right? Right?!?) that Wulfric is going to be a tough nut to crack. His defenses are so far up he might as well be all wall. We've seen his love for his siblings, so we know he's worth it, but it's going to take some doing for an outsider to break in. As such, Christine wasn't really much of a surprise. There weren't a lot of personality possibilities for someone capable of bringing Wulf into enough vulnerability to fall truly in love. And yet, if not a surprise, she was certainly a delight. I love that she's so free with her joy and that she's so open in her entertainment and fun. I loved seeing her deal with his stoicism and reserve. And I really loved seeing her fall for him as she penetrates his defenses and gets to know the man underneath. 
 And Wulf himself was everything we thought he'd be. I particularly enjoyed, though, the sense that Christine wasn't so much changing him as restoring him. This was a subtle nuance to the story that I rather latched onto and enjoyed thoroughly. 
 So yeah, a worthy wrap-up. I'm not sure this beats Slightly Sinful. They have similar themes of restoration and Balogh pulls both off magnificently. This one might edge SS a bit for its lighter intrusion of modern mannerisms, but then lose that edge as the side characters weren't quite as fun. So a draw. At any rate, well worth getting this far in the series and a great read. 
 A note about other reviews and comparisons to other works: Others try to point out the similarities with Pride and Prejudice. Personally, I think it's a strain. He doesn't insult her. She's not so much prejudiced as informed. He's fully aware of her charm from the first. The only real similarity is his bumbling initial overtures and that's a very faint similarity to try to rest on. Now if you'd compared it to Beauty and the Beast you have a much stronger case... 
 A note about Steamy: Standard for the series, so two mid-sized explicit sex scenes that put it in the middle of my steam tolerance. They also play key roles in the emotional arc of the story, so they're pretty well integrated and thus not gratuitous."
5,"Such a great insight into OCD, and how to beat it. I loved the characters, and the story and the quiet determination of both men. I even liked the b*tch of a mother when I realised she was simply being over protective. That was a breath of fresh air really, since I've read so many stories with characters like this who don't get a chance to redeem themselves. I guess this was part of the healing process and in the end everyone healed, or was on the road towards healing."
3,"Linger was just as beautifully written as Shiver (see review). The love between Sam and Grace was really beautiful. I could really feel their love through Maggie's writing; the emotions were so clear. In fact the emotions of all the characters were strong and compelling. 
 In linger, Maggie uses two more points of view (POV): Isabelle and Cole. Both of these characters were complex with hidden torments and motivations. All the characters were completely human. No character was perfect. All were realistic in that that had times where they could be selfish or considerate. Isabelle and Cole were not always kind or sensitive but this did not make them unlovable. They had too much character and enough redeeming qualities to move them away from bad or unfeeling to complex and relatable. In fact Isabelle was my favourite character. Their story of improving themselves, self-forgiveness and healing was touching and confronting. I also adored how honest and upfront Isabelle was. 
 However, once again, I found Linger slow to read. Not really a lot happened for the first half of the story. While the characters explored their relationships with each other, their own feelings and reminisced a lot for the purpose of character introduction, when I got to half way and thought about what had happened it was interesting to realize that I couldn't really identify much of a plot-line. As a result of this I enjoyed the second half of the book far more than the first half. While I liked the introduction of Isabelle and Cole the four different POV's contributed to slowing down the plot progression. In essence, the story had emotional development with little plot development. The exception to this was the cliff-hanger ending. The ending was well thought out and interesting leading to a (potentially) really good book with Forever. 
 While I enjoyed Linger I can't say I think it is as good as the hype lead me to believe (sorry to those who loved it). In fact there were times when I was a little bored and went off to do other things even though there was nothing else I particularly needed or wanted to do. While Maggie's lyrical writing makes wonderful quotable material; I don't think the story was particularly memorable. 
 My rating out of 5: 
 3/5"
1,"I know tons of people love this author. I hadn't read any until now. I got about 60 pages in, but I'm just SO FREAKING BORED. Other than using world-specific words that aren't elaborated on, the world-building seems to be nil. I'm sure it's got to get better if so many people love these books, but I just am not having the patience to stick with it. None of the characters are being fleshed out in even the tiniest of ways. I give up."
5,just finished this and UUGHH the ending was SO good and unexpected yet so frustrating because now i have to wait until JULY to find out what happens next JFHASLHDFLAAJFHAKHD.

 Sydney has gotten over her prejudices against vampires and is now in a relationship with Adrian. However, things are not going smoothly between them knowing that Jill can see their every moment together and having to hide their relationship from everyone, especially Sydney's little sister Zoe. However, Sydney wants to get closer to Zoe and try to convince her that the Alchemists are not as perfect as they have been brought up to believe. With Sydney trying to keep so many things secret, such as her magic, and Adrian struggling with his Spirit will they be able to keep their relationship a secret while still enjoying their time together. 
 The Fiery Heart is the brilliant fourth book in the bloodlines series but is a bit different from the other books as it is from the POV of both Sydney and Adrian, however, this adds much more to the story. This book is really romantic, much more than any other book of Mead's which I have read, but this did mean that there was less mystery and action but there was enough that it did not feel lacking. 
 We can really see how much Sydney has changed during this series as in the first book she was much more like Zoe, although a bit more open because of the events of Vampire Academy, but now she thinks much more for herself and does not just want to please her father and the Alchemists. However, this book is much more about Adrian and his struggles with Spirit, and I love seeing inside his head as we get to see how much he loves Sydney and how responsible he has become while still being the Adrian we have grown to love. The romance in this book is amazing and I love seeing Sydney and Adrian as a couple and them both knowing how much they need each other, and mean to each other. 
 The ending, whilst I knew it was coming, is a massive cliff-hanger and I am not sure how I am going to cope until Silver Shadows comes out. I would recommend The Fiery Heart to people who have enjoyed the rest of this series."
3,"Feed Area X but do not antagonize it, and perhaps someone will, through luck or mere repetition, hit upon some explanation, some solution, before the world becomes Area X. 
 This book was fine. I have no strong feelings about it one way or the other. I was expecting to be scared (I mean, I'm the girl who read The Shining in the middle of the Texas hill country at night and still have residual terror from that experience), but for whatever reason I wasn't. I attribute this to the biologist's narration: she is such a sociopath that I was never too concerned about her impending demise. (view spoiler)[I did find the lighthouse and the psychologist's death very creepy, though. (hide spoiler)] 
 I'm probably going to read the next two, but mostly because I want some closure! As far as sci-fi-pit-in-the-ground goes, I like Wool better."
5,4.5 out of 5 stars and my 3rd favorite of the novellas so far. Sam and Celeana's love story is so romantic and it is such a strange way of reading to already know the tragic conclusion. But it is that time... Time to read the 5th and final novella.
4,"For my review check out my blog. 
 https://diaryofabookwormartist.wordpr..."
1,"Catching Jordan does not do justice to the YA genre, lurve triangles, college football or girls who aspire to play traditional ""boy"" sports. For a better, I mean completely different league better, book about a girl who plays football, pick up Dairy Queen and forget this one. 
 In Dairy Queen, protagonist DJ Schwenk struggles with the reality of a girl playing a tough, physical boy sport. She deals with different degrees of acceptance. She balances her hopes, dreams and the realities of her situation. Unlike Jordan here. 
 Let's see, Jordan is a high school senior, and daughter of a NFL pro. Not only is her dad a NFL hero, but in college he was a two-time Heisman trophy winner. Um...what the fuck with the slap in the face to Archie Griffin??? The man who happens to be the only real life two time Heisman winner, and an alumni of The Ohio State University! (On that note, author Miranda Kenneally clearly has a beef with Ohio State... her players don't care when Ohio State scouts come to the game but get their panties jockstraps in an uproar when scouts from the team up North come to check them out. Whatever :P) 
 At any rate... Jordan. Her dad is a football hero. Her brother is doing quite well in college ball. And Jordan herself has been her town's star quarterback since she was in grade school. So it is accepted that she is a kick ass football player, despite being a girl. Uh huh. I get it. Really. Girls can do anything boys can do. Except... sometimes they can't. Sorry ladies. But physically girls simply don't measure up. We don't. So while a girl may be able to compete with some guys, in the end guys are bigger, have more muscle mass and therefore more strength. Yet Jordan seems to think that she has a shot at winning a full football scholarship at a Division I-A football school. Do you know how very difficult that is? For talented football playing boys??? Let alone a girl? She says she loves football and wants to play football... which I can believe. But why must she go to the best of the best? To compete in a sport in which girls can't possibly compete? What the fuck is wrong with going to a smaller school? Do you know how many high school kids may be hometown (or even statewide) heroes and have to make the heartbreaking decision between accepting a scholarship to a Division I-A school and probably not getting field time because of the talent and the competition... and accepting a scholarship at a smaller and less prestigious school yet getting lots of playing time because the competition isn't nearly as fierce? When boys, talented boys, are faced with this decision... it is difficult for me to believe that a girl would be recruited by (and play at) a Division I-A school. 
 Furthermore, the kids in this book casually make statements such as, ""He's NFL material"" Uh, what? Firstly... going from high school football to college football is such a huge leap. So many high school stars simply fizzle out when it comes to college ball. And the transition from college to NFL is an even greater one. In so many ways, it is an entirely different game. 
 Anyway..... the ""sports"" aspect of this book severely disappointed me. Clearly, LOL. As for the lurve aspect... cliched triangle. Jordan was shallow, the story line was unrealistic. Lurve triangle at its worst. Sorry, but there was nothing redeemable or enjoyable about this story."
2,"Okay Just Remember to Breathe wasn't the worst book I've read, but it's up in my top 5. To be blunt, I really gave the extra star because I'm too bloody soft, which is absolutely rubbish. 
 Though I did finish it this time round after having it on pause, so I guess you could add that to my list of reasons for that extra rating. 
 Just Remember to Breathe was a jumbled, cheesy, sook fest. There wasn't one character that I connected with, on ANY level. 
 At times I somewhat enjoyed Dylan's POV's - emphasize on the 'somewhat.' 
 Alex. Where do I start. She drove me up the wall. Her crying, her gushing. To be completely honest, there were times I skipped her thinking POV and eventually stopped when someone started talking. 
 The relationship was broken and cliched. Like a lot of others, there was a huge lack of communication. 
 We also were never given the chance to see how they fell in love. We were told how they met. This happened, that happened, but never got to experience what it was like watching them 'fall in love'. Maybe to an extent we were shown bits and pieces, but mostly just told. 
 So in return we were just supposed to believe and accept this loved up relationship, without witnessing it for ourselves. WTF! 
 Little things here and there drove me wild, they probably seem real insignificant now, but at the time i wanted to puke. 
 For example: 
 ""My turn to freak. Because the thought of her, and strawberry lip gloss, was too much to contemplate."" 
 Are you insane? really. Why? I don't understand. 
 That's one of many, but as soon as I saw this written, I thought 'god I have to highlight this awful, awful disaster.' 
 You cant love every book you read, and unfortunately this is one of those times. 
 Moving on."
0,"I interrupted reading it over Christmas and realised I wasn't all that compelled to go on with it afterwards. It's like I've got far enough into it to get what its about and the characters don't grab me enough to care that much about reading to the end. I already know what the ending is, so that's probably my own fault for reading spoilers. It's a great and important book, but I'm done with it for now. Maybe one day I'll finish it."
0,"I'm going to DNF this one, so no rating. I only made it to page 87 (Chapter 2) and I am just not interested in continuing. Maybe another time."
4,"loved this, it was like stephen brust or emma bull. Fantastic fantasy story I highly recommend. she's a low level magic user with a bunch of high power friends poking her nose in dangeroous places and occasionally getting it burned."
3,"Link to blog review; http://draluvsbooks.blogspot.com/sear... 
 Thank God it's over. I wouldn't have disliked this book so much if the characters didn't make me so mad. Rose was immature, a cry baby, and naive. Her decision in the end was stupid too. She let Noah push her around too much. Do not even get me started on Noah. He's manipulating, arrogant, and rude. He was convinced he could get Rose to do whatever he wanted. He actually was thinking of ways Rose could ""bend to his will"". Everything he did made me mad. I don't mind Rose much actually. She's a teenager who's never been in love before, so she's convinced he's the one. I pity her. I hope in the next book she comes to her senses and changes her mind."
5,"First off I feel like I MUST warn readers that if you read this on an empty stomach (like I unfortunately did) you will start to drool and dream of pizza and fries! Fair warning! 
 I have read my fair share of Sarah Dressen novels (six to be exact) so I knew what to expect going in and after viewing Dressen novels in a certain way (cute, fluffy, family focused) this still blew me out of the water. In a way it was the same, typical Dressen novel. It was cute and fluffy (the romance), and it was family focused (meaning the romance takes a back seat to the inner workings of the main character's family) and Dressen novels usually have a darker element to them, such as in Just Listen where the heroine's sister is anorexic. Dressen doesn't shy away from darker topics there was something about the combination of all these elements really resonated with me. 
 Dressen sure knows how to write family dynamic and everything between Sydney, her mom and Peyton was fascinating. I sympathised with Sydney, at times I hated her mom, hated Peyton, but then Dressen does a great job of addressing that things are not always black and white. Why was Sydney's mom always defending Peyton? What did Peyton deserve? What did his victim deserve? There were times I was so frustrated with Sydney's mom, why couldn't she see how great Sydney was? I felt frustrated on Sydney's behalf, which was the only thing I didn't really enjoy about this novel. Her mom's restrictions seemed to go on too long and I ended up feeling really bad for Sydney and wanted her to stand up for herself more often. 
 I also thought Ames was well written as I was actually cringing and completely creeped out by him. It definitely gave me flashbacks from my own teenage years, as I was tall and looked older than I actually was, which did cause me some grief similar to what Sydney feels. That tense feeling I got whenever Ames came around, the ignorance of her parents to how he made her feel, and any scene that lead to Ames being alone with Sydney made me very uncomfortable. 
 Layla was also a great secondary character and the Chatham's background story was almost just as fascinating as Sydney's was. I think Mac is one of the best male love interest that Dressen has written about (Hmm..perhaps other than Owen but I haven't read Just Listen since 2011). She can really make dialogue realistic between teenagers and take everyday conversations (even between friends and family) and make them enjoyable to read, even if they seem mundane. 
 I think this book is one that I could recommend to almost anyone, like most Dressen books it was pleasant and easy to read and came with the happy ending we all wanted. I still have quite a few more Dressen books to read but at this point it is on top and on par with Just Listen.

4,GREAT story! Review to come
5,"It's been a while since I read a King novel. There was a time where I read them the minute they came out, and didn't take a break until I was done. Then something happened. It might be related to the length of some of his works, and the fact that my reading time was cut into dramatically by, well, life. Although I liked the premises of novels like Lisey's Story and Duma Key, I would pass them over in favor of other reading material, and a large part of that was because of the size of some of these novels, and the time investment they would entail. 
 But I latched onto this one shortly after I acquired it, and I'm glad I read it. I never thought of myself as a fan of alternate histories, but this book worked for me. Part of it is that I've always been sort of interested in the Kennedy assassination (I own Case Closed and a few conspiracy theory books), and the idea that someone could go back in time to change things appealed to me. 
 But what I found as I read this book is that the parts concerning Oswald and Jake/George's interaction with him were not the parts that kept me coming back - it was the story that took place in Jodie, Texas, and the characters I met there. Yeah, it was fun to meet up with Richie and Bev in Derry, shortly after the events from the first part of It. Yeah, it was interesting to view Lisbon Falls through two lenses, side by side almost. But George's relationship with Sadie was the part of this book that worked for me, and in a powerful way. 
 We all know King can tell a story like few of his contemporaries (or like anyone, perhaps). This story doesn't disappoint. At times it was overly wordy. There was some stuff that I felt could have been left out, that didn't interest me...mostly about Oswald and the neighborhoods in the DFW area. Some of that stuff I skimmed a little, I admit. But I didn't skim the pages that told of George's interactions with Sadie, or Mike and Bobbi Jill, or Deke and Mimi. That was where this story shined, and without it, this could have been a run of the mill story. 
 With it, I think it stands with some of King's best works. Just my opinion, but I'm sticking with it."
3,"Finally, a romance about a scholar! 
 Well, two scholars, which really just makes it better. At least for the most part. Well. Okay, this book had some issues but I was still happy to see the intellectual types as the main characters. 
 Bella's father traveled the world studying ancient artifacts until passing away and leaving her and her younger siblings a cottage in Oxford with little money to get by. Because of this, Bella jumps on the chance to take a position with the beastly Duke of Aylwin, Miles, who is the son of a former colleague of her father's. Connections, y'all. 
 Anyway, you can probably see how this is going to go. They end up in his house together, working side by side, she brings out his gentler side as the beauty to his beast, cue happily ever after. Oh, and throw in the hunt for a treasure map for good measure. 
 Where this book took a turn for the worst is the way Miles treats Bella on several occasions. He is truly beastly, forcing himself on her both knowingly and also in situations where he's supposed to be so caught up in his work that holding a woman's leg well above her skirts doesn't phase him (despite distressing Bella and also in that time period, simply not appropriate). Time and again he's just a jerk to Bella and everyone around him which didn't endear him to me at all. 
 Now I am glad that Bella was a strong character on her own and put him in his place several times over but I never quite got the attraction between them after the way he acted. I know it's a retelling and a romance so there's going to be a happy ending but I guess I wanted Miles to be less of a beast in the crossing lines/verbally abusive way because it really wasn't necessary. If Disney can manage it, so could this story. 
 And yet. . . I did enjoy this book to a degree. I loved the concept of the two of them examining ancient Egyptian artifacts because it made the book stand out, and the rest of the story was entertaining. There was a bit of mystery that wasn't terribly hard to figure out but did up the tension a bit. Bella and Miles had plenty of heat too so for that side of things, they were covered. My issues centered around the way Miles acted and the romance that ensued despite his behavior. 
 I'll say that I'm definitely interested to read the other books in this series, especially as there seems to be a central character who plans out each of these pairings and has an interesting backstory of her own. This one wasn't a winner for me due to the problems mentioned but the writing was good and I look forward to seeing what other fairy tales Drake tackles in the rest of the series."
5,This was a cute and fun read!
4,4/5. Read for the National Post's Afterword Reading Society.

2,"T H I N G S I D I D N ' T L I K E: 
 - the main character with speshial powers she never knew about cliche 
 - the falling for mr. tall, dark, and handsome even though everyone knows i shouldn't cliche 
 - the childhood best friend/lover trope 
 - the love triangle 
 - cultural inaccuracies {aka the cheap i'm going to make the names sound kinda like this language and mention a couple cultural elements a bunch of times so this setting is unique and diverse! *rubs hands and laughs at cleverness*device}< 
 T H O U G H T S: 
 i'm getting really tired of light fantasy novels reusing the same tropes, cliches, plots, and characters under different banners {insert new culture, fantasy species, time period, yada yada here} without complexity or depth. the reason i love dark, gritty stories is because they probe, they risk, they are raw and evocative to drag you to places inside your mind you didn't want to go before. they make you think. all i could think about in this over-hyped, superficial, lite fantasy is how many more chapters will begin with alina waking up. #sorrynotsorry to say it, but the protagonist is weak, the writing style is amateurish, the plot is predictable, the world-building was basic, and the overuse of tropes and cliches overwhelms whatever bonus points an 'exotic' setting may have factored in. as always: breathtaking cover, promising concept, disappointing execution.

2,"Shadow and Bone was not something I expected to be astounding, but I had hopes that it would be entertaining and fun. Unfortunately, in addition to being conventional and too reliant upon tropes, it's also quite bland. Bardugo doesn't properly develop the world she's attempted to create, and getting an idea of its politics, structure, and society is a challenge. Additionally, there's nothing intriguing about the characters. It's difficult to get a sense of their personalities because they're too caught up in discussing shallow, boring things that add nothing to them as characters or to the fantasy world. Shadow and Bone is simply one of the many YA fantasies out there, and a mediocre one at that. Here's hoping Bardugo's Six of Crows is better."
3,"Interesting premise, storyline, and view into another culture, although the dialogue is often wooden. This could have been an interesting addition to a feminist or trans reading list, but it tends towards the two-dimensional (the characters are generally either good or bad). You can find better."
4,"30000000% agree with the reviewer who said they got about to page 84 and wanted to put the book down and not finish, because I was totally there. And yes, I also agree with the reviewers who note that Kendrick comes off occasionally like it's such a PAIN to be famous, such a PAIN to be dressed up and act. 
 But I powered through and I actually found her pretty honest, quirky, and endearingly weird. 
 Plus, she describes what to me sounds like the all time most perfect Thanksgiving dinner ever, so Anna, if on the off chance you're reading this and want to have a fellow Harry Potter lover over for Thanksgiving, I will show up with wine and nutella and something I didn't bake."
4,"When my request for The Here and Now got approved, I was over the moon. I loved the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants series, and I had read a couple of Ann Brashares standalones too. I was a little apprehensive going into this book, because I'm not super into Sci-Fi or time travel. But I'm really glad that I let my trust in the author lead me to read this book. It was awesome! 
 While this book's premise is based on time-travel, it truly didn't feel very science fiction-y to me. Like other YA contemporary books, this one sucks you into a love story. Prenna and Ethan's relationship is so sweet, first as friends, and then later hoping for something more. Prenna knows that it could be dangerous to his health if they were together, but she can't help it. She's determined to remain friends with him despite any fantasies she might have. When she finds out that the leaders of time-traveler community haven't been doing anything except lying to them, she's determined to disregard their rules and change the future. With Ethan's help, will Prenna be able to prevent pandemic that rips the country to shreds? 
 Brashares writing does an excellent job of sucking you into this story through Prenna and Ethan's forbidden love, her characterization of Prenna, and a thrilling adventure to change the future. I loved watching Prenna go from the quite girl with suspicions to a kick ass rebel and then to a leader who understands sacrifice. 
 Like I said, the sci-fi element in this book wasn't completely in your face. It brought up a lot of good questions about the future we are creating for ourselves. The dystopian world that Prenna comes from sheds light on how much damage humans are doing to the world. However, it turns out that it's not just climate change to blame for the pandemic in Prenna's time. 
 One thing I will be nit picky about is that the whole time travel aspect of this book did bring up some intense questions for me... it just got a little complicated with different time-travelers from different time periods and the documents they brought with them and such. It makes you think what will happen when Prenna dies... will she be born again in a different future. Bah, it just started to make my head hurt. There were a lot of circular questions that could be asked especially concerning the end of the book. But that's a good thing! Books should make you think about things you haven't really considered. 
 Bottom Line: An excellent forbidden love story with a compelling plot. It's becomes very quick paced and sucks you in. Plus the future where Prenna comes from makes you question the choices we, as humans, make now. I would recommend this book to those who enjoy contemporary YA as well as those who like to think about all the what-ifs of time travel. But, you don't have to be a Sci-Fi nut to love this book."
2,why did I pick this up? idk
4,"Actual rating: 3.8 
 This review is quite late. I read this many months ago already, but only got to re-read it recently. 
 This is a debut mystery novel, and it shows. Oh, I loved the characters well enough. Kiera(?) has a unique backstory, and she's a widow. Sebastian Gage has quite generic rake qualities but still comes off as loveable. They both grow their trust (and luuurve) in the story, and I loved that. I love things taking time (though just four days or so) for that to happen, yet still have enough impact and realism I guess. I also love that we get a good mystery (predictable, yes, but entertaining enough). I loooove that this was based on Scotland and the MC is more of Scottish. It's not a place I often read about, but I know it is alluring and fantastic. 
 Now, on to what I didn't like so much...I guess I didn't like how Kiera pretty much sensibly infers what happened in the end? I guess it was too much of an info dump for me, and it could have been handled well differently. Also it would have been nice if there were more of a discussion rather than like an...inquisition (although that of course is the point, I guess, but well...) 
 And then the end. Like...that was quite weird and awkward and I guess it would have been nicer if (view spoiler)[ Gage threw a joke. Or at least did something more. (hide spoiler)] 
 I wasn't too satisfied with how some stuff in this book went by, but I am colored intrigue. So I read the second book right away last year too (which I'll still have to review soon~). ^^"
4,"Why not 5 stars? Actually I was thinking 3.4 because I really dislike books where everything is so different you end up spend half the time trying to keep up with what amounts almost to a new language. That is my huge bug-bear for this book. Everything has weird names, from the characters to the lands to the species (yes, plural), the forms of government, titles, even body parts. It dissolved a lot of the pleasure for me. The romance in this book is very much like skimming cream-off-the-top-of-milk, barely there and lacking in everything - intensity, passion, obsession, focus, desire...need I go on? The story: Dragons and humans have lived peacefully for nearly half a century. Seraphina was brought up by her Uncle (her father remarried and has a new family). She has imaginary friends - well, an imaginary garden populated by people she has to keep in line - who give her debilitating headaches. She has just secured a position as assistant to the royal musician. The princess, one of her pupils, quickly becomes a friend as does the bastard prince (who also heads the Queen's guards) when there is an assassination that could threaten the peace treaty. But there is more to Seraphina than meets the eye and while she and her friends try to unravel the mystery behind the murder she does everything in her power to keep her secret intact. If you're a fan of fantasy worlds (like Terry Pratchett's Discworld) then this might appeal to you. For myself I am wondering why I didn't give up halfway through - and that is why I gave it so many stars because it did manage to keep my attention. 
 Addendum: I am now looking for other novels featuring dragons so this book has met a critical directive: create enthusiasm. Move over angels, dragons have flown in!"

 4.5 stars 
 This book beautifully intertwines 4 topics (photography, baseball, dementia and first loves) into a relatable teenage story. Peter's voice rings true throughout the book and is the type of protagonist I like to see in books- real. Peter is a little bit of a nerd, a little bit of a sports nut, a little bit of a photographer, and a little bit of a family guy, but he finds out through his freshman year how to survive without something he always thought he'd have in his life and find a passion in something else. One thing I liked that Sonnenblick tied in was the idea that Peter can deceive his conscious self and others as much as he wants, but through his dreams his subconscious shows what our true emotions are. Another highlight for me was the ""The Decisive Moment"" which was a phrase coined by French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson which is a photograph that speaks the truth. It is stolen, taken on the run and decisive. This idea becomes a major theme throughout the book and almost Peter's montra.

4,"The agricultural revolution left farmers with lives generally more difficult and less satisfying than those of forgers, Hunter-gatherers spent their time in more stimulating and varied ways and were less in danger of starvation and disease. The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, buy the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather it translated into population explosion and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history's biggest fraud 
 Who was responsible. Neither kings, nor priests, nor merchants. The culprits were a handful of plant species, including wheat, rice and potatoes ..... 
 Ten thousand years ago wheat was just a wild grass, one of many, confined to a small range in the Middle East. Suddenly, within just a few short millennia, it was growing all over the world ......... 
 Wheat did it by manipulating Homo Sapiens to its advantage ........ 
 Wheat didn't like rocks and pebbles, so Sapiens broke their backs clearing fields. Wheat didn't like sharing its space, water and nutrients with other plants, so men and women laboured long days weeding under the scorching sun ... Wheat was thirsty, so humans dug irrigation channels .... 
 Moreover the new agricultural tasks demanded to much time that people were forced to settle permanently next to their wheat fields .... 
 We did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us 
 Wikipedia serves as an excellent summary of the book's main thesis (and sub-theses) 
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens... 
 Overall an extremely stimulating book. 
 In many ways it resembles Jared Diamond's wonderful Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies in its historical sweep and bold statements, however it is far less detailed and exhaustive in its evidence than that book. This is both a strength and a weakness - it means that the book covers far more ground and is more readable, but it also means that at time it can come across as superficial and (very unusually for a non-fiction book) the reader is sometimes left wanting more (not less) detail and for the author to spend more time on a topic before moving on to the next topic."
4,"This review is rather long I'm afraid. And full of matcha. I apologize in advance. 
 I am not a big fan of matcha (green tea). No matter how hype it is, I just don't like it. I can still eat it if I have to but I know for certain I will not enjoy it. 
 Imagine there's this new kind of matcha ice cream in town. It's hype. It's the 'it' of all matcha. It isn't served on a bowl or cup or cone. No. It comes in a cloudy bubbly floating cotton candy, wrapped with bows, blasting funky music as it passes. It's matcha, I tell myself. Just because it's dressed up differently doesn't make it non-matcha. I shouldn't try it, right? 
 Of course I tried it. 
 I'm weak. I'm easily swayed by propaganda and funky thing. 
 After all the fanfare and the exploding candies die in my mouth, all I have left is matcha. And in that moment, I literally said, "" Oh. It's you. Matcha."" 
 Illuminae is like matcha to me because Sci Fi in general is my matcha. I don't hate Illuminae. I like it okay but not enough to make me love it. 
 It is an interesting read, but not close to mind-blowing. Some parts are creepy and emotional, strangely I didn't feel 'the feels.' My emotions are perfectly intact, not stirred, not a mess. I expected to be shaken, but nuuuhh. I blame the format for making me unable to feel the feels. The flowing and twirling words are too troublesome for me to read, so I mostly skip them. 
 On the other hand, I laugh several times. Illuminae is quite funny. It has a badass heroine (double bonus) and a very adorable, inappropriate, romantic male lead (triple bonus). In summary, this book is all together awesome though it feels rather flat at the end despite its major twist(s). 
 I know what you would say. ""So you will stay away from matcha ... er Illuminae next time?"" 
 Why would I stay away? If Illuminae sequel comes out, I'll definitely buy it. 
 Don't try to analyze me. 
 Nearly 4 stars."

5,"Still, the longer I was around her, the more I could see the colors of her mind and the recesses of her heart. There was a beast in there. But there was also a girl who was afraid of being a beast. 
 Sometimes I come across a book that leaves me breathless. This is one of them. Let me tell you from the start. The only thing fun and fluffy about Peter Pan is the Disney film. The original story and this story are both dark. But I personally believe this book by Jodi Lynn Anderson is much darker. The entire novel is an emotional roller coaster ride. It touches upon growing up, change, as well as colonialism. Tiger Lily is not like most girls. People either want her to be more girly, or less brave, or follow the norms. Everyone in the village tip toes around her thinking she may be dangerous. In fact, there are only exactly three people in this book who love her for who she is. This shows how alone and isolated she feels. 
 She is expected to marry an abusive boy from her village due to a promise her guardian, Tik Tok, made long ago when he found her abandoned under a tree as a baby. But while engaged with said boy, she secretly befriends Peter Pan and the lost boys and slowly starts falling in love with him. The romance between Peter and Tiger Lily is cheesy, but not cheesy in a bad way. You realize they both find the other really intriguing and eventually they both are in love. Of course there are disruptions to their relationship, such as the new Englander that randomly shows up and tries to change their ways of live as well as their beliefs. But the worst part is that the village gives into him, thinking he must be smart and starts taking his instructions. An almost similar thing happens with Peter Pan and the lost boys when Wendy shows up. They've been living on their own in the trees and woods and it is not very often when a girl from a far away place such as England shows up. She eventually starts telling them how to decorate their home and how they should change a few things. And they all comply thinking how smart and knowledgeable she is as if they would not have thought of the same thing themselves. 
 I've heard a lot of people say they refuse to read this book because to them, Peter is supposed to belong to Wendy. But I find those statements completely absurd. This is not the Disney film you grew up watching. In fact, this is a story you have never heard before. I also completely disagree with the comments stating how they're angry with how this book makes Peter Pan seem like the bad guy. I don't think he is the bad guy from any angle. 
 The thing about Peter in this book is that he finds everything mesmerizing, literally everything. And that is both a good and a bad quality to have. He was mesmerized by Tiger Lily and fell in love. He is mesmerized by the mermaids which are supposed to be dangerous creatures. But the minute Tiger Lily's guardian becomes sick and she had to stop visiting him for a while, he and the other lost boys are already engrossed by another girl who happens to be Wendy. Wendy is not such a likable character in this story. But she is not a bad person. In fact she is never once rude. What makes her unlikable is how easily the lost boys fell under her spell, and how easily she made Peter Pan fall under her spell. But Peter Pan also has a personality that makes Wendy fall under his spell the same way he made Tiger Lily. 
 You can see from the start that Peter may love Tiger Lily, but he does not love her for who she is. He wants her to be brave, but only as long as she is not braver than him. Even after Wendy shows up, you can tell Peter still loves and thinks about her. But the problem with Peter is that I don't think he knows how to love properly. Though all the lost boy's love and respect him, he is still broken. He carries the weight of all the fear on his shoulders so the rest of them do not have to. He acts happy on the outside to portray to his family that everything is okay. That kind of love is what makes him a hero. 
 To most people, the happiest moments in this story are the moments between Tiger Lily and Peter Pan. I agree those are happy moments, but to me, the happiest moment was the ending when everything wrapped up. There is not a single thing about the ending that I would want to be changed. I believe it was meant to end the way it did. But what matters most is that both our beloved characters are where they are supposed to be. 
 It is also pretty obvious that this story reminds people of the settlement in North America. The Englanders coming into their home and trying to change things to make themselves comfortable is pretty relatable to what happened years ago with the Native Americans. The whole ordeal with Tik Tok was the hardest part for me. His situation was traumatizing and morbid to me. Morbid to extent that I now have dried tears on a certain page. 
 I think the reason why this book was so well executed was because it was told from the perspective of Tinker Bell. She is merely a bug who flies around Tiger Lily analyzing everything she does. And she is also one of the three people who loved her completely for what she is. But to know who the other two are, you'd need to read the book. 
 I am glad the first 2017 book I finished was a 5 star one. Starting the year with a bang!"
3,"The possibility that the main character is a serial killer is awesome because the main character is a female. I know the statistics, but it's still nice to see a female serial killer. Or possible serial killer. 
 Overall, Killer Instinct was an entertaining read. Some of the things Lane does instead of killing are awesome. I love what she did with that drunk driver. Her slut-shaming though is pretty severe which is hard to take. And though she has problems caring about people on a regular basis (I get that), when push comes to shove, she does actually care. 
 The writing style felt a little strange for me, which may just have been the author trying to write a character with no emotions. I feel that something didn't mesh right. There were also two scenes, both of the same nature, that just felt out of place. 
 I was definitely surprised by who the killer was, and I still think there were a couple of people who were definitely up to something and we're just never told about it. As surprising as that ending was, the way everything was resolved, and the way it actually ended, it just left me completely unsatisfied."
4,"Great read. Why has it taken me so long to read this series? And why did I keep setting it aside? Who knows, but I'm sure glad that I finally did. I think for once it was great for me to read something paranormal that didn't have to do with vampires or werewovles. The history and story line was a nice breath of fresh air. Every aspect of the novel kept me wanting more. Although one question was answered, another one would arise. For the first time in awhile some parts gave me goosebumps and that ""GASP"" when something crazily unexpected happened. And Nash, oh Nash why are you so perfect? The fact that Kaylee and him didn't even have to touch they sent chills up my spine. It was a type of sexy that can't even be explained. 
 Yum. 
 :)"
5,"When the murderer of Alex Craft's sister walked free, she made sure he wouldn't get off scot-free. She knows how to kill a man. She doesn't get caught, but she knows she can't trust herself around other people even in her small Ohio hometown. She tries to become invisible and go unnoticed, just make it through the rest of the school year. However, Jack does just that - he's the guy everyone wants to be, or be with, as the future valedictorian and a football star - he hasn't been able to forget her considering his role in her sister's death years ago. He doesn't just notice her, he wants to really get to know her. Peekay, the Preacher's Kid whose identity is wrapped up in her father's profession, does too as both girls volunteer at the local animal shelter. The two slowly become friends and Peekay begins to see that Alex is much more than she would have expected. Over the course of senior year, Alex, Peekay, and Jack begin to come together, and only one thing is for certain, they will not come out the same. 
 Mindy McGinnis's newest release, The Female of the Species can be best described as dark, gritty, chilling, brutal, and intense. The author doesn't pull any punches with this absolutely enthralling tale. Her prose is captivating and her character development is top notch. The Female of the Species is a must read YA Contemporary. I don't say that often about contemporaries, but this one certainly earns it in every way. It addresses tough subjects including drinking, sex, and drugs. However, it most prominently features an unflinching look at rape culture, double standards, and abuse - it holds a mirror up to the worst parts of our society. I'd say it pushes the envelop more than any YA novel I've read, especially one that's lead by a female character. It's surprising and refreshing to see how much Alex gets away with or takes in and how much that is actually addressed. 
 On a similar topic, and as I mentioned above, the character development here is excellent, especially when it comes to Alex. She is absolutely filled with rage for what has happened to her sister, along with other horrible things that she witnesses over the course of the novel some of which have been practically normalized, and shes uses that rage to claim justice. However, she isn't confined to just being a rage filled psychopath or sociopath, she's much more and can't be boxed in or labelled. She fearless, not afraid to call people out, protective of her friends (and cute shelter animals), and willing to do what it takes to get a job done. The novel alternates between point-of-view chapters of Alex and her friends, Jack and Peekay, which does cut down on some of the near nonstop intensity, but does give us a great look at Alex through their eyes. Like I mentioned before, all of the characters are really well developed including the secondary and supporting cast. and we get fascinating views into their lives and just how much Alex has influenced them for better or for worse. 
 Overall, The Female of the Species by Mindy McGinnis is an incredibly important novel that must not be missed. I highly recommend all of her novels, but this one in particular needs to be read - but be forewarned that, depending on the maturity of the reader, is meant for older teens ages 16 and up. McGinnis expertly handles difficult topics that are often just not discussed openly at all. If you're interested in the character of Lisbeth Salander from The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson, I believe you'll also want to meet Alex Craft. It's easy to see why Mindy McGinnis has quickly become one of my favorite YA authors and I am eagerly awaiting her next book, Given to the Sea, which is due out on April 11, 2017."
3,"Errr, what kind of ending was that?"
4,"Kids still like an old-fashioned yarn. 
 I was tempted to not take this one out to the elementary schools on my pre-summer reading program visits this year. It's much thicker than I usually shoot for, and it's already getting attention since it won a bunch of honors during book award season. 
 But the kids really responded to this bright cover and old-fashioned story. 
 Mo lives in a tiny town in the south. She and her parents (nontraditional though they might be) run the local diner where everyone in their community comes to gossip. So, when a murder is committed, Mo is one of the few people in town who knows the characters and circumstances behind the murder. 
 Personally, as a long-time mystery lover, I found this truly engaging and fun to read. I also really enjoyed hearing about how the diner worked (realistic or not though that might be). I was much more interested in Mo's relationships with her adoptive parents than her interest in her biological mother, but that may be my own special fascination. 
 A great choice if you enjoy interesting vocabulary, regional culture, hilarious and unique characters, and setting-rich mysteries."
2,"Very disappointing, as I really enjoyed all the other books I've read in this series ( 
 Boneshaker, 
 Dreadnought 
 and Ganymede. By comparison, this one was a little dull, and read kind of like a Boys' Own Advenure story than a fully-realized contribution to the Clockwork Century universe. ""See these quick-witted lads capture a sasquatch, and solve the mystery of the hole in the wall!"" The characters weren't as compelling as in the other novels (despite the fact that all the previous protagonists appear in this one), and the story itself was a little hackneyed and dull. The city has lost a lot of its menace without the rotters, and it doesn't seem as mysterious as it did in Boneshaker. Just a very disappointing addition to the series. I will probably read 
 Fiddlehead 
 at some point to see how she wraps it all up, but I could have done without this entry."
5,"Gorgeous. Short but intricate - with the plaudits. And despite all the voices never repeating once, they aren't silenced."
4,"This was not the book I expected to read going in. I picked this up since it was heavily recommended after I finished What We Saw and I expected to feel a similar rage for the main character in this one. But rage wasn't what I felt, despite the title. It was more of a heart/gut ache over how broken she was and how much she was struggling every day. 
 It is a scary thing to tell the truth and not be believed. It is also scary how willing we are to turn a blind eye to someone being in that place if it means that we can avoid seeing that someone we know could break someone else so thoroughly with their actions. 
 Throughout the book we see the nastiest parts of small town life and high school politics, especially the ones between the girls. It's nasty and left me with a real icky feeling. The characters were honest and flawed and horrible, and that's where this book stands apart from other teen issue books. The reactions were real and not everyone reacted the way you'd want them to, but that just lends honesty to them. 
 The reason I'm knocking this down a star is because I found the timeline a little too jumpy and while I can understand that's partly because we're living inside Romy's head and she is understandably messed up, it did take away from the narrative for me."
4,"Very short. Read after book 9 which had alluded to Dean and Quentin. I'm sort of surprised since I didn't know that Quentin was (view spoiler)[ interested romantically with men as well as women. (hide spoiler)] I find this an interesting plot development what with him being who he is. 
 Anyways this book centers around Quentin's parents coming to town, but they suddenly want to take him home for some reason. I like the interactions and getting to know Quentin's way of thinking. Apparently back then he didn't really like Tybalt for Toby either. All this is great in telling us his thoughts. I love it, seeing Toby through someone else's eyes."
2,"It's kind of a cross between the films Halloween and Children of the corn - but for kids! 
 I give it one star for the amount of enjoyment I got from the book, but it wasn't badly written, so I'm giving it 2 stars."
4,I liked that the protagonist and I put the final pieces together at about the same time.
0,"Film adaptation in the works:

3,"Eh, just middling. it wasn't really going anywhere, just something to pass lunch time and cab rides with."
5,"I saw the movie first, so this might be a little different. The tale begins with a young Dunstan Thorn, but we are not with him for long, instead we move on to Dunstan's son, Tristan, who has always believed that his father's wife was his mother. Perhaps if his father had told him that his mother was from across the wall, Tristan might have realized earlier what he was getting himself into. One of the biggest changes that stood out to me was the varied emphasis on side characters many great ones from the book are omitted from the movie where as the relatively small part of the captain is made huge. I think I love the dead brothers even more in the book, which is saying something and the significance of their names stands out even more including mother, Una. So anyway we follow Tristan on his journey for true love, the results are just not what he imagined they would be. If you have seen the movie, when you read the book you should realize that Gaiman can do brilliant things, but they just aren't Hollywood. The ending in particular is absolutely bloody fabulous, but people would have left a movie theater groaning... I guess that is life."
3,"I loved hearing about the oldest Kelly brother. I loved the big family first atmosphere. The banter was classic and the love story was nice. This book is full of sex, danger, angst, trust issues, health issues, and bullets. Can't wait to get to the next book to find out Garrett's story. 
 Story - 3.25 
 Narrator - 3"
3,I liked it. Some things I predicted. A lot were surprises! It was weird and kind of not what I was expecting. As the synopsis states it is a game. The whole thing kind of reminded me of a murder mystery party game.
4,"Now know why this is such a popular series, it is addictive reading because once you start you want to keep going until finished!"
3,"I have really enjoyed the series thus far. But this is by far my least favorite book in this series. I wish the author had just told us it was 90% sex scenes, 5% mystery, and 5% unresolved plot lines so I could have skipped this one and moved on the the next book in the series. I don't feel that we learned anything new about the characters or the story line in general so skipping it wouldn't have mattered a bit. Huge disappointment. :-("
3,This book is actually very good but it is disturbing.
4,"""A"" is a 16-year-old who, for as long as he/she (doesn't identify with one gender or another) can remember, has woken in the body of a different person each day. The person whose body A inhabits for a 24-hour period is always the same general age and lives in a geographic area of about a 100 mile radius, but other than those parameters, A might wake up as a male, female, gay, straight, Asian, Latino, Caucasian, Black, in a myriad of functional and dysfunctional family situations. A has gotten used to the lack of connectivity with others that this allows-- until s/he meets Rhiannon. When s/he inhabits the body of Rhiannon's loser boyfriend Justin for a day, s/he is smitten, and can't get her out of his/her head or heart. As A inhabits other teens, s/he keeps finding excuses to meet Rhiannon again, until finally s/he tells Rhiannon his/her secret. At first, Rhiannon doesn't believe it, but she is convinced over time and must then come to terms with whether she can love someone strictly for what's on the inside, when the outside changes every day. 
 Levithan does a marvelous job with the voices of his characters (including the varied ones whom A becomes for a day), and with the thought-provoking situations that arise as A moves from one body to another. When one of the teens, Nathan, realizes that he has been ""inhabited"" and claims that Satan possessed his body, it quickly makes the news, and a preacher who is overly interested in Nathan's story turns out to play an important part in the decisions that A and Rhiannon ultimately reach."
4,"4 Teacups / 5 Handcuffs 
 Rene's Thoughts: 
 * It was so fun to be back with the Raven Riders again! They are a great group of guys, who actively help those who can not help themselves. These are men you want to know and have in your life. They are also all hot, have hot bikes and even hotter tattoos! 
 * You do not need to have read the first novel in the series to enjoy this one. Several characters from the previous make an appearance, but their relationships are full explained and do not distract from the story. 
 * One of the narrative elements I enjoyed the most, was that both Alexa and Maverick were responsible for their past relationship falling apart. During the course of the novel they realize how wrong they had both been! 
 * Alexa and Maverick have some amazing chemistry! They really are perfectly matched, and not just in the bedroom. Their history also enables them to understand each other, even more deeply. 
 * I love how Alexa grows as a character throughout the novel. You see her gradually change, and become her true-self. Someone who realizes what a great guy Maverick is and has always been! 
 * Maverick is one of the good guys, he's hard-working, caring, kind and protective of the ones he loves. He realizes that he's as much at fault for what happened in the past, as Alexa is, and moves past blaming her. 
 * The Raven Riders mission may be all about helping those who can not help themselves, but all of these heroines prove that they are strong enough to protect themselves! It's one of the many things I love about this series! 
 * I can't wait for the next installment, Ride Wild, and to finally see Sam smile again!

5,"So. Freaking. Good. I loved the first one. It was my favorite book I read last year. Somehow this book was even better. If you like Hunger Games or Game of Thrones, I cannot recommend this book enough. I was on the edge of my seat in the best of ways. I felt the characters were already super fleshed out to begin with and they got pushed to new heights. The author tackles some huge subjects: religion, war, death, family, homosexuality, female empowerment. But it's so thoughtful and provoking in a way that doesn't push an agenda. This saga is completely underrated and much better written than many of the hyped up YAs."
5,"This is probably one of the best, most well written books I have ever read. 
 It's a mind stretcher because it's not about a star crossed romance and it's not about a mysterious circus with caramel apples. It's about life and loss and what makes experiences a dream? A reality? And if there's even a different. 
 I recommend this book to everyone ready to challenge themselves and challenge their imaginations. This book really serves to take you elsewhere but it's all up to you whether you board the train or not."
4,"3 1/2 stars 
 The author has credited me with having a more retentive memory than I actually possess. Almost all of her characters were introduced in the first few pages, via a letter that Miss Dido Kent was writing to her sister. I continually had to reread the first chapter because I could not remember who was who, nor what their role was in the household. I was more than halfway through the book before I could finally keep everyone straight in my mind. 
 I'll look for the next book in this series. I very much enjoyed both the author's writing style, and the fact that this series is set during the Regency period. 
 UPDATE: This book was previously published as A Moment of Silence

4,"3.5-4 /5. It feels like an interesting start to what could be a brilliant story. I can't wait to get into it more. 
 Maybe it's me still not used to comics, but I found this one's layout to be a little too much for my eyes at times. Maybe it was the mixture of the aquarelle type of drawing, the predominant white in certain pages I didn't like so much, and the fact that there was a lot of info, visual and verbal, on every single page. 
 But I think all of that is a matter of taste so shouldn't be regarded with too much weight."
4,"Starters is a really good dystopia that would make a good choice for next year's Gateway Readers Award list. 
 The biological war that has always been threatened has finally happened. The government knew it was coming so they vaccinated its citizens - but only had enough to give to the young and the old. The Spore War killed everyone between the ages of 20 and 60. This leaves the parentless young homeless and poverty stricken while the old are safe, comfy, and rich. The old don't have everything, though. They long for their youth. Lucky for them, a company called Prime Destinations is here to help them. For a fee (a very large fee), old people can ""borrow"" a teen's body for a while. Teens are willing to donate their bodies because they're so desperate for money. Callie is one of these teens. She's squatting in an abandoned building with her best friend (potential love interest?) Michael and sweet, little brother Tyler. Callie wakes up in the body of her renter, rich beyond her wildest dreams. She's living in a mansion, driving awesome cars, and dating the senator's son. She's thrilled to be living this fairy tale life until she find out her renter has more than having fun in mind when she rented Callie's body. She also learns that Prime Destinations is not the company it claims to be. 
 Excellent first book in just a two book series. Quick, fast-paced read. Give to those who liked Delirium (or any dystopia, really)."
5,"Wooo boy! This was a wild ride from start to finish. Normally I'm fairly good at predicting bombshells before they're presented, but this time I had to drop my jaw a little bit more at each reveal. The last twist officially made me open my mouth wide and reread a paragraph three times - no joke. I cannot wait to see this translated to the screen because I feel like the story is different and compelling. You want to root for both sides and then suddenly you're like: wow, NOPE. NOPE TO THE BOTH OF YOU."
4,"I gave this classic four stars- not to mean that I really liked it, but rather that I really respected it. I managed to avoid this book in school, but broke down and finally decided to read it at the ripe old age of....well, never you mind that. It did take me a few pages to get in the groove of 1950's British schoolboy-speak, but it didn't take me long to get fully absorbed. And horrified. Even having a general idea of what was coming, I found myself cringing as I read- often times forcing myself to continue reading as most of the characters succumbed to their baser instincts and the mob mentality that spread like the wildfire over the island- literally at times. I mourned the dark self-knowledge that was forced upon the intially naive boys, and grieved for the characters that met such tragic ends. 
 ***Slight spoiler*** I felt that the ending was brilliant. When I began the book, that was the ""happy"" ending that I was hoping for, and yet knowing that the boys might have been physically saved, but were emotionally lost was cruel and entirely fitting with respect to the tone of the book."
5,"This was the first Michelle Zink book I discovered that I really wanted to read (along the way I discovered her other series as well). It sounded so interesting and right up my alley and, let me tell you, it did not disappoint. 
 After sixteen year old Helen Cartwright loses her parents, she's forced to intrust her safety to two brother's she's never met before. Soon she's discovering the existence of the Dictata and her place in world she didn't anything about. 
 Though she's been trained for path, nothing could have prepared her for finding the one person she never expected to see again. Will Helen be able to set things right and follow her heart? 
 I absolutely love Michelle's writing. There's just something so fluid about it that just makes me want to keep reading it. And before I'd even gotten a chance to read any of her work I (and my sister) got to meet her at a Teen Book Con back in March. Just hearing talk about her books, the legends she used, and the research she did only made me want to dig in more. 
 One of the things that I really enjoyed in this story was Helen's feistiness. There wasn't a clear time-frame for when it was set, but clearly it was during a time of corsets and propriety and you all know how much I love me some historical fiction. So, to have a female character in such a time period ready and willing to fight back was refreshing. She was a lady and was treated as one, but she also didn't allow the two brother's (or anyone really) to keep her out of anything. She was touch when she needed to be, yet gentle. 
 The intricate weaving of the story details was also another plus for me. So much takes place, but it isn't an overwhelming since of information. It is presented to the readers a little at a time, only adding to the already intriguing bases. YET, there is still so much that can be left to tell. I for one am crossing my fingers that there will be more. 
 I definitely love this book and can't wait to read more from Michelle, she has ensured that I will keep reading her stuff and I hope you guys will too!"
2,"Well this one took me a while to finish. Stiefvater has a poetic way with words and sets up a wonderful world. Linger was amazing and the new twist on werewolves absolutely brilliant. For a subject that we start to think has run out of new twists or any drastic enough to catch our attention Stiefvater did. The young romance of Grace and Sam was sweet and the whole of their star crossed path had me interested and invested in these characters. And while some were disappointed in the not completely closed ending that didn't bother me to much. My biggest draw back and what kept losing my interest is mostly a personal preference. While Stiefvater has very poetic descriptions, I tend to find long drawn out musings and self analyzing boring no matter how beautifully written. Not that I don't like them in their share, but their has to be a more equal balance for me to stay hooked. That aside I could have gotten past it if more of the big things going on in the book led somewhere. But since we spent so much time on them and it didn't end up having any conclusions or effect on the outcome I felt like it drew out a story for no reason."
5,Just Wow
2,"Girl Parts is based on an interesting idea of having robots teach people how to have healthy relationships, but the world could have been much more developed, and the story more well-written. 
 While the story had elements of future technology, like the three panelled computers and online learning in schools,I felt that the changes in people's lives in the future could have been more significant and imaginative. I was looking forward to seeing the author's vision of the future, but was sorely disappointed. Even the main theme of impact of technology on human relationships did not seem particularly well developed. 
 The opening scene of suicide did not seem related to much of anything that occurs later. The plot did not have much of a climax or resolution. I don't see the purpose of Rose being modified at the chop shop, and even find it insulting that it seems to imply that one is not complete without (view spoiler)[reproductive organs (hide spoiler)]. 
 Overall, a book based on an interesting idea that could have been taken so much further in a world more richly imagined."
4,"Short and sweet review (JUST READ THE DARN BOOK!) you won't be disappointed. 
 The only think I will say is that I never really fell in love with Caleb. I liked him and was rooting for him and Olivia, but 
 (view spoiler)[ his lies were almost as bad as hers (hide spoiler)] He was no better than she was .... 
 However! Even though it was a very very short time we knew him, I absolutely adore (view spoiler)[ Noah (hide spoiler)] 
 I can not wait to devour the rest of this series!"
0,"I finished this a few days ago and forgot to mark it as read. oopsie. So, I thought this one was okay, not great, not awful. a year from now when my review for this pops up on facebook year in review I'm probably not going to remember this book, but it was a pretty easy and quick read."
4,A great conclusion to the trilogy!
5,"4.5 
 Not everything was perfect for me. There were a few small things that didn't click with me, but the rest is just so much fun and so intriguing that this is the most addicting new series for me. Great characters and world building!"

 My expectations for this book were VERY low after reading Passion. However, it did surprise me by being not as awful as I thought it would be. There were parts though, where I wanted to just stop reading, simply because this book gave me a headache with all of its biblical drama. I am glad though, that I read it until the very end. 
 My biggest problem with this novel was that some things were left unanswered. Being the last book in Lauren Kate's series, this book was meant to be the book that resolves all of Luce's (and the reader's) questions. While we learn about Luce's first life, how she and Daniel meet, and what she really is, there are some things that Kate left unanswered. Such as, why did Trevor spontaneously combust when he kissed Luce? Miles didn't, nor did Cam. Luce suspects at some point in the earlier novels that it is because Trevor was not Daniel, but this was not ever confirmed."
0,"Argh, I feel so torn about this, I feel so deeply torn. 
 I mean, I follow Anna Cowan on Twitter and I read her blog, and I kind of completely *adore* her but ... but ... I am not ... I just ... argh. Argh. 
 This doesn't work for me. 
 There's lots I do really like about it. I know ""different"" is not necessarily always a good thing (*cough* Painted Faces *cough*) but, in this case, I think it is. I was so happy to have a sexually ambiguous, cross-dressing hero. I loved the strong, determined, active heroine. And I loved the way the interacted together. I bought the romance between them, utterly. I also liked the fact that there seemed to be different things going on than in most of the Regency-set historicals I've read (heh, all two of them) - I mean, there are balls, yes, but there are also mud and farms and families and impending industrialisation. It's a very marginalisation-conscious book - both Darlington and Kit are marginalised by ... I guess ... gender ambiguity, the family is marginalised by poverty, lots of the characters are marginalised by sexuality. 
 This is all shit hot awesome stuff. 
 Oh, and I liked the focus on the family, as well, and how important they are to each other's lives - even Wet Tom, her hopeless gay brother. 
 Equally, it's incredibly engaging written. The dialogue is all sparky and delightful, and the prose is just plain old fashioned lovely, and often quite unique: 
 And there he was, the man in black. His profile was to her, his fingers as clever over the keys as his tongue was over words. But less ... restrained. His music was lit at the edges. 
 But, wah, but wah, there was also a lot that didn't work for me. I'm not massively bothered about historical veracity: I didn't mind that Kit behaves kind of wildly unacceptably, or that Darlington's crowd of sodomitical dandies behave too much like modern day queers with a sense of identity as themselves a queers, or that dandyism seemed inherently connected, by the text, to homosexuality, or even that - apparently - the Corn Laws are wrong BUT the plot just came across to me as wildly incoherent. It had a lot of quite interesting strands but they never quite came together in a satisfying manner, and occasionally characters just seemed to act for no other reason than to further it - like Darlington semi-randomly deciding to stay with Kit WHILE disguised as a woman or Wet Tom waking up one morning and deciding to sell the farm. There's usually some underlying emotional drive but because there was so much happening, the interplay and evolution of motivation and needs between characters didn't always come across to me. Like, I really liked Lydia and BenRuin (even he was a stereotypical HUGE SCOTT) but they finally decide to have a conversation and admit they care about each other ... because ... uh ... it was near the end of the book, and they felt it was time to have a conclusion? 
 And, although I really admired Cowan's attempt to interrogate gender construction in the romance gender, to me it felt more like a slightly unfortunate re-assignment of traits and tropes, rather than a deconstruction of them. Darlington identifies quite explicitly as unmanly man (and suffers for it, as his father's hands) but ... since his non-manly behaviour seemed to centre around passivity, weakness, fearfulness etc. it just reinforced the notion that masculinity = strength, effeminacy = weakness. Which is, of course, nonsense, as well as being problematic. Also Darlington is revealed to be vulnerable before he's ever really established as being the cunning, complicated exquisite he's supposed to be. So it's like he just walks into the text, is briefly interesting and then starts wobbling like a badly set blancmange. I genuinely don't mind the vulnerable man thing, not in the slightest, I rejoiced and embraced, but I disliked that it was kind of immediate, because that undermined the reality of it, and I disliked the fact it was muddled in with ideas about gender identity and expression. That men aren't SUPPOSED to express vulnerability is a different issue, I think. 
 Again, this is a personal reading, but I felt that the text unintentionally ended up buying into the very ideas it was trying to challenge. 
 Darlington's bisexuality is a bit invisible as well - it's briefly mentioned he bonks men, but since he's also basically frigid (until Kit) I'm not quite sure when he'd have got round to it, or why he'd have bothered. And it just has no impact on, basically, anything, so I don't know why it's even in there, except as further explication of Darlington's perceived unmanliness / difference. I'm sorry to keep banging on about this stuff, but it's, well, it's important to me. 
 This is a slightly odd piece of detail to, uh, pay too much attention to but the first time Kit and Darlington have sex, he basically plays the passive role and, frankly, it's kind of hot, except she learns how to, ah 'enter him' to quote the text and it comes out later that he didn't at any point ... reciprocate. He later does, and that's fine, but I wasn't what was going on here. I guess he didn't want to impregnate / devirginate her, since they weren't married but he's not exactly been the bastion of selflessness so far, and, y'know, by the time you're sharing a room with an unwed lady, and basically having sex with her, not putting your dick in her is kind of quibbling. 
 And, pretty as it was, the whole thing just felt kind of weird to me. I mean even ""unmanly bisexuals"" have a cock they like to put places... and, although I appreciated the gender/role reversal thingy, I felt it unhelpfully underscored ideas about activeness and penetration being masculine and passivity and being penetrated being feminine. 
 Also all the gayboys are totally wet and hopeless. 
 That is all. And I know it sounds like I hated this, but I really didn't. I admired it a lot, it just troubled me a lot too."
3,"Whaaaaaaaaaat! A book can't end like that! It just can't. 
 Well..it obviously did, but still! That is so mean! 
 Anew was an amazing and incredible ride, if you're looking for a paranormal romance novel. 
 I definitely hate love triangles, but in this case it didn't bother me that much. (I know who my baby is...TRISTAAAAAAAAAN) 
 The characters were really interesting, especially of course Tristan, and so adorable. Cough Tristan cough 
 Anyway I think by now you got that Tristan was my favourite character. He is a troubled soul so I couldn't just NOT want to comfort him. 
 Gabriel, Tristan's twin brother, who also happens to be the other end of the love triangle, is great as well. But he wouldn't necessarily come to my mind when it comes to amazing characters. 
 Scarlet, the female protagonist, was really likeable and enjoyable as well. 
 Overall Anew was a fantastic read! So stoked to continue this series."
5,"Find this this review and many others on idobi.com! 
 ""I admit to being a moron at lots of things. Being a moron in one or two areas serves to highlight my extraordinary brilliance in everything else."" 
 Basically: Rachel Watts gets more than she bargained for when she and her eccentric (but sexy) neighbor, James Mycroft, stumble across a murder scene. If BBC's Sherlock was a young adult novel, it would be Ellie Marney's Every Breath. 
 Mix a classic case of the boy-next-door with a strong female character, chemistry that flies off the page, and a murder mystery and you get Ellie Marney's contemporary young adult take on Sherlock Holmes. 
 Country girl Rachel Watts has only been living in Melbourne for a few months, but she's already good friends with her ""academic genius, social moron"" neighbor, James Mycroft. The two, who refer to each other by last name only, are taking a nighttime stroll to the zoo when they stumble upon the dead body of a homeless man. Soon, Mycroft and Watts find themselves in the middle of a murder investigation that eventually leads them into the lion's den--literally. 
 What really makes this book shine is the relationship between Watts and Mycroft aka ""Wattscroft"". While Mycroft may be Watts' intellectual superior, he still treats her like an equal and their personalities balance each other out: Watts is surprisingly tough, having grown up on a farm, and often acts as the voice of reason for the analytical Mycroft whose tragic past sometimes turns him reckless or brooding by turns. 
 The mystery itself is compelling and well plotted, but we dare you to pay close attention to the murder investigation without getting distracted by Mycroft's ""anarchy curls"" or the unresolved sexual tension between him and Watts. We impatiently waited for them to figure out they were Made For Each Other, and the payoff made us swoon. 
 Marney doesn't just limit realistic qualities to her protagonists. The book has a diverse--in more ways than one--cast of secondary characters, especially Mycroft and Watts' friends, Mai and Gus, a Vietnamese girl and a Sudanese guy who are hiding their relationship from disapproving family. Even Watts' parents are fleshed out, not the typical distracted/absent guardians so often found in YA novels, which is refreshing. 
 In the end: Read it! Following Watts and Mycroft as they get closer to the murderer--and each other--will have you holding your breath until the last sentence. The sequel, Every Word, is even more explosive."
2,"This was...different. 
 I am a big fan of Kitty Thomas' writing. Comfort Food is one of my all time favorite erotic/dark erotic books. So, I went into this one with high expectations. And though I still enjoyed her writing style, and the dark and twisty feel...I have to say this was a disappointment. 
 I loved the idea of a dominating hero who was a vampire. I loved the idea of him waiting 6 years to 'claim' her. However, I spent most of my time just not liking Christian at all. And it wasn't because he was an anti-hero (I have a weakness for them after all). The connection just wasn't there for me. And for the sake of full disclosure, I have to admit that part of my problem with the actual story was (view spoiler)[...Christian's need to take her virginity over and over...and over...again. I mean, he's a vampire, and he gets off on 'healing' her to the point where each time he has sex with her, she's intact? That aspect just really bothered me, for whatever reason. (hide spoiler)] Also, the ending felt very rushed, though I had begun to warm up to Christian's character by then. 
 I have read a lot of dark erotica...so it wasn't like I went into this expecting hearts and flowers between the two main characters. After all, you can't get much darker than Comfort Food, and I loved every word of that book. But, I just wish there had been more emotion from Christian before the last few pages of the story. 
 Perhaps my expectations were too unrealistically high going into this. But, even though I was left feeling disappointed, I'm still a huge fan of this author's writing and will definitely read the rest of her work.

4,"Hellooooo, new obsession! It's so nice to meet you! 
 It's been a while since I've read a good book. And I mean like a really good book. And I'm not really one for faeries, but this....oh, mama. 
 So, those of you who know me...well, you know I don't really ""do"" faery books. I think the extent of my faery knowledge is Peter Pan and the Shakespearean sonnet ""A Midsummer Night's Dream."" (OH MY GOD THAT'S WHAT THE BOOK IS BASED ON?! YAY ME.) 
 Seriously, this concept is GOLD. Like...twenty-four carat, wear-on-your-finger-all-the-time-to-show-off-to-your-friends gold. Playing off these sonnets from Shakespeare and bringing back the names of these faeries that we think we know = GENIUS. I don't think there was a single character that didn't interest me in one way or another, and the faery realm is so colorful and unfamiliar that I really felt like I'd slipped away from reality for a little while. 
 I will admit that at times it seemed like the descriptions bordered more on ""telling"" us things instead of showing us, and sometimes the descriptions took away from the action that happened literally a page before. But the descriptions helped me visualize the world I was in. For that, I am grateful. 
 As most of my Goodreads friends know by now, I have a list I keep titled, ""Best Book Boyfriends."" And I am pleased to announce that (despite my initial misgivings) Prince Ash has made my list! Good lord, is he amazing or what? *womanly sigh* Such a deep character, not to mention a looker, too! 
 One thing I would have like to see more of in this book, though, is more challenging setbacks. Any time there was a conflict, it was almost immediately resolved, and that took a lot of the suspense out of a potentially awesome scene. I'm one of those weirdos who wants the bad guys to win, even if it's only for a book or two. But when a heroine that basically does nothing and gets caught like ninety-nine percent of her screen time in the novel escapes so conveniently, it makes you wonder if she's just an instrument of the plot. I reaaaally hope not! I hope we see some more depth to Meghan's character and really see how she, Ash, Puck, and Grim will turn out in the other books of the series. 
 Now I just have to get my hands on them! 
 To Barnes and Noble, Ironhorse! Take me to my newest treasure!"
4,"I love this series because Balogh writes about the slow growth of relationships and how recovery from trauma takes time. This book is focused on two people who find friendship before love and the shapes fear, guilt and grief can take."
4,"this series is eerily similar to j.d. robb's ""in death"" series...it's not as good as those books but not bad either...the murder mysteries are a little less complicated in this series..."
3,"Based on the reviews of my friends, Eleanor & Park seems to be a love-it-or-hate-it young adult novel. 
 **Possible Spoilers Ahead, But Nothing Major** 
 It centers on Eleanor, a teenage girl who is insecure about her body and has a troubling home life, and Park, a somewhat squeaky-clean Korean-American boy. Throughout the novel, their relationship progresses from tolerance to friendship to an all-encompassing love-which is where some of the criticism lies. 
 A few of the reviews I've seen for this book lament the strange progression and lack of chemistry between the two characters. I felt the progression seemed quite natural and the lack of chemistry-which was occasionally mentioned by the characters, both aloud and throughout their inner monologues-made the characters seem more real. No relationship is perfect, especially when that relationship involves two young adults. 
 My only complaint is that the story isn't particularly grabbing until about halfway through. I stepped away from this book for about a month without even thinking about or realizing it, but when I picked it back up and made it through a few more pages I found that I couldn't put it down. Their relationship was sweet and made me nostalgic for that type of young love that you can only experience once or twice in your teens. 
 There is some heavy stuff in this novel, too, but the ending leaves it all a bit unresolved-the heavy stuff and Eleanor's & Park's relationship. The heavy stuff in particular only seems to be touched on at a surface level; we never really delve into the why's of it all or how it affects the characters on an emotional level, especially when we find out the twist at the end. 
 Again, I wasn't blown away by it but I would definitely pick up a sequel were Rowell to write one."
3,"So, this book took me way longer to read than I anticipated and I want to blame dinosaur times. I know everyone loves dinosaurs but I'm just over here in Meh-County. 
 The book starts out quite interestingly but then it gets into bogus territory for me when the team receives a transmission from a station in the future but the message is incomplete and they still do what they think is the right thing and it messes things up and we get a time wave that makes everything change and Liam ends up in prehistoric times. And then it takes forever for them to get out of there. Seriously. Most of this book is dino times (I know I'm repeating myself) and maybe my problem wasn't so much the dinosaurs but the fact that the secondary characters were all a bit bland and then there were also these chapters we get from one of the dinosaur-thingies perspectives and no. Just no. 
 What drives me nuts here is the fact that these three teenagers are thrown into this agency without any information and the book addresses some of this but doesn't give any answers. They're just left alone with a video FAQ and that's it. Good luck, kids, figuring stuff out as you go along. And actually, they make more havoc than they actually safe the time stream. 
 What made this a firm 3 star book to me was part of the ending though. (view spoiler)[ When Liam and Becks return and everything is still jungle outside the field office, Becks is sent back in time to kill the dinosaurs responsible but at the same time, Liam is sent back to 1941 to keep the plates from being found. 2001 is jungle because Becks hasn't corrected it but somehow 1941 isn't affected? This doesn't make any sense. Maybe I read over something because I was pretty bored and didn't read every freaking sentence but come on. How? That was just lazy writing imo. (hide spoiler)] 
 So, there you have it. I'd love to see more of Maddy and Sal in the story the next time because I really like them but they were hardly in this story."
3,"I received this free from the publishers via NetGalley for review purposes. 
 There is a legend, about a cursed girl with green skin and grass for hair. Legends say she feeds on poisonous plants, they say she can grant wishes, but they also say that her touch is deadly. Lucas lives in his fathers hotel during his summer visits to Puerto Rico, and he has grown up listening to the legend of the cursed girl. One day Lucas' new girlfriend disappears and he starts to receive strange letters in his room. He turns to Isabel for answers, and he soon finds that her strange world is connected to his. 
 A Fierce and Subtle Poison is also another book that I am conflicted about. I really enjoy magical realism, and the premise of this sounded really great. Unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations. 
 Lucas, our main protagonist, is not a very unlikeable character. He is boring, and all his focus and attention lies around girls and partying. This focus took attention off the actual interesting aspect of this book - the cursed girl and her legend. I would have much preferred more attention being focused on Isabel. I actually would have preferred this book to be from her POV. I really couldn't care much for Lucas and his obsession with girls, his lack of concern for his newly deceased girlfriend, and his haste to move on to other girl. 
 That being said, I did enjoy Isabel and I did enjoy the mystical/magical element of her curse but I wanted more of her past and wished her character had been fleshed out a bit more. I enjoyed Samantha Mabry's writing, and her descriptions. I enjoyed the setting, and I found the story line and mystery interesting albeit predictable. 
 Overall, a decent read which I would probably recommend to fans of magical realism."
4,"Non-spoiler quick review! I'll post the full review to my blog soon. These are my initial thoughts! 
 ---------------------------- 
 There is a term given to three women who share separate but similar stories: they have each been the last ones standing in brutal horror-story level massacres. Lisa lost nine sorority sisters to a college dropout's knife. Sam went up against the Sack Man during a late shift at the Nightlight Inn. And then there's Quincy, who escaped the woods from Pine Cottage from the man she can only refer to as Him. Five friends went into the cottage and only Quincy made it out alive. 
 They were the lone survivors. They're dubbed the Final Girls. 
 10 years after that terrible night at the cottage, Quincy Carpenter, despite everything, is trying to live a normal life. And she's succeeding. Then, suddenly, Quincy finds out that Lisa is dead and it's ruled an apparent suicide. This prompts Sam to suddenly appear at Quincy's door, hellbent on figuring out Quincy's past and current life, because Quincy's memories of that fateful night have been blacked out since it happened. It's something she used to be content with. All of this causes Quincy to question if she's truly moved on. Each of the girls has secrets and Quincy is now trying to separate the truths from the lies from those around her. The story unravels from here. Secrets are exposed, intentions are revealed, and the reader is given glimpses into what really happened on that nightmare of a night so many years ago. 
 This story has been compared to a rollercoaster ride and I think that's truly accurate regardless of the cliche. It takes you on this WILD ride that grips you until the *very* end. Riley Sager is a fantastic writer. The pacing is fast and the intensity builds and builds, which is exactly what you want with this kind of story. You HAVE to know what happens next. I think the most exciting bits of the story happens when you read segments from the past and begin slowly piecing everything together. Or attempt to, at least. The twists and turns will leave you feeling woozy in the best way. I was blown away by this book. By the intriguing plot, the well-thought out characters, the REVEALS, the ominous tone, the layers of storytelling--everything! This is one of those books that once you pick up, you find yourself not being able to put down until you know everything. The last 30% was utterly exhilarating. And the end of the novel has me sitting here reeling. I'm so impressed by this debut work. You should all go ahead and add this to your TBRs, pre-order it, all of that, because this book is going to be huge. Especially if you love thrillers, slasher films, and mysteries. I really enjoyed reading it. 
 I received an ARC of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. Thanks so much to the the publisher, Dutton, Penguin Random House, and to the author, Riley Sager, for giving me this opportunity. 
 Final Girls will be available in stores on July 11, 2017!!"
5,"I cannot begin to describe this book. It is passionate and thought-provoking, intelligent and emotional, full of love, lust, political intrigue, interwoven plots and twists & turns everywhere. The ending is satisfactory without being ""too neatly"" tied up. The writing is full of wonderful description (it does have a decidedly ""Spanish"" feel). Makes me wish I understood Spanish well enough to read it in the original. 
 In short, this is a great story, well-written. The ""art of reading"" is NOT dying if our book club has anything to say about it!"
5,"I am very fortunate that Gail Carriger picked this title as a book club read a few months ago. I didn't read it at the same time, but seeing the name pop up as they discussed it made me scoop it right up when I came across it at work. 
 I just devoured this book. It's a good ol' hardcore merc sci-fi tale, with an awesome female lead. I liked her, I liked the secondary characters, and the world-building was interesting. It also flowed very smoothly making it a very quick read. 
 Now I reaaaaaaaaaaally want to get my hands on books two and three - so nice not to have to wait for them to get released."
5,"Divergent is amazing. Seriously amazing. I love everything to do with this book, and it's definitely one of my all time favorites. I haven't read this book for 2 months, so I probably won't go into much detail. 
 Divergent is a story about a dystopian society, where the city is seperated into 5 factions: The Dauntless (the brave), The Candor (the honest), The Abnegation (the selfless), The Amity (the peaceful), and The Erudite (The smart). This was pretty well done, and the world building was done really well. Our main character, Tris, has to chose her faction, but soon discovers that she doesn't wholly fit into any faction. She is divergent, which is considered a dangerous anomally. 
 Tris was great. Really, one of my favorite characters ever. She was brave and kind, and I really liked her. She seems to care a lot for the people she loves, and I live how she stuck up for her friends all the time. 
 Four was fantastic. Ohmygod, I absolutely love him. He was pretty mysterious in the first half of the novel, but we get to know him a bit more towards the end. He was a really interesting character. 
 The secondary characters were great as well. I got Will and Al mixed up a few times, but I loved every single secondary character. Every character was done really well, and I didn't feel like there were any hollow characters. I especially liked Eric, because even though he's cruel and often torments Tris and her friends, I just felt that he was a really interesting character, and he was a great villian. 
 I absolutely loved loved loved the romance here. I loved Tris and Four together, and they really suited each other. 
 Divergent was a fantastic story that I recommend for everyone. Seriously. If you haven't read it yet, go to your local library or bookstore and get it. I can't guarantee that you'll like it, but it's definitely worth a read. 
 5/5 stars. (as I predicted, I couldn't really go into depth because I haven't read it in a while. Maybe sometime I'll rewrite this into a better review. (Again!))"
5,What an amazing book! I never have thought that I would enjoy a YA book this much. It doesn't even feel like a YA book...it is a bit dark...a bit shocking and bloody. The only thing YA about it is the love triangle which was really irritating. The characters were interesting especially Peeta whom I am madly in love with. The action was great and engaging when the Games finally started...I couldn't stop reading. I can't wait to see the movie :)
5,"Upon my second read, I have decided that this book is brilliant. =)"
5,"This is one of my most anticipated books for 2016. I was blown away to receive a copy of this book (THANK YOU DISNEY HYPERION, you seriously made my year!!) But before I completely lose my mind over how much I enjoyed this book, let me give you a little background information about it. Etta lives in present day New York. For as long as she can remember, her mom (Rose) has traveled and always been distant towards Etta. Etta feels that shes doesn't really know anything about her mother. Etta is a serious violin student and has thought that playing was always in her future. One night when she is about to perform at a concert, Etta overhears Rose and Etta's violin teacher, Alice, fighting. Etta thinks the argument is over something do with Etta playing the violin. That couldn't be farther from the truth. I won't give away too much of the story about what happens next, but Etta is forced through a time travel portal. When she wakes, she is in the 18th Century and traveling on a ship. On this ship, she meets Nicholas (who is from this time period). Despite the difference between the centuries that they live in, they strike up a strong friendship. Etta soon discovers that she comes from a family of time travelers and that there may be a reason that her mom kept the secret from her. She also discovers that she was forced into this situation by a man named Cyrus Ironwood. Etta's mom has hidden something from him and he is determined to use any means necessary to get it back. He blackmails Etta and holds something over Nicholas' head that he has always wanted (not to mention that Nicholas must keep this a secret from Etta). From this point, Etta and Nicholas go on a journey guided by clues Rose left for Etta through her childhood. This adventure takes them through WWII London, 17th Century Cambodia, a wrong turn through 19th Century Paris and finally through the desert of Damascus. Their journey also makes the bond between them grow stronger and the secret that Nicholas is keeping from Etta harder to keep. 
 Now, for the gushing over this book. IT WAS FANTASTIC! This is the first time traveling book that I have truly enjoyed. It was smart and very well thought out. I love books that are entertaining, but at the same time have messages within them. For instance, Nicholas is not Caucasian. He is constantly held back because of his skin color and no matter the century he is in: it is always a factor. The whole premise of how these people are able to travel is so wonderfully planned, that it almost seems possible. Traveling is not easy to do and there are stipulations that make the story more complex. It isn't as easy as saying ""Hey, let's travel to WWII London today!"" Instead there is almost a science to it and the characters have to go to one place to get to the others! Some books are good in the fact that they make you empathize with the characters (like with Nicholas), but you can just feel like an outsider watching these characters. Passenger makes you feel like you are there with them traveling through all of these wonderful places. Bracken does an amazing job of describing all of the events and landscapes surrounding Nicholas and Etta. Nothing about this book is predictable - I loved that! For instance, Nicholas eventually tells Etta his secret and the secret doesn't tear them apart the way that you think it would. I was cheering for these characters as they escaped danger or when certain things happened between them (the turning point when they spend he night in underground London may be one of my favorite scenes from a book - ever). I also was devastated at the end of the book over something major that happens. 
 You seriously need to get your hands on this book! Also Alexandra Bracken will be visiting Parnassus Books in January, so make sure you keep your eyes out for that event (I know I will be there!). I could go on and on about how much I loved this book and how I can't wait for the sequel (seriously, the only bad thing about getting a book you have anticipated for awhile is waiting even longer for the sequel!). So instead of rambling on and on about my Etta+Nicholas feels I will leave you with my favorite quote from the book. This quote hit home to me because sometimes I feel like I am just trying to worry about next thing on my list instead of enjoying my time, at this moment. Sooooooo, here you go: 
 ""...they had forgotten the most crucial part of life -- that it wasn't meant to be lived for the past, or even the future, but for each present moment."" 
 I received an advance copy of this book for an honest review."
4,"I'm not sure anything could measure up to the heartbreaking wonderfulness of Winters's first novel, In the Shadow of Blackbirds. This is better than a lot of historical YA in that it isn't merely a romance dressed in historical trappings (looking at you, A Mad, Wicked Folly), but it also just doesn't reach the same heights as Winters's first. 
 Cat Winters excels at ambiance and atmosphere. Like the spiritualists in Blackbirds, the hypnotism elements of this book were spot on. She's also clearly done her research with regards to the time period (and I'm not just referring to the pictures, although those are neat too). Every detail felt accurate, and while I'm sure the language was perhaps a bit ""modernized,"" this didn't feel like modern teenagers who happened to be wearing corsets. There's a fine line between immersing the story so much in the language and slang of the time period that it becomes incomprehensible and going so modern that the time period might as well be irrelevant (I think Gail Carriger has written about this issue -- she's another master of ambiance, albeit a completely different type!). Winters is able to walk that line quite ably, so that even when the plot itself wasn't holding my interest, the setting kept me going. 
 Speaking of plot -- our protagonist is suffragette Olivia Mead, whose father disapproves of her scandalous leanings. He hires a hypnotist to take all rebellious thoughts out of her head. It's quite creepy the lengths to which Dr. Mead is willing to go to exert control -- yes, it's a tad on-the-nose, given the time period, but there's still something incredibly unsettling about a female character who is only able to say ""All is well"" whenever she gets agitated. It leaves her completely vulnerable, as she soon discovers. The hypnotist, faux-Frenchman Henri Reverie, also opens Olivia's eyes to ""see the world as it truly is."" Which...again, kind of on the nose given that she literally starts seeing monsters and women disappearing (because they have no voice! Because voting!). It helps that Olivia is obsessed with Dracula, so she often makes comparisons to Stoker's novel -- it keeps Winters's message from veering too far into soapbox territory. This could so easily have ended up preachy and eye-roll-inducing, but Winters manages to stay just shy of that extremity. It's a close call though. 
 The problem, which I've seen several other reviewers point out, is that most of the characters (save for Olivia) are cardboard cutouts. Her father is evil and controlling -- he literally becomes a monster before her eyes (and he's a dentist, which in the 1900s was basically the same as a sadist, so not too much subtlety here). Henri has the potential to be interesting, but we don't get much more beyond his tragic backstory. (view spoiler)[His sister has breast cancer and he only agreed to hypnotize Olivia because the money would pay for her surgery. But he feels rilly rilly bad about it! I think I actually would have liked to see Henri be more ruthless. Instead he's all wibbly and whiny and I found myself almost hoping that there would be some 11th hour twist where his sister was evil and draining his life force a la Dracula or something. But no, that part is actually as straightforward as it seems. (hide spoiler)] The ""love interest"" Percy of course turns out to be a complete lout, with zero redeeming qualities. Even her female friends don't have much to do -- they are for women's rights. The end. Olivia's mother could have been an interesting character -- she ran off to New York to be an actress when Olivia was four -- but again, we barely hear about her. Yes,(view spoiler)[ Olivia is going off to live with, or at least visit, her mother at the end, (hide spoiler)] but I wanted to actually meet the woman who seemed to have such a substantial effect on the main character. 
 Ultimately, I liked this, but I wish we'd had some more complex characters, instead of cardboard cutouts."

 2.5 stars. 
 I am so conflicted writing this review because I didn't completely hate this book. There were a lot of things that I did like about the book and a lot of cute moments that made me smile. Not to mention that the sex scenes were written well! On top of the things I liked was our hero, Dragon. He was definitely an alpha but not to the point where I wanted to beat him on top of the head with a stick. And his moments with Trix were just so adorable and honestly very lacking! I so wanted to see more of an interaction between the two of them, it really warmed my heart. 
 Okay, so now on to the things I didn't like about this book. Let's start with the first and somewhat most annoying aspect. Brenna. Holy crap, did she get on my nerves! I'm not gonna lie, there were moments when I really did like her, like when she beat the shit out of Dragon's ""old lady."" And her reasons behind doing so were entirely justified and not out of some cliched jealousy. But other then that I couldn't stand all of her lying and really bad decisions that gave me so many WTF moments. It was those moments that I felt for Dragon the most honestly. 
 Let's just move pass all of the annoying terms like ""old lady"" and even more annoying terms of endearment like ""mama."" Because those are mostly just my own personal pet peeves. I think what bothered most people with this book was the scene where Dragon back hands Brenna. Christ, how hard I cringed at this part of the book! It was hard for me to completely stomach reading the rest of the book after this scene and honestly what's forcing me to give it two stars. 
 I am twenty one years old and I clearly know that when a guy hits a girl and says that he's sorry and he's never going to do it again that this guy is full of shit and that you need to pack your shit and leave him ASAP. Because no good man would ever lay his hands on a woman and what pains me is that young girls are going to read this and think that if he's sorry enough and kisses you enough and promises to never do it again that he won't and that it makes everything okay because he's showing remorse. But this is not the case, ladies, please. 
 I grew up in this type of environment, this ""gang"" lifestyle and much like Brenna, my dad was a very important and dominant member of his own gang. And he told me from a very young age to NEVER allow a man to lay a hand on me because when a man does it once, he'll do it again and that's just a fact. I'm not trying to get preachy on a book review but this really hit close to home and not just from the way I grew up but also because I've had friends go through the same thing and this is a quote from a friend of mine who experienced it first hand, ""It was like after he hit me that first time, he never hesitated to do it again afterward."" 
 I'll leave the review at that as that one scene is what affected me the most and I don't think that it's a good message to be sending out to younger readers. I understand that this is suppose to be ""gritty"" and whatnot and it might work for some people who can look past that stuff but unfortunately I can't and it somewhat ruined the better parts of the book for me. But I have heard that the second book is better so I'll probably still be willing to give it a try!"
3,It was a good romance book but reading this I've realized that when it comes to romance books I prefer the historical kind with feisty heroines defying the patriarchal society. The contemporary background isn't all that appealing to me.
3,"This wasn't my favourite of the series but it also wasn't terrible, either. This felt like a solid 3.5 read. I was warned in advance of flowery prose and boy is there ever a lot of it in the first 65% or so. While I love love loved Mena (big love to loving big girls!) and was so happy to see her get her happily ever after after such a brutal beginning (not only in this book but carrying over from earlier books) and Liam could be incredibly charming at times (though some of the 'woe is me I'm such a Demon Highlander' kind of wore on me), on a whole this story was not as strong as books one and two in the series. I did really enjoy the secondary characters, Liam's children in particular, but found the 'mystery' of THE HIGHLANDER to be a bit predictable and the romance both too intense too fast and also.. drawn out. 
 While book three didn't rate as high as the previous ones, this is still a very enjoyable series and I'm so happy to have discovered this author and look forward to even more of her wonderfully dark broken anti-heroes."

 YEEEEEEEEEEEES. Laini Taylor's back! 
 If you aren't yet familiar with Taylor's work, she writes beautiful prose and has an imagination with no limits. She probably has an obsession with moths, dreams and monsters. Her books are fairytales written for us mere mortals. And I love everything she does. So yeah, a bit biased here but hear me out. 
 This story centers around a myth, gods and monsters, and the sweetest person to ever exist - Lazlo Strange. That's all you should know before you ask yourself the following question: have you read Laini Taylor's books before? If you haven't but like fantasy, this is a great place to start because her style is pretty consistent. If you didn't enjoy Daughter of Smoke and Bone however, I'd suggest passing on this one. I've found out that for some people her style of storytelling just doesn't work and that's okay. But for fans of Taylor: you are in for a treat. 
 I want to reread this again immediately. The sequel couldn't come soon enough!"

 Review originally posted on My Blog 
 This book is insanely amazing! I must say it's just as good, or better than the City of Bones. It didn't let me put it down easily, especially when I was at the last remaining chapters. I didn't really mind how lengthy those chapters were to be honest because I thoroughly enjoyed every single moment of the book. 
 It kept my adrenaline going. It's such a thrilly, freaking amazing flight! I love how the characters developed more in this book. Simon turning into a vampire, the introduction of the new werewolf kid Maia, and the hot-damn shadowhunter Malik (although he wasn't completely highlighted in this sequel), the digging out of Luke's real feelings towards Clary's mom, Jace's struggle to keep his feelings for his 'sister', Imogen Herondale's mysterious words to Jace at the end, Magnus and Alec (oh my God, Magnus and Alec??!), and especially- my most favorite scene- the kissing scene at the Seelie Court when they met the Queen! What was that?! This book is making me insane! 
 It also has lots of funny moments. I found myself literally lolling like an idiot while reading those parts, especially the part where Simon and Jace continued their annoying yet amusing banter. And that Magnus and Alec's confusing 'thing' over there. This book is such an entertaining one! 
 I didn't really regret diving into the world of Mortal Instruments. As I've said, this second installment is quite better than the first book. But while it's an awesome continuation of the City of Bones, I'm a bit upset. It could have gotten more than 4 stars but then, I thought I wanted more. There are still questions that are hanging, but of course, that's part of Cassandra Clare's scheme to make us lured into the next book, but I was really, really desperate to find out the answers to my questions. This book didn't provide me those, so I was kinda sad. :( I guess I really have to extend my patience and read the next book to be able to know what's really Jace and Clary's real relationship because I really don't believe they're siblings. Seriously! I also didn't like how Jace and Clary's conversation ended during the last part of the book. It's heart-shattering I literally cried. Why, I feel for Clary. :( 
 The ending was also a cliffhanger. I don't blame the author for doing that. Maybe I'm already quite immune to those kinds of endings. In fact, I'm already expecting cliffhanger endings every time I delve into a series. Well, well, life's just like that. Right now, I'm itching for the next book City of Glass. I want to see where all these goes. :) 
 My Rating for this Book: 4 Stars (This book is totally worth reading!)

 Reincarnation is an interesting idea in itself. ""Grasping at Eternity"" also did a phenomenal job of approaching it. The author really is the real deal in fantasy and romance alike. 
 In many YA novels it's obvious that the MC and the love interest will either be brought together or reunited in some way. I thought it would be the same in this situation and it seemed like it would be, but then something impossible happened. I began to doubt that Maryah and Nathan would have a happy ending, I gained the impression that it could go either way. Ms. Hooper didn't give me the option to keep reading when she introduced this doubt, she forced me. There was no way I could stop once that happened, her writing became my air until the end where I finally took a breath before realizing I needed the sequel. 
 The author's writing style also captivated me with both it's hump and serious aspects, but that wasn't what I liked most about it. I loved watching the characters grow and flourish within themselves as well as in their relationships. I really felt a connection with them and I easily related to the majority of them multiple times. They were astoundingly human for their circumstances, I admired them for their perks and quirks and wanted to be them at several points. 
 If you like your YA fantasy with an extra helping of romance you will probably love this book. I suggest that you get to reading it ASAP!"
5,So much action and what a cliffhanger!
4,"To read my full review visit my link text 
 Flavia de Luce is back and she's slinging her trademark brand of droll witted deductions and chemical romance on the North American side of the pond. Don't confuse this 12 year old Sherlock Holmes in braces and braids with Nancy Drew - in fact in this installment of the series she comes across a library book starring Nancy and has a ""never-heard-of-the-chit"" reaction. Classic! 
 In this novel Mr. Bradley has Flavia ""Banished"" to Canada, specifically, to attend Miss Bodycote's Female Academy. Aunt Felicity has arranged for her to attend the same school as her mother, Harriet, to be trained to assume a role in a secretive organization referred to as ""Nide"". 
 As always the mystery is superb. And I really liked the character of Mrs. Bannerman as well as many of Flavia's schoolmates, I will be sorely disappointed if this Academy storyline is not pursued in someway or another. Perhaps Aunt Felicity can do something in England, maybe importing instructors and the like. 
 This novel was provided by the publisher for a honest review."
4,"SPOILERS! 
 . 
 .

 It's sentences like these that make me love Karin Slaughter: 
 The rifts in Sibyl Adam's skin gaped open like tiny wet mouths. 
 Lena imagined Hank liked working in this dark, dank place, passing his days in an environment more suitable for a tongue. 
 They're so vivid and gritty and real. I don't think I've read anything like her. I will say that this and Pretty Girls were difficult to read as there are many descriptions of rape. These are bad enough, but then KS goes into detail with what it's like to live life after rape and the emotional toll it takes on you. It's like I couldn't continue to read them, but my fingers wouldn't let me stop turning the pages. 
 It's hard for me to believe that this is her first published novel because of how gripping it is. There were only a couple minor issues that I have with the book. 
 1) This small southern town only has a few people who are racist?! Please. Unfortunately, I know what racism is like in small southern towns and it's far more common than this books lets on. I think this would have been more believable had KS wrote more about W. Harris and racism throughout the town. 
 2) I guessed who the killer was before I got halfway through with the book. Wahhh wahhh- I hate when that happens. There were too many signs pointing to Jeb, so it wasn't a ""thriller"" until the end. 
 HOWEVER...KS is a master at these stories and I've guility already purchased the next one in the series, Kisscut."
5,"Victoria, you have stolen my heart. Forever. I am in love with every word that is in this book. Certain trilogies develop middle book syndrome where book 1 becomes an exposition and book 3 is the epic finale and book 2 flops somewhere in between to basically just serve as a means from getting from a to b. This book CERTAINLY did NOT do that. What amazing amazing amazing amazing book. From the description, I thought this was going to be Goblet of Fire style tournament taking place across the whole book. But by the time I got to the tournament I had already read nearly 200 pages of story. Kell and Lila are so thoroughly developed in this story that I could have read a story about them playing chess with each other and loved it. Lila's story is essentially what is driving this plot forward but it in no way feels forced. I simply feel like I am on her journey with her. And Kell's personality, situation, and decisions have created such a contrast to Lila's story that when it alternates between the two, I found myself not wanting to return to the other's story. Then that would change by the time it switched again. 
 She could write a hundred books in this universe now that we know how big it is and I think I would read every single one of them. What more can I say about this book other than finish book 1 and start this one immediately. Oh an fair warning (as noted in the acknowledgments section) there is a cliff hanger. And though it's V.E. Schwab's first one, it's brutal. Hopefully Shade of Magic #3 will be out in the not too distant future because this took the cake out of any book leaving me wanting more."
4,"4.5 stars! 
 I totally didn't expect to like this one as much as I did!"
0,im extremely hurt by how much this is tainting the purity of book 1 and am gonna stop right here and try to forget everything that happened
4,Read this a while ago but I remember the ending made me sad and it wasn't happy. Julia was also a pretty controlling bitch at times if I remember correctly and I'm not a fan of bitchy characters. It was an interesting modern take on The Great Gatsby. And the love story was pretty cute.
4,"This was definitely a very fun read, with a lot of potential for the coming books."
2,It was completely character driven and Spark had a keen eye for observation of human nature etc but I still couldn't make myself care about them!
3,"I like Amy Lane's work and Dex in Blue is very much more of the same. I think it's slightly too similar to previous books though and so I had trouble connecting to the characters. Dex in Blue is a companion piece to Chase in Shadows and the same events happen in both books, although from different perspectives. I think it's almost better not reading CiS first because the repetitive events and changing characters. However that said, DiB has the same feel but is definitely lighter. There is not the same level of angst and emotional brutality as the first book and there is a pretty big bow tied on everyone at the end - everyone gets babies, jobs, money, houses, love, and security! It's a bit much no doubt but Lane puts her characters through the emotional ringer so the big splashy happy ending is the payoff. 
 This book focuses on Dex, Tommy's best friend from book one, and Kane, a young stud working in porn because that's all he's good at and he needs the money. The events initially jump back and forth catching the reader up on past events that happened in the last book and showing where exactly Dex and Kane fit into that mess. This beginning is very choppy and disorientating. Time leaps forward in big chunks, sometimes years at a time, to coincide with Tommy/Chase problems while trying to establish Dex and Kane's backgrounds. There is so much information thrown in at the beginning it can be overwhelming. I kept trying to reconcile what I knew from the previous book to the events of this one. I really wish the book hadn't taken this route and instead wrote how these two came together on their own without the need to tie them in so completely with the previous couple. 
 Due to this, Kane and Dex never really emerged for me as their own separate couple. Instead they feel like pawns and caricatures. Both men have these wild emotions in response to very manipulated events. In CiS, there is a lot of emotional turmoil but the characters, their responses, and the situations felt very organic and natural. Here the situations feel artificial and forced. They exist to force the couple to face something specific in their relationship. A lot of this is due to the repetition of events from the first book but even circumstances specific to this book feel manipulated. There seem to be certain popular elements that come into play - irresponsible/bitchy women, unwanted babies, evil families, almost angelic men forced to hurt themselves and their loved ones for the greater good - that feel too familiar. 
 I did like how Kane and Dex's relationship grew and matured, as it's one of the best parts of the book. This feels natural and understandable. It's easy and there's some minor tension and drama before the big I love you's, but nothing emotionally torturing. These two feel like friends turned lovers who are happy. Of course everything happens really, really fast. In a few months they're sleeping together then getting married with a kid but it's romance and that's almost expected in big happy endings. Even though the story likes to throw more and more over the top situations at the characters, I liked that they handled it together and never really let that connection waiver nor were they unable to function without the other person. They maintained some assemblage of independence while acting as a couple too. 
 For the most part I liked Dex in Blue, though not as much as the first book. I really like how much lighter this story is and how it focuses on the happy moments rather then dark angst. It's an easy book to read, especially with numerous sex scenes. I simply couldn't connect with Dex and Kane very well and the ending feels way too easy. It's sweet, sure, but too syrupy for me. I'll be interested to see if the next book in the series can offer either characters or situations that step out of the box and offer something different or fresh. Lane is an exceptional writer that can build emotion and drama to a fever pitch, but I'd love to see a fresh character that totally steps out of the mold in this world."
5,"I just finished listening to the audiobook version of this book (and as a sidenote--I love listening to Wil Wheaton read books to me!) and I really enjoyed it! I loved the idea, and it was an incredible mix of existentialism, fatalism, theology, and a fast-paced, lives-on-the-line action novel. My only complaint was that all the characters seemed to only speak with the work ""said"", which got really repetitive in the audiobook version. Other than that, it was fantastic and got me through a whole lot of tedious labwork with an odd excitement to it."
5,"This is an ARC review. 
 I've read a few of Jessica Park's books in recent months and they're great. But none of them have come close to how Left Drowning has blown me away. 
 Park has written a story that pulls at the reader's emotions. Pulls in many different directions, and it doesn't let go even after the story's over. It does this by creating characters that have so many great, loveable qualities, as well as many flaws and troubled pasts. 
 What I really felt was great about Left Drowning's storyline is that it wasn't just the story of Blythe coping with her tragic past and finding herself. It was also about the Shepherd family, who are in need of their own way to deal with the past. It's a complicated journey, but that's not a negative. It's organized and won't trip the reader up. There are so many different issues occurring at once that there isn't a boring part of this book. I kept on reading and reading and becoming more emotionally invested in each character as it went along. 
 Why is there a mention of sexual content in the description? Well, this book does get very steamy at times. And I feel like this wasn't added in just for the sex appeal. I felt it was a great tool to show a unique bond between characters. It showed the passion, the hurt, the need for escape. 
 I haven't come across a book like Left Drowning in a long time. It pushes the envelope in some aspects, but with a story like this it pushed just far enough without going over-the-top. It's realistic. The characters drew me in. The overall emotional feel throughout captured my attention early on. When the characters relived their troubling events, I felt like I was there seeing it with them. I wanted to help in some way. Park is very effective when it comes to the descriptions in this book. There won't be many readers with dry eyes, at times. But there will also be many smiles, especially when Sabin in involved."
4,A little misrepresented but so tangibly written.
3,"I feel a little bit let down by this, because I was expecting so much more of the other gladers, but I got much of the same as the other books. One thing to note is that Thomas describes his time at WICKED as boring, and I felt like that for most of the book ... bored. Because it's futile; you know what happens to the characters, and I think James Dashner did a good amount of foreshadowing that for people reading The Fever Code before the main series. (It's also a punch to the gut for us seasoned TMR veterans.) But reading it afterwards feels pointless. 
 Not much actually happens during this book, for the amount of time it spans. I feel like it's all stuff we've heard of during the series. (view spoiler)[I really wish we could have seen the Maze from the other gladers's points of view, I think that was what a lot of peoople were looking forwards to. I wanted more Newt. I wanted Newt's suicide attempt from his or Minho or Alby's points of view, not just looking at it from an outside perspective again. Thomas ... he really didn't have that much to do and it was nice and all to see it but the Maze would have been much more exciting - watching how it formed and the social structures and the Gladers getting used to it. (hide spoiler)] 
 Don't get me wrong. TMR was a big part of my life a couple years back and I still love all the characters. Maybe not Thomas and Teresa much but I love, loved, LOVED Newt, Minho, Alby and Chuck. I loved seeing their histories and the gang all ALIVE AND TOGETHER MOTHER FUCK-- 
 Anyways. Yeah. It does make me want to reread the series but the majority of the book wasn't what I expect from Dashner."
2,"The only Pratchett I couldn't finish. Hated it. Didn't feel like him. Dark, full-on lecture mode, characters out of character."
5,"What I think: 
 When I first saw this cover sitting on the shelf, I was completely in love with it and bought it. From the first page I was completely excited. It opens up to a character called Karou, a girl who has blue hair and loads of secrets inside of her. Literally! Well it opens up to her ex-boyfriend, Kazimir as he pretends to be a vampire! I laughed when I read this part because it was completely hilarious later on when Karou finally finds out what Kazimir means what he says... I felt like this book was impressive as I continued reading. I couldn't put it down for only about a few minutes, reading out Karou's life with her guardian, Brimstone. This surprised me as the characters start to become unusual but it was amazing. It surprised me from the first page... 
 ""Once upon a time, an angel and a devil fell in love. It did not end well."" 
 As I continued through the story I felt even more excited as I read through Akiva's life. His fingers sculpted by the many killings of a chimaera and his love for chimaera, Madrigal. His wings and the first meeting with Karou and her painted eyes on the palms of her hand. 
 As Akiva talked about her, I was deeply confused but it immediately surfaced at the end of the book where Karou finally finds about her true self. Who she really is. Who she is meant to be. Questions will be answered as the final chapter is read. Throughout this, she finds out about her life before this one. How Akiva fitted into her life has finally made sense. This was getting exciting until the ending. A huge cliff hanger! I know, cliffhangers don't make your day but all I could think about was how amazing this book was. 
 Deeply amazing. 
 Final Summary: ""I love love love Daughter of Smoke and Bone. It was amazing and I was entranced from the very first page as I read through the pages in minutes. Definitely impressive and deeply amazingly brilliant!""

2,"When Pia finds herself forced to steal from one of the Elder Races, she has to drop her identity and flee to the Elven lands. And it just had to be Dragos, the oldest and most powerful. But of course he's caught scent of his prey and he's not about to let go. 
 This is probably 75% smut and 25% plot/character development. It's one of those alpha-male pinning down the beautiful-and-so-feminine-but-yet-so-strong heroines. 
 There's a bit more bdsm feel in here than I prefer (Pia is definitely edging on the submissive). Certain phrases made me wince. ""Good girl"" said to her when she's being serious and other phrases make me internally fume. 
 I can see why people like it (the smut is steamy and quite explicit). But if we want to spend a little time looking at actual characters... well eh. There's more words devoted to their physical imagery rather than their personalities. His pecs were satin over iron. Her delicate and feminine scent. You get my drift. 
 And the idea that she's been slacking off on her training and can still throw down with his personal guards? Yeah, Mary Sue alert! She can heal, is a ""special race"", has a strange ability that is never explained (hello, huge plot point that is never used again!), can beat up the top fighters, is tough but also a girly-girl. Hmmm... what do we have here? 
 Was also not happy with the idea that she used the AmEx card. Sure, it wasn't for her, but it was still not her money. I don't really get why it's acceptable as a form of ""revenge"" after Dragos buys her a present. I feel like there's some sort of disconnect here... The principle is still the same: you don't want to accept his money in exchange for being his girlfriend/mate/sexunicorn/whatever. But it's okay to take it and give it away for charity? I don't understand. 
 I talked more about Pia's character problems than Dragons, but that's more because we follow her in the story. I don't even really know where to start with Dragos. He's more of a stereotype than a character, so meh. It's hard to go into detail. It's all of the things you expect. You're mine! Don't touch! I'll move all of your stuff into my house without asking because YOU'RE MINE! And so on. Their conversations never really get resolved either. She always brings up the issues and then it devolves into sex or him picking up one thing to change. (i.e. please) 
 Also, I'm a modern girl too and I do give leeway for romances novels. But meeting within the span of one week and then getting pregnant and being completely in-love? But really, here. Seven days is like a blink of the eye for him. And it's still short for mortal people too! 
 Two stars. Good for a trashy romance. Okay, fine. It might not be ""trashy"", just ""steamy"". But it really is just okay."
5,"I am very impressed by the Booker longlist this year. And this was my first experience with Richard Powers, and he is someone I'll read more of. 
 ""I wanted music to be the antidote to the familiar. That's how I became a terrorist."" 
 A lot of what I liked about this book is personal, and I can't expect most people to have the same experience. If you majored in music, this is definitely going to resonate with you on more levels. 
 Those elements: 
 -Musical language, well it permeates everything. The main character is a composer, not necessarily all that successful. Entire descriptions of compositions that you only can hear in your head, plus a very lovely telling of the first performance of Messiaen's Quartet for the End of Time. 
 -Bloomington! There is more than one connection to the town, but that's where he lives in the present day, and he names places I have been. 
 -Synaesthesia and composing to cause change in the world - sounds like Scriabin although he's never named. Ironic, because one of the papers I submitted that successfully got me into a PhD program at Indiana was on this topic. 
 -George Crumb, who I met a few years ago. His philosophy is quoted extensively near the beginning, alongside John Cage who I wish I had met. 
 -A major and attempted career in music, only to feel deep down it should have been the hobby.... 
 Somehow all of this is wound around a story about a composer who retires and starts manipulating DNA, and is on the run from the FBI for bio-terrorism. The ending was satisfying and I enjoyed the story along the way. I stayed up until midnight reading ""the last 300 pages."" 
 There are no chapters. Just almost 400 pages with no break, but that goes along with how the story is told, backwards and forwards in time. There are little excerpts that are explained later, and I won't ruin that surprise. 
 ""Be grateful for anything that still cuts. Dissonance is a beauty that familiarity hasn't yet destroyed."" 
 ""To call any music subversive, to say that a set of pitches and rhythms could pose a threat to real power... ludicrous. And yet, from Plato to Pyongyang, that endless need to legislate sounds. To police the harmonic possibilities as if there were no limits to music there.""

4,"Ruby was so determined to be a success her father didn't want to support her any longer and she found herself homeless and jobless. She meets Bancroft at dinner hoping to convince him to let her stay at his condo while he is away for 5 weeks. She realizes he is the hot guy that kissed her and got her sick that she wasn't able to audition for a show. Bancroft felt bad and as a way to make it up to her, he asked her to stay at his condo and to take care of his pets. Their attraction to each other grows but Ruby needs to feel she is making it on her own. 
 I really liked this story and the banter was very funny. I thoroughly enjoyed the slow burn progression of Bancroft and Ruby's relationship from strangers to friends and finally to something more. I sort of wish we had seen more of their conversations while he was away on business and she was house sitting for him, but I was still able to feel the connection between them, so it wasn't something that took away from the story in any way."
5,Wow. A fantastic finish to easily one of the best fantasy series I have read thus far.
4,"Addicted to You is a New Adult Contemporary Romance about a couple who enable each other through their addictions. 
 The story line is compelling, the characters are engaging and the writing is engrossing. The authors collaborated and handled the subject matter quite well, using the main characters to establish a very raw and true portrayal. The story is told in Lily's POV, the characters come to life through her disquieting voice; annoyingly blase about things as the elite rich can be but as the story developed they showed also a very human side. The protagonists did eventually evolve as well as one hopes for people to evolve in this kind of situation. So Hope springs eternal. Other than some major overlooked flaws in the story(ie: the fashion show; she was wearing a dress then she was wearing jeans then she was back to wearing a dress), the format, spelling, grammar, etc. were fine. 
 I finished this novel in the matter of hours and found myself anxious to find out what is to become of ""Lo"" and Lily. There is delicate subject matter with alcohol addiction, sexual addiction, abuse of drugs, an attempted rape, cussing, cutting, mention of suicide, and well let's just say that this book is not for the faint of heart with all the subject matter that is dealt with. An engrossing emotional read. I like the cover. 
 3.5 out of 5 Stars"
4,"NO SPOILERS!!! 
 I decided to give this book a go because it was 99 cents on Kindle and I have to say I really enjoyed it. I have been having a hard time lately finding well written, interesting series and I feel that this gave me hope that I havent already read ALL the good books out there. If you are on the fence on whether or not to read it, I would recommend giving it a try. While it may have some similarities to Twilight (and really anymore, WHAT isnt compared to stupid freaking Twilight) it has more differences and is a fun read. It is not in my top 20 fav series, but it maybe 21 :)"
3,"It is somewhat difficult to say how I feel about this book. I liked the ideas about what technology could look like, from medical reconstruction to brain programming to layers of imagery on the world to the digitization of knowledge. (The commentary on the destruction of print books is surprisingly interesting and completely unexpected.) However, there was a big chunk of the story that I did not get, probably because I had not read the right books (or didn't remember them), so I missed the references. This caused me to just skip pages and pages of action because I did not care. The beginning, too, was difficult to navigate because it kept flipping from character to character, and I was not compelled by any of them for about the first third of the book. 
 I almost put this down when I got into my third page of skipped action during the ""belief circle riot"". However, I stuck with it, and the ending was more bearable and understandable. It wasn't quite the payoff I had hoped for and the ending leaves the reader hanging, but at least it all wraps up in a comprehensible way."
3,"Thanks Goodreads - I found Ranger's Apprentice because a comment on Jennifer Nielsen's The False Prince mentioned it positively for those who enjoyed Nielsen's series, and it's always a wonderful pleasant surprise to accidentally stumble upon something like this. 
 The Ruins of Gorlan sits very firmly in the realm of younger YA. It has a cracking, pacy plot, a likeable cast and a general story arc that doesn't deviate much from staples of standard fantasy fiction, but is nonetheless an enjoyable read. 
 The best thing about this series? There are a whopping twelve books to read (hurrah!) and all of them are finished! Can't wait to devour them all over Christmas break."
4,"William Kambkwambwa was always a curious child. His curiosity about the workings of the world took a hit when his family was unable to afford to keep him in school. But he tried to keep up, going to the library and reading everything he could. He was particularly taken with books on science and on how things work. In this engaging and uplifting story, the young inventor tells of his experience in Malawi constructing a working windmill from bits and pieces retrieved from junkyards, using a design based on a book he got from the library. But the story goes well beyond his personal experience. He tells us about his community, a small village reliant on agriculture for sustenance and imperiled by the vagaries of nature and a corrupt government. He introduces us to his family, his much-admired father, his friends, the village chief, and offers a real feel for what life looks like in this part of the world. There is a long section in which Kambkwamba reports the frightening details of when famine struck his village, how the families coped, or failed, how the government responded. It is riveting material. Also of considerable interest is the degree to which people in Malawi hold on to a belief in magic one would have thought had faded long ago. William was at risk of being persecuted as a witch for his invention. Some people were killed as the hungry sought a magical explanation for the lack of rain, and scapegoats were found. That is as chilling as his tale of drought and desperation. 
 In the latter part of the book, the young inventor is finally discovered and we see some of his wonder as he is introduced to a much wider world and finally comes to gain a society of peers. There can be no doubt that William Kambkwamba is a remarkable young man, and that he will continue to achieve great things, for himself, for his family, for his village, nation and for Africa. This book should be counted among those achievements."
5,Woah
5,"What an amazing mix of fantasy and sci-fi. I typically don't read science fiction but was really intrigued with how Cinderella fit into this new futuristic world. The writing was beautiful, enough description to let you really see New Beijing but not over the top. There were also plenty of twists and turns in the storyline but there were also a few things that you knew were going to happen so it wasn't a shock when they were revealed."

0,"Stephen King recommended this book from EW picks 2013. He said: ""A group of adolescents--little more than children, really--meet at a camp where kids explore their creativity. Ethan, Jules, Cathy, Goodman, Ash: All believe they are meant for great things. This assumption of huge talent where there may be little or none lies at the heart of Wolitzer's novel, which sweeps across a span of decades. There's sentiment here, full and wholehearted, but little sentimentality. Like The Corrections,The Interestings addresses one of fiction's great themes: how we make peace with our own shortcomings and make the best of ordinary lives."""
4,"Part 'best of' from the blog, part 'new' this is a collection of blog-like stories with Brosh's signature illustrations. 
 Fans will recognise some of the most popular blog posts (sadly ALOT is missing), including two recent very touching posts on depression, the ever popular CLEAN ALL THE THINGS and a collection of funny stories about dogs. 
 My overall impression was a quick and funny read that was a bit like revisiting an old friend. I did find the sequencing a bit jarring in places, particularly the final story which is why I havent rated it higher."
4,Laugh-out-loud funny. Off to find book 2...
4,"Compelling narrative voice, engaging writing. What most impressed me is how realistic the protagonist's unknowing is - she can't be anything but isolated from everyone who could help, and because of this level of oppression and isolation she can't feel certain about anything or anyone. The exploration of doubt was also interesting - doubt is necessary to protect herself from trusting the wrong person, but doubt is also necessary for keeping her hope alive. Truth could be too final, too crushing."
4,"This book starts off where the first one ended. I didn't enjoy this one as much as the first. I did enjoy some of the twists that happened though. Will be reading the third once it comes out. 
 (view spoiler)[ Harper, Ryan, and David are still trying to work together. They start to get along better until they come across Bee and meet Alexander. Everything goes from there. Will they find David? <\spoiler> (hide spoiler)]"
5,"So not what I expected, and so much better. Can't wait for the third!"
5,"I cannot express my love for this book. So refreshing, so real, so needed. Very realistic ace-rep, very touching characters, very nerdy plotline. All the love, forever."
3,"Opal is a young glassblower who can infuse small glass statues with a spark of magic, allowing other magic users all over her homeland of Sitia to communicate with each other over long distances. As long as someone with magical abilities holds a glass animal she made, they can talk to another magic user holding another. Despite years of lessons at the magic academy, however, Opal doesn't appear to have any other powers whatsoever, and this causes other students to tease her and avoid her. Her role in helping Yelena Saldana (the heroine of Snyder's first trilogy) save the country from rogue evil magicians is well known, but she is disappointed that she seems unable to do more with magic than make communicator devices for mages. 
 Opal is charged by the academy's Master magicians to go to the Stormdancer clan and discover what is breaking their glass orbs and killing their dancers. The Stormdancer magicians can control the weather, and channel the energy from storms into special glass orbs that are then used as a type of battery. But if one of the orbs break, the dancer using it will die instantly. So far, two have died, and Opal and the youngest of the Masters, Sitara, have to figure out what is causing the orbs to break before more Stormdancers die and the storms in their area of Sitia run out of control. 
 Despite being doubtful of her abilities to help, Opal solves the mystery of the brittle glass and earns the respect of the Stormdancers, including the brooding Kade, whose sister was one of the dancers killed when an orb broke. On their way back from the Stormdancer clan, Opal is kidnapped. A group of renegades want to learn the Stormdancer secrets and are prepared to torture her to get them. She manages to escape, and discovers that she can channel another magic user's power into an empty glass orb while she is fleeing a magical attack. 
 Back at the Academy, the Masters are very interested in studying Opal's new powers. It is quite obvious that she is not the ""one trick pony"" the other students have been accusing her of being. But she is still in danger since she is one of the few who know the Stormdancer glass secrets, and she has to figure out her feelings towards two men, Kade the Stormdancer, and Ulrick, a young man from her home village who's come to the Acedemy to see if he too has magical abilities connected with glass. 
 I was a big fan of Maria V. Snyder's Study trilogy, especially the first novel, Poison Study. The other two books in the trilogy were neither as exciting or gripping, but Snyder created a fascinating cast of characters, especially Yelena and Valek, and the books were entertaining enough. Opal is a supporting character from the first series, and unfortunately, she is not as engaging a heroine as Yelena. She survived a pretty horrible ordeal in the previous series, and this has obviously affected her, but she seems rather stuck up and self pitying, and instead of being grateful for the magical abilities she does have, keeps wanting more and being sulky. She is also a bit of a pushover, and too easily led by others. 
 This does change a bit during the course of the book, but she still has a lot of growing to do as a a a character to stop being annoying. The vague love triangle in the book just did not hold my attention at all. Kade is interesting enough, tortured and broody, and with some very cool powers. But Ulrick was clearly just a whiny jerk, who while he'd been treated badly by his family was not really sympathetic at all, but overbearing, controlling and like a walking list of danger signs in a potential boyfriend. Even Opal doesn't really fancy him, just seems to settle on him because Kade isn't available to her. 
 Some of the supporting cast are good, but others are frankly as annoying as Opal's non-romance with Ulrick. Her sister Mara, in whose shadow Opal has always grown up, is supposedly pretty and talented and someone admired by everyone, but she just irritated me, and some of her advice to Opal was dreadful. The youngest Master Magician was promising as a supporting character, and I'm hoping that Opal may be developing a few friendships that can go good places, so that there is more of an appealing supporting cast in the sequels. Opal does discover some pretty cool powers, but the set up for the next book (which will be all about Ulrick the douche) didn't exactly fill me with excitement. Still, I bought the whole trilogy in a 3 for 2 sale, so will read them all. But probably not right away."
5,I want to move to Tucker Springs.

 Second Read"
5,"** spoiler alert ** 
 I ought to write my individual reviews for each book in the series but I figured that it's more proper for me to consider each book as part of a whole saga (containing seven arcs) encompassing thirty years in the life of John, a human transported into another realm - a world where his housemate Kyle came from. 
 The epicness of this series is just beyond me! I enjoyed and loved every second of reading this ten-part series. What I appreciate most though is the fact that as much as possible, the author tried solving all the loopholes in it. What totally bugs me is the conclusion which I would be discussing a little later on. 
 So John along with his friends (a couple named Laurie and Bill) were accidentally transported into Basawar (think of a Narnia-like world minus the talking animals), the place where his odd housemate Kyle ""apparently"" came from. Kyle is the ""Kahlil"" who was destined / ordained to kill John who's the incarnation of their god. He's the human seen by the oracle who will be destroying all of Basawar. 
 The plot of the story thickens as John meets the young handsome priest Ravishan who is training to become the next Kahlil. Meeting Ravishan made their tumultuous entrance into Basawar more bearable but their world is about to get more complicated as John and his friends found themselves under the Bousim household where John was forced to accompany Firiki (The son of the lady in Bousim household) into the doors of Rathal'pesha to train as an ushiri (in contention of becoming a Kahlil). There, John meets Ravishan again and has shown potential to become a priest himself. Due to discrimination, he was relegated as some sort of a medic priest. As the story goes by, John was able to piece everything together coming to the conclusion that Ravishan and his housemate were one and the same, although John first meets Kyle as a Kahlil and this kahlil in training - Ravishan is the guy he fell in love with. 
 At times, the story tends to be a tad bit confusing because of the interchanging timeline in it especially during the second arc but as it went by, it's just like reading some sort of backstory although at one point - the past and the present (see, Kyle followed the trio into Basawar) meets (ala Lake House meeting of some sort) and their reunion was truly one for the books. 
 I actually cried a little for John who is now known as J'aitbaya. I cried because he's been living in Basawar for 30 years and was still nursing his broken heart from his separation from Ravishan. Although one and the same. Kyle still felt different from Ravishan. It's like he's simply a replacement of his young self. But all the same, John still love Ravishan and gave the same affection to Kyle. 
 Now the question bugging me at the end, is Kyle immortal now like John? After he passed on, he was possessed by the holy bones of the young Ravishan. Did he become immortal himself the way the oracles are immortals? I sure hope so because these two more than deserved to be together especially after what they have gone through. 
 To conclude this, I wished that more people would read this series because of its exceptional story that you'd regret missing. The humanity in it is truly heartfelt and the way John and Kyle have proven their love and devotion for each other was truly an amazing feat. It's just so beautiful it almost hurts. 
 'tis definitely one of my favorite series - another great feat to achieve by one of my new favorite authors - Ginn Hale who brought us the amazing Wicked Gentleman and the stunning Lord Of The White Hell. Indeed, Hail Ginn Hale!"
4,"I'm pretty sure Mom read this to us as children, but I didn't remember it. I was delighted to read it myself. I was impressed with how much Baum was able to pack into a simple, short, well-told story. I wish I had read it to Michael when he was younger - it would make a great read-aloud book."
2,"Another review of mine that Amazon deleted. The main thing I remember about this was that it seemed more like a lead up to the real story than the story. I was not inspired to read the next book. 
 I received this review copy from the publisher through Amazon Vine."
3,"This is a twisted post-apocalyptic world where people live underground in a silo because the surface has somehow been horribly corrupted. Although they have a sheriff and a mayor, the silo is run by a malicious IT department, and the worst thing you can do is ask to go outside. You'll get your wish. Howey creates an aura of desperation and dread that permeates his writing. You'll feel the horror of the world and the claustrophobia of the silo, and you'll want out too. 
 Luckily the characters Howey developed moved me from desperation to hope. It's not really a character-driven story, but the characters are good. The book read like different stories being pasted together, although they fit together in an ingenious and suspenseful manner. I guess it started out as short stories, and it still has that feel, but with plenty of twists and suspense. The plot still moved me right along and kept me reading. 
 The weakness for me was the writing itself, and too much internal dialog, going over and over the issues at hand. The characters are alone through long swaths of the book, and so they have long internal dialogs with themselves. I found myself skipping over much of it. I think it could be condensed down to a shorter book and it would be much better. Nonetheless, I recommend it. A fun read."
5,"What to say? I don't know where to begin, not without spoiling anything, so I'll just say this is a must-read, but you you must read books 1-4 first, or it won't work. Lanyon is very good at explaining important points of the plot from previous episodes, but the whole relationship tension, the build up to this whopping finale? You need to stay the distance. 
 Gutted that I've reached the end of the series. Still living with it. Would love to see it on TV. Will read it again. Brilliant."
2,"I must admit that the majority of the reason I read this was purely not to be spoiled. Very rarely has a tacked onto a series book been worthwhile and actually added something rather than cheapening the series. So I went into this with low expectations. 
 And I wasn't surprised at all. 
 The story is very self-referential, even more so than the original series. The premise is merely there to bring up the past and play with it just like a piece of fanfic. This is the type of story that a die hard HP fan dreams up in their head rather than a new story from J.K. 
 The best term for it is fanwank. It's a fantasy purely to give someone cheap pleasure. And it leaves you feeling a little dirty afterwards."
4,"Wow! That was a great ending. In the end, there was closure for everyone but with a few happy surprises as well. 
 Joe Hill did an amazing job creating the premise, having children as main protagonists in an otherwise unbeatable, sneaky and cruel villain as Dodge. I gasped out loud as i read and i was moaning in despair through all the horrors they have all gone through. Oh, i wish i can live and be a Lovecraft as well. Amazing story!"
5,"**UPDATE** 
 I re-read with the audiobook & the narration is wonderful. 
 BUT MY HEADPHONES FAILED ME just in time for my phone to should ""...masturbating and crying into your pillow, Joshua?"" to the gym. Honestly, it only makes me love this book more. 
 Oh my God, this book is perfect. Perfect enemies-to-loves, perfect office romance, perfect contemporary. I'd re-read it immediately if I had time because I want to stamp every sentence into my heart. 
 I love so much about this book, but my favourite thing (right now at this moment) is how weird they are with each other. It's like how I talk to and think of my husband. 
 The Hating Game had me giggling and swooning and crying a little bit in public. I couldn't stop. 
 I cannot wait for more from Sally Thorne."
3,"Another series from my childhood. Loving the trip down memory lane! 
 I don't think that I ever realized that this trilogy was how Fear Street came to be cursed. Although maybe I just don't remember that fact. I do remember loving this trilogy though. 
 Nora Goode witness a horrible fire, one that she can't believe even though it is happening before her eyes. She decides that she really needs to record the horrible history between the Goodes and the Fiers, a history that starts in year 1692. 
 Susannah Goode never did anything wrong except in the eyes of the Magistrate Benjamin Fier. He did the worst thing imaginable. He framed and accused Susannah and her mother Martha of practicing witchcraft and sentenced them to burn at the stake. Why? Because in his eyes Susannah was not good enough for his son Edward, after all her family was poor. The night before Susannah and her mother were to burn Benjamin and his family dissappeared in the night. The town would not stop the scheduled burning no matter how much Susannah's father begged and pleaded, even though the Magistrate had dissappeared with no explanation and stole from the Village of Wickham, Massachusetts. 
 Benjamin Fier was right that there were witches living among the people of Wickham. But it wasn't Susannah and her mother. The real witch vowed revenge on the Fier family for all the pain that they had caused and he was going to get revenge no matter how long it took him to track them down. 
 I love this book still and it had a few scary and creepy moments. Not as scary now as when I read it as a kid but still creepy."
3,"I received this book to review for the ReadIt&Reap program in the group ShutUp&Read. Thanks to the mods and author for providing this book for us to read. 
 This book wasn't the most terrible one I've ever read, or even close to that. I just feel there are so much more negative things to say than positive, and that makes me sad. 
 Our heroine is a sixteen year old girl named Mercy Moore. She attempts her first kiss with Paul, and during the kiss she almost kills him. She soon finds out she is half succubus, so naturally there is a collection of boys falling all over her. A lot of things confused me, but they were explained more properly at the end. I just really struggled to get there. 
 I didn't like Mercy that much. Well, her taste in music was superb, but that's about all. At first she started out as a girl who wanted to be part of the Elites, and at that point she was relatable and almost likeable. Then she just did so many stupid things. Also, I think I could have liked her more if at ANY point in this book she took a step back and said ""what the hell is going on?"" She was absolutely clueless. I know that's not her fault, but she should have demanded more from her mother. Flynn had some decent character development throughout the book, but he's probably the only character I felt anything for. I don't have to like every character I read about, but if I'm constantly feeling the need to shake some sense into the heroine (who I think was supposed to be fairly intelligent) it makes for a less enjoyable reading experience. 
 Okay, so I have to talk about the love pentagon. A triangle is fine, really. The idea to have 4 guys constantly obsessed with Mercy (half succubus or not) was just too much for me. Sorry. I understand completely what the author wanted to do, but at a certain point I was just like ...Can we chill with this for a minute?! 
 Now onto what I did like. The story was very different from any other stories I have read. It does have originality and creativity. I also liked the vocabulary words! This book had a great start, actually, but then it dragged and annoyed me. In my opinion the Cambion series does have potential, but definitely has room for improvement. I personally am not interested in reading the next part, unfortunately. Many other people have given this book good reviews, so maybe it just wasn't for me. 
 3/5 Stars"
4,"I had really enjoyed Wright's article about Paul Haggis (""The Apostate"" in the New Yorker) and this is the natural next step - Wright has an engaging style, and clearly so much of this is coming from interviews, because you couldn't make this stuff up. Horrifying and captivating - exactly what you'd expect from a book about Scientology. A must-read."
4,Loved this! Grace Burrowes is one of my favorites.
5,"I picked this up because I watch the movie (which by the way I had no clue as to what the movie was about until I watched it) and thought it was kinda bad ass. Of course when I heard it was based off a book, I had to read it because the book is always better, I thought it was better. I thought it was cool and different from what I normally read. 
 I liked the characters: John, Henri, Sam, and even BK (Bernie Kosar). Of and how could I forget # 6. She was all around totally awesome and I wish I have her skills."
4,"IF I STAY left me feeling raw and hallow inside. WHERE SHE WENT did the same. I was hesitant on picking up this book, even after pining for it since I learned of its existence. I got the ARC in the mail, and I just stared at it. I was afraid to open it because what if it wasn't as good as IF I STAY? 
 It was good as IF I STAY. Not as emotional as IF I STAY, but oh my god, is it worth the read. 
 It begins three years after IF I STAY. Mia chose at the end of IF I STAY, and Adam has had to deal with that choice for three years. When Adam is in New York for the night, he ""runs"" into Mia and they have that one night to catch up with each other. 
 I liked that this book was told from Adam's POV. How many times do you get to read a book from the POV of angsty twenty-one year old? Exactly! It also allows readers to know parts of IF I STAY from Adam's view, and oh, my. I still believe Gayle Forman is a literary genius. 
 This book will leave you wanting more, even though this book does tie up the strings. It's a beautiful book, and Forman is perfect at creating characters. They're flawed, but wonderful. I want Mia and Adam to be my friends. 
 On April 5, go out and buy this book. You will want to read it."

 *3.5 stars* I'm having a real hard time debating on whether or not to round this rating up or down, but for now I'll just leave it at three and see what happens XD 
 I originally picked up this book based on my friend Danika's recommendation, and while I can understand why she (and many others!) loved it, it just wasn't for me. 
 WHAT I LOVED 
 The setting: To those of you who are not aware, The Diviners is set in New York. Bray obviously did her research because from what I can tell, the novel is historically accurate (with the exception of a couple author liberties.) Being completely enthralled by the city, I of course enjoyed this aspect of the story. If you would like a full bibliography, you can visit the official website TheDivinersSeries.com. 
 The atmosphere: Again, Bray definitely did her research! This is a historical fiction, set in the 1920s. A large portion of this novel was focused around everyday life during the time period, and it truly felt as if I was there with Evie. 
 The characters: The cast of characters in this novel were brilliant. Evie was incredibly spunky, Sam was charming, and Jericho was such a mystery! Each of their back stories were intertwined perfectly, and adding a lot to their character development. 
 The family aspect: A common complaint about young adult novels is the lack of family support. The Diviners does an excellent job of avoiding this cliche. Will, Evie's Uncle and temporary guardian, had a huge roll in the novel, and was surprisingly one of my favourite characters. 
 The horror: I have always been a fan of horror, despite my obvious lack of fully immersing myself into the genre. This novel has several incredibly creepy scenes which made me morbidly giddy (just to clarify, I was happy because of the presence of horror in the novel, not the actual horrors themselves.) 
 The end: The last 100 (or so) pages were seriously amazing. The finale of this novel had me on the edge of my seat, and while there was a definitive solution there was also several new questions left to be explored in a sequel. 
 WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE 
 The pacing: Not going to lie, this novel bored me. While I really liked some aspects of it, there are so many character perspectives and flashbacks that it disrupted the plot significantly. Though I loved the characters, I didn't feel completely invested in them because I felt detached. I feel that some of the scenes could have been condensed, making the novel shorter and more cohesive in general."
4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 A complex steampunky fantasy. Lots going on and some interesting world-building. This book has been compared by some to Pullman's Dark Materials series, and the comparison is well-deserved. It's absorbing right from the start, and Johnson has clearly done a lot of work to create the society(ies) represented here. Unfortunately, like Pullman's DM books, it doesn't really hold up on its own. I'm looking forward to reading the sequel(s) to find out the rest of the story. 
 This book was really fun to read, but it lost a star for starting many, many plot threads that have not been resolved, and for sketchy development of non-protagonist characters. 
 (view spoiler)[ I'm disappointed by how quickly and completely Piper is accepted on the 401. This is a big change and deserved more development than a single action sequence and a few pages. Also, SO MANY unanswered questions! What are the meteors and where do they come from? Who/what are the chamelins? Who/what are the sarnum? I need to know more about the dichotomy between city dwellers and the scraptowns. If the 401 is neglected/outdated, how does it have the budget for the luxurious accommodations and provisions provided to VIP passengers? What is the story behind the dragonfly tattoos? Who gets them, and why? If they can be forged, what good are they? (hide spoiler)]"
2,"Take faeries, innocent young girls, put them in the early 1900s in an alternate universe over a steampunk setting and you have Innocent Darkness by Suzanne Lazear. 
 The unique setting of Innocent Darkness was what caught my attention. The Fae is real, but a little different than the usual fae that we see in young adult novels. Every seven years, these faeries take a young girl with The Spark, wine and dine her, giving her everything she could ever dream and hope for and then sacrifice her to the earth to renew their magic. Kevighn Silver-Tongue, a hunter for the High Queen, is given one more chance to make up for losing the last girl that was suppose to be used for the sacrifice and time is running out as the magic becomes unstable and slowly begin to disappear. With his world - and himself - at risk, Kevighn must undertake the challenge, even though he has lost some heart. 
 In the human world, it's the turn of the century, early 1900s and Magnolia is a head-strong, smart girl who is living in a society that will try its best to stop her from making her own decision - after all society knows what's best for women! Through a series of unfortunate events, she finds herself in a house for girls, where the heads are set on stomping out any individuality and making the young ladies into ladies society will welcome. 
 The premise of the story, the setting... everything was aligned for a wonderful tale, however, I found Innocent Darkness lacking. It started of with a bang, Magnolia - Noli - and her friend Steven - V - are caught illegally flying a car that Noli fixed and Noli ends up in a reform school in San Francisco. The things that happen at the school are very real and I felt for poor Noli and found myself rooting for her to remain the same and not be broken. Then, Noli is taken into the Otherworld and everything goes downhill from there. 
 The biggest issue that I had with this story is the love triangle! It's not just that I'm not a fan of love triangles that I found an issue with it, it's that this love triangle makes absolutely no sense to me! I'm sure there might be a bit of Stockholm Syndrome going on, but the way that Noli falls for Kevighn when he's basically going to kill her was quite unbelievable - even the little explanation between Noli and Charlotte felt flat and forced. Also, the way Kevighn became enamored with Noli was also unbelievable and a little creepy, especially when he keeps comparing her to his younger sister. 
 The other issue I had was Noli's behaviour towards the end. Yes, I get that she wants to go home to her mother, but she seems a little out of character towards the end, almost acting like a petulant child and this caused me to lose any respect I built up for her in the beginning. 
 The first half of the book flew by, but I found myself slowing trudging through the last half, as the characters irked me. It's a shame this happened, the story really was interesting and the setting was gorgeous, I wish I could have cared about what happened to Noli and her friends in the end, she had such great potential. But alas, in the end it wasn't a tale for me.

4,"What a sweet ending for Noel and Lanie! 
 A truly enjoyable read :)"
4,"Don't touch me I'm emotional. 
 Although seriously I could see that plot twist coming from a mile away thanks booktube for hinting at that spoiler"
4,"NO BODY TOUCH ME I AM FEELING SOME SERIOUS EMOTIONS! 
 Damn, that ending. It deserves a five stars for that plot twist. Unfortunately, the book it self wasn't quite as amazing, maybe being my least favorite of the series, but still really great none the less. I adore the characters, and I think this novel really set up some interesting stuff for the upcoming books. I need to read Bands of Mourning like right now."
4,"I almost couldn't put this book down. I really liked the characters and the narrators voices. The story wasn't mind-blowing, but it was very engaging."
3,"**3 stars** 
 Buddy read with: Chelsea 
 Well, after nearly a year on my bookshelf, I finally read this. And unfortunately, it was pretty much just average. 
 The beginning, however, was not good at all. I mean, talk about a steep slope to get passed. Phew. That beginning left me extremely bored and had me losing interest in the story fast - and I even considered DNFing it. However, because I hate doing that and because I was buddy reading this novel, I pushed on through. And was I happy that I did? Mm. Yes and no. 
 Yes, because the book did end up getting better the further you read. I liked finding out about ""The Boy in the Casket"" or ""The Prince"" - the whole backstory surrounding him, Hazel, Jack, and Ben. It was pretty interesting. 
 No, because the story continued on being slow, and I really didn't like Hazel. She was obsessed with boys, and literally every chapter was filled with her wanting to kiss someone, being jealous of her brother kissing someone, wanting someone she couldn't have... Ahh, it was too much for me. The girl needed to chill. 
 Overall, it was an imaginative story. I thought it would be a lot darker than it was (though I think Holly Black tried really hard to make it eerie, I just never felt freaked out while I was reading. It was just all kind of borderline weird/fairy-tale like, and while I do enjoy that, this book was obviously supposed to be something darker). What I'm pretty much trying to get across is that this novel was about as average as you can get with a book, before it turns into a ""bad novel."""
4,"I really should have reviewed this sooner. I'm now halfway through the final book! That said, I'll be sure not to let happenings in the final book influence this review. Plus, I was just SO busy this week. SO BUSY. 
 WARNING. THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS FROM BOOK 1. If you have not read the first book GO DO IT, YOU FOOL. 
 You will have noticed that I have given this 4/5 and not the 5/5 that The Final Empire received, but you must understand that I still LOVED this book. I could not stop reading, my heart was pounding and I am just in adoration of the world that Sanderson has created. There is a huge amount of depth to everything that goes on. This amount of detail is something I aspire to be able to write one day. 
 That said, I'm going to talk about the few issues that stopped me from loving this book as much as the last. 
 1. The pacing. I don't mind a slow book full of politics and introspection, really. As long as I love the characters and the setting (which I do here) then I'm set. That said, this book really could have been a couple hundred pages shorter. It wasn't a HUGE issue for me, but if you are a reader whose attention sometimes wanders, that will probably happen at times here. 
 2. Zane. Zane is a pro and a con. He was a wonderful addition to this book. Right from the moment he appeared I loved him, and then he only became more interesting and more complex. I think, having lost Kelsier, Zane's presence really helped soften that blow. But I was so, so disappointed with how his plot turned out in this book. It was my biggest disappointment of all and made me wonder what was the point? 
 3. Still a severe lack of women. We gain a couple, but it's not enough. 
 4. Vin's angst. Vin really started to grate on my nerves in this book which was a shame, because I love her. I didn't mind the angst at first, but because this book is so heavy on the introspection it ended up being very repetitive. I also think her relationship with Zane took a slightly jerky step forward that had me scratching my head at some of her decisions. 
 The good news with Vin is that she gets over her angst at eventually, and from then on she became awesome again. So that bodes well for the final book at least! 
 Other than those issues, this series is just amazing. I have realised that I am a lot better at picking out issues in books than I am at pouring adoration on the things that I loved. But there was so much to love here! 
 I love the complexity of the characters. Elend's growth here was really wonderful, and needed. He's a very refreshing hero in that he tries very hard, but he isn't a natural at it. I love that about him. Sazed continues to be wonderful, and the little flashes we see of Marsh were incredibly exciting. There is still so much to learn about those Steel Inquisitors! The rest of the crew are given plenty of attention, with Breeze standing tall as my favourite. There was some really LOVELY stuff with Breeze. Even Clubs gets some great development! This is where the slow pace of the book really pays dividends. The reader is given plenty of time to love the characters. 
 The standout for me, along with Zane, was OreSeur. I LOVED the gradual development of OreSeur's relationship with Vin. LOVED IT. It was easily one of my favourite parts of this book. 
 Other than the characters, the overall plot continues to reveal itself carefully. This is a series that was planned to the finest detail and you can tell. Bits and pieces are revealed to us, and the sense of it all adding up was really satisfying. Sanderson is brilliant at building tension. The encroaching mists, the thumping that Vin can hear getting louder. It was all built up wonderfully. And I love that there was so much more to Rashek's story than him just being a villain. I expected it, but it was good to see it confirmed. 
 And seriously, if these first two books are anything to go by...then Sanderson is a MASTER of writing a nail biting ending. Obviously I can't talk about it...but the ending was so good. Any slight feelings of disappointment I had were swept aside in the rush that the ending gave me. 
 What more can I say to convince you to read this series? Actually, if you're reading this far and you haven't started reading then you're silly CAUSE I SPOILED BOOK ONE FOR YOU DAMMIT."

4,"""It's easy to lose your soul in high school."" 
 A coming-of-age tale with a spooky twist! Maggie McKay is starting her first day of high school after being homeschooled by her mother for years. 
 It's time for Maggie to face the outside world, all on her own. And maybe make a new friend or two--one who isn't one of her brothers. 
 This story is truly and exceptionally great! 
 I honestly wasn't expecting it to affect me so deeply. 
 I could really really relate to Maggie during that nerve-wracking first day. Everything she was feeling was exactly what I went through and it even brought me memories of my first day (which I can't quite decide if that's a good thing or not) (I hate first days). 
 Simply put, Friend With Boys is a perfect growing up story with incredible family relationships and friendships. 
 There was this one perfect part in the story that put into exact words how I feel about this graphic novel: 
 I felt like it was made just for me. 
 This story is definitely going to stay with me for a long time. 
 4.5 stars

4,"The art is so amazing, quiet and peaceful."
5,"This series just keeps getting better and better. And funnier and funnier. Really makes me feel better about my own crazy Italian family. 
 Makes me sad that Stephanie and Morelli may not be an item in the next book, though. I love Ranger. Just not for her."
3,"This was my first experience with this series, but I didn't feel lost at any point. Most of the book was engaging and the plot was interesting. I didn't particularly enjoy the flashbacks as many of them had poor transitions and it took me a while to understand we were in the past. And I would have given this a 4-star review if that terrible time-jump ending hadn't ruined everything for me."
4,"This is more of a novella, a first novel and also longlisted for the Man Booker Prize. Within a list of struggle for my reading, this one surprised me. But not at first. I read the first 100 pages last night and finished it off this morning. It was only in discussion with others that I felt it click into place. I can't say much about it at all because the reading journey is so important, but I can say that all I could see were black, white, and grey (e because the author is English) as I was reading. The world he describes is a dingy, sad, mysterious, colorless place. I don't know how the people living inside of it survive. 
 This is one of two so far I'd keep for the shortlist, but I'm going to keep trying."
4,"7/10: Good solid read, something to get your teeth into. 
 Lovely little historical romance with all the requisite feels. 
 Alice smiled at Forster, and Nick had the entirely irrational thought that he should be the only person in the world to see her dimples. 
 And some light humour. 
 ""You can't mean we are to be completely silent while we . . . that is . . . during the act of congress."" ""Not completely silent. Short exclamations of the imperative variety and breathy moans are encouraged. The words Yes, Nick, right there and Oh God, yes, don't stop are allowed."" ""Oh."" 
 Oh, and a little bit of naughty. 
 Nick always did love a woman who spoke directly to his cock."
1,"I really did not like this one at all. I hate giving one star reviews, but I really can't find any reason to rate it higher. Nothing really happened in this book. I really couldn't stand half of the characters, and honestly I was kinda of confused for at least half of this. There were so many concepts thrown into this book, that it just made it really hard to follow. I'm really bummed because the concept was interesting, but the execution was horrible."
5,"Could not put this one down. 
 This one has been on my kindle for quite a while and so I finally started it and a few hours later found I had finished it and was buying the other two in the series. I am actually glad I waited to read it so all the books would be out because they do end in a cliff hanger. 
 Sela experienced a brutal assualt when she was 16, one that went unsolved due to the drug they used on her that messed up her memories. 10 years later while watching TV Sela sees a man who she knows from her nightmares/memories is one of the men that raped her. Now she is on a quest to get close to him, find out the names of the other two men, and then kill him. 
 Sela never expected to run into Beck her rapist business partner and she also never dreamed she would find herself in a relationship with him, now she must decide which is more important vengence or love. 
 I love Sela and Beck. This s a great story and yes it ends in a cliff hanger but do not fret you can go get Sugar Rush right away and finish it (which also ends in a cliff hanger)."
3,"Although The Unfinished Life of Addison Stone is a work of fiction, you will feel as if Addison's life and death are very real, indeed. The premise is that after the tragic, gone-too-soon, accidental death of 18 year-old phenom superstar of the art world, Addison Stone, real-life author, Adele Griffin, goes on a quest to gather scoop from all that knew her in hopes of gathering enough information to write a book. When you read The Unfinished Life of Addison Stone, you are reading that book. Told chronologically from many POVs, the book is divided into chapters that represent a stage of Addison's life. Within those chapters, the many different people from her life tell their bits of her story. Her artwork, emails, magazine interviews, and photographs are interspersed through the book. It reads a bit like a mystery because you want to find out the details leading up to the accident and if it was really an accident at all. The mystery aspect falls a bit flat and it took me longer to read than I expected. Other than that, I do recommend this book. It is completely unique and the artwork and photography are gorgeous and fascinating. I put this on a graphic novel shelf, it's isn't, really. It's more of an illustrated book. Reminded me of Chopsticks by Jessica Anthony."
5,This was my favorite book sometime so long ago I can't remember when it was. I've been carting around a copy of the book ever since and decided to reread it before I passed it on. And was surprised by how wonderful the story still is! Made me tear up at the end....
5,"I totally love it I'm such a loss of words to write a review :)) 
 (view spoiler)[ but I did remember Derek and Lucy's making love was one of the most beautiful thing I'd read lately. It seems like ages since I read the first making love between hero and heroine with 'I love you' been said so romantically. *sigh* That says a lot about my reading quality nowadays (hide spoiler)] 
 Oh, one thing to say, the author seemed to want Derek and Lucy being a romantic case as in enemy became lovers considering how they opposed each other at first, but I found the bantering between Jane and Garrett won the first place of 'the opposite battles'. Not that I complain. 
 Now I can't wait to read Jane and Garrett's story. I do hope they'll be together!"
4,"""Dave BURNett, Dave BURNett. Have you burned the school down yet?"" 
 Wow. This book is definitely a roller coaster of emotions. It's soo funny at times but so heartbreaking at others. I also really liked the many references to movies, books and music. Like when David compared himself and Steven to Voldemort and Harry Potter and many more Matrix, Crash Bandicoot, Harry Potter etc references. My favorite one was the reference to Evanescence which is my favorite band of all time! 
 Even though there are a lot of typos in it, after you read the story and the acknowledgments you will know why. These mistakes and the writing make the story so much better. All in all, a very good book about kids that are struggling with a lot of different things and try to cope."
5,"At first, I thought this was just another sexy second chance romance book, but I was so wrong, it is more about mental health and self-help? Well-written, funny, touching, I finished this book in one sitting, and really recommend it."
3,"I like the scenes written about the rival wars between drug lords in the ugly world of crime. I can believe it is that exciting, that intoxicating, and that dangerous. 
 Somehow, I am thankful I never have to experience all these in my safe hometown."
4,"Interesting, different, and original. Seriously, I've never read a book with an idea like this, and it's done so well, too. So much honest feeling. 
 (Showcased in Best YA Books of 2013, 18 Amazing Paranormal Books, and Top Ten Tuesday: Hidden YA Fantasy Gems)"
0,I want to read the discworld books *in order.*
4,"I honestly didnt expect this book to be as good as it turned out to be! I grudgingly bought it because every where I turned in book shops I saw it. There's no denying the cover is gorgeous and I consoled myself with the fact that, if I didnt like it, it would at least look good on my shelf! I didnt like it...I loved it! The culture in this book is what makes it stand out I think, as well as an original take on the whole zombie/undead phenomenon that seems to be emerging in the YA literature. The loves story wasnt dragged out or over dramatised with unecessary angst, and the family in this book added to the story, rather than mentioned at the beginning and forgotten throughout the rest of the book. 
 The character development was brilliantly done, we got to watch Kate grow and mature, and deal with the death of her parents, with the support of her family, and of course Vincent. 
 So, I ended up loving this book, and cannot wait for the next one! Definately reccomend!!"
3,"Picking up a few months after the end of Under the Never Sky, Aria and Perry have had to adjust to their new situations. Aria, newly orphaned, is being blackmailed by Consul Hess to find the Still Blue and practicing her fighting skills while Perry is learning the tasks of a blood lord. Love is strained, loyalty is questioned, trust issues, lack of faith, more Aether storms, danger at every turn. All the answers point to the Still Blue. Can they find the Still Blue or will they die trying? 
 I enjoyed Through the Ever Night much more than Under the Never Sky. There was more action and a more intense plot. I like the new characters introduced. I love how the story is reminiscent of the Native Americans. This book was really unpredictable (which I liked). The writing was descriptive and enticing. The setting of the book was so pretty and fascinating. The dual POV worked much better in this book because the two main characters were apart for most of the book. The human behavior in this book was spot on, accurate and realistic. I was surprised by how well Rossi depicted the village people and their personalities. 
 I missed the Aria and Perry moments. I missed them being together. They were apart for most of the book so it left the book lacking romance. 
 This book was a big improvement over ""Under the Never Sky."" It was good, not great though. Besides that, I liked this sequel and can't wait for Into the Still Blue!"
5,This was such a sweet tender-hearted romance - I cried tears of sorrow and worry and then tears of happiness!
4,"It took me nearly a month to read Valor, which has nothing to do with my reading experience and more to do with the fact that I had library books that had to be read and returned first. Valor picks up right where Malice ended. The realm is in a state of chaos as some parties surge in power while other simply try to stay alive. This series is very compelling and engaging. It's rare for me to find books with characters who I absolutely love (Brina) just as much as characters who I absolutely hate (Jael). At this point, the ""evil"" side seems much more complex with a lot of scheming and potential for betrayal. This makes it the more interesting side and has the perspectives that I want to read from. There are so many things that could happen within in the ""evil"" side, and I'm excited to see just what John Gwynne has planned. On to book 3!"
3,"** spoiler alert ** 
 I hate Rick and I'm so glad he's gone. Sort of. I get the feeling he is going to pop back up all the time."
5,Who's got two thumbs & is sobbing into her pillow? This girl.
5,This book was very original and creative. I loved it!
3,"I read Jane Eyre during my early primary school years (aged 9 to be exact. Much to my mothers frustration my reading comprehensive age was about 13 years older than I was. I say frustration because I wanted to read books probably too old for me psychologically - I did NOT want to read Dick and Dora and was not interested in seeing Spot run!). 
 I LOVED it. Of all the classics it is in my top 3. 
 So it's surprising that it took me another 33 years to read Wide Sargasso Sea. And I kind of understand why it took Jean Rhys so long to write it. It just didn't quite gel as a prequel. I think fans of Jane Eyre fall in love with the premise - who was the madwoman in the attic and how did she get to that point in her life. It's a story we want to hear. 
 While the itself book was well written it is hard to view it in isolation from the original Jane Eyre story - especially where existing characters such as Rochester come in. Undoubtedly it would be difficult to write another's character when they are of such fame and well known and Rhys makes a fair effort - but for the most part he does not ring true. Of course, people (or characters) change over time - but the job of the author is to make that change feel authentic. 
 I felt that Antoinette's descent into madness seemed a little too quick - though in fact it did happen over years, the short narrative made it seem much quicker. But likewise I would not have wanted to book to drag out any longer. 
 Over all - it I liked the story well enough but I didn't LOVE it. It is on many ""books to read before you die"" lists and it's the type of book you read for school as opposed to pure enjoyment. 
 It hit the halfway mark for me - 2.5 stars but out of love and respect for my beloved Jane Eyre, I shall round up to 3."
1,Got about 80 pages in before I tossed it. Too vulgar for my tastes. I also think Jim Butcher does the whole ancient gods/spirits in the modern world thing better.
5,"5* because: I kept reading all the way through, I laughed (a LOT, and at things that I sometimes felt a bit shocked at myself for laughing at), and I liked some of the parts of the ending a lot. 
 Also, Jorg as a character. Genuinely different from many others. I'd hazard a guess that many other people, like me, hugely enjoyed the road-weary, practical wisdom that Jorg brought to a lot of situations. It somehow seemed to encompass both a 15-year-old's reckless unpredictability AND a mentor's wry lessons, learned over decades. (view spoiler)[I literally just realized as I typed that, that Jorg was also the grizzled mentor character. I like that! (hide spoiler)] 
 In any case, a recommended end to the series!"
2,"Already itching for a re-read to see what I'd missed. But that won't be productive. And I wanna be productive. But I'll re-read this one soon. Hopefully. *Promise to self* 
 *A minor rant: 
 Let's see: A revenge-seeking thought-to-be-strong-and-capable-but-not weakling, Shahrzad, who can't even committ to her goals for once (which kinda reminded me of Em in All Our Yesterdays), catches the murderous king's attention for no reason, at least none that makes sense. The king spares her because she tells him a story and leaves it hanging, which intrigues him so much killing her is no longer in his best interests, while knowing the end of the story is. 
 Yeah right. Like that makes sense. 
 The whole book made absolutely no sense to me. Even the explanation to such a damnable act of slaughter barely made sense. Uhmm... (view spoiler)[So why do you even spare her if the whole freaking point of killing all those other innocent damsels is to end the curse??? (hide spoiler)]. The sense?????? Is it made??? NO. 
 And yeah I am well aware of how I keep using ""not make sense"" and ""make no sense"". Because there isn't any making of the sense. Duh. 
 *Rant, which made no sense, is over. 
 Marvelous writing tho."
4,"so sweeeeeeeetttttt.. this was the perfect ending for this couple. they've been one of my favorites characters in this series and it was really great to be able to read about their life after full meassures. they really grew up a LOT and even though Josh was a little bit slower, he was so sweet and perfect annnnnnnd can I pleaseeeee find one of those in my life? sigh."
4,"Angelfall tells the story of Penryn and her family (consisting of her mother and younger sister) navigating their way through a post apocalyptic society where angels are mankind's biggest enemy and crime runs rampent. One night, as they are attempting to move to a safer area, Penryn spies Raffe in a battle with a group of angels and attempts to help him. In the midst of all this, Penryn's siter is taken by one of the angels an dher mother flees. In an attempt to get her sister back, Penryn pulls Raffe to safety in hopes that he can help her find her sister. 
 This is such an awesome debut novel from Susan Ee! It's an intriguing mix of romance, war, suspense, and horror/gore. The characters are all great. Penryn is strong and smart. She's only seventeen, but she's been forced to grow up fast because of her mother's mental problems, her sisters paralysis, and the war that the angels have brought to her world. You'd expect her to be disillusioned, and she is, but she still has spark, determination, and a asense of humor. The girl can definitely hold her own! Raffe is not your typical angel(none of these angels are). He's beautiful and tough, but no one would describe him as sweet or angelic. Aside from that, there are a whole host of intriguing side characters. The pace of the story is great. There was never a dull moment. The writing and desciptions are top notch. I had no trouble visualizing the world Penryn was living in. I love the relationship between Penryn and Raffe and the strange one between Penryn and her mother. The ending was terrific, but left me screaming at the fact that I have to wait to see how the journey continues. I'm so glad I stumbled across this book and I can't wait for the next one!"
5,Really good book! Enjoyed it a lot!! Could read it again and again!!! 4.5/5
4,"I always hate ending a series that you really enjoy. Love the ending, but wish there was more. All I can say... is what a shock."
2,"Nope, nope, nope. This one just totally did not work for me. I was mostly disturbed the entire time I was reading and no, not because of the dead animals."
5,"AMAZING BOOK. It is definitely a new favorite. I loved the retelling aspects, the characters, the world -- even the villain was deliciously evil. I loved it! 
 I HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE. (Well...maybe anyone ages 15&up)"
5,"There is something about Tokein's writing style which makes you feel as if you are reading a long lost legend. A fantastic read, interspered with beautiful dialogue and reflection. 
 Unable to resist comparison to the movie however I would have liked the stories to be more entwined. I liked that the movie flashed between the different paths that were taken upon the breaking of the fellowship. The book instead used book three to focus on Aragon and company and book four to focus of Frodo and company."
4,"The Last Colony feels like a very different novel than both it's predecessors. While Old Man's War and The Ghost Brigades spent a large portion of their page count taking the reader through the different departments of the giant shooting gallery that is the universe, this third entry into the series has a much more centralized focus, keeping our attention almost entirely set on one single planet. There's very little in the way of star-hopping in this novel, nor do we have whole sections devoted to battles that have little to no bearing on the story. And I'm ok with that. (Though I did really enjoy those parts of the books.) 
 Interestingly, though the central focus of this novel is much smaller, the scope of its story is far greater than the previous entries' tales. We're reading about something that literally and largely affects all of known space. There's plenty of great character moments as well as an epic storyline, and neither is compromised for the other. It gives the novel a great blend of intimacy and grandeur that I really enjoyed and I thought was executed surprisingly well. 
 The change of pace may be off-putting for fans of the series, I know it was for me at first, but the exchange of large scale warfare with large scale politics was surprisingly acceptable once I got into the book. The story offers an interesting and entertaining look at what colonization is like in this universe. Admittedly, I did miss Scalzi's creatively designed aliens and learning about the appearance and culture of the many different races he creates, though it's not completely missing here. 
 Please don't get the wrong idea about this novel. It's light on action, yes, but I think it serves to make the book stronger in certain ways. Since they pop up much less frequently, action scenes feel more special. We're not ""taste fatigued"" because there's a new action scene every thirty pages. That, combined with Scalzi's ability to write action scenes (their scarcity here certainly isn't due to him forgetting how to write them), makes the climax of the book a real treat of intensity, creativity, and ""oh crap"" moments. 
 If there's anything that I hold against this book, and anything that Scalzi seems to consistently struggle with, it's the ending. Not the resolution, mind you (or at least not all of it), but the final sentences of the book. They feel cheep and cheesy to me. In hindsight, the slight qualm with them I have is hardly anything other than a minor complaint, but it did lead to me finishing the novel with a bad taste in my mouth. As any comedian knows, you've got to start strong and you've got to end strong. If you don't, you can end up souring the entire experience for the reader. Fortunately, that's not what happened here, but I thought it worth mentioning. 
 While not quite as good as the other books in the series, The Last Colony is still an incredibly strong novel. There's nothing majorly wrong with the book, but it lacks certain things that made the others as great as they were. Namely, the lack of creative and imaginative diversity that was so prominent at the series' start. Still, this is an excellent read and well worth it for OMW fans."
2,"A futuristic dystopian Cinderella story. Poor but independent, headstrong girl meets prince (in a selection process curiously reminiscent of Hunger Games) and falls for him after realizing previous biases were false. But of course we don't know for sure if she really gets her HEA, because this is yet another first book in a dystopian YA series. And of course, there is the requisite love triangle. Wow, break the mold already."
4,"Now this is what I am talking about! This book is so far the best in the series that I've read. This is supposedly book 4 in the Dark-Hunter series, but since 
 Fantasy Lover 
 , the supposed first book in the series, makes no mention of the Dark Hunters etc, I consider this book really being number 3. 
 But that is just me being anal, nitpicky and cranky. 
 Zarek was introduced in book 2(or 3) Night Embrace and almost ran away with the book, imo. He is feared, hated, mean, nasty and surprisingly not as evil as he's made out to be, natch. Kenon could have amped up the puppy dog factor to redeem him overly to make him into an acceptable romance novel hero, but, luckily, she doesn't. She does make him sympathetic to some degree, but not too much to take away the best part of what makes him so memorable in the first place. 
 And this book stands head and shoulders above the other by giving a heroine who is interesting and resonates with the hero. There wasn't anything bad about Sunshine, Amanda and Gracie, but they tended to blend in the background in the face of their better written heroes. Astrid, otoh, is much better realized and much better written. 
 I don't know what it is but like Zsadist in Ward's Black Dagger series, Zarek just does it for me. Maybe I just like tortured underdogs who in the end triumph is spades."
3,"3.5 Stars 
 It's been a long time since a book has kept me up to an ungodly hour before I had to work the next day. 
 This will be a very short review as I feel everything in the book was pretty straight-forward. 
 Alice Love loses her memory (10 years of it , to be exact) after an unfortunate accident in her Friday Step-Class. After the incident occurs , Moriarty takes us on a journey with Alice to retrieve her memories. 
 Even though I found Alice to be a likeable character , she didn't really have much about her for me to relate to or respect. That might have made her a bit boring. Also maybe it's just because I don't have kids and can't imagine what it takes to raise the little shit-heads? 
 Let's just be real here as well. It's OK for people to change. Just because you are a different person now doesn't mean there's anything wrong with the current you. Our personalities change to deal with certain circumstances in life and I personally consider that a good thing. Guess that's just me. 
 (view spoiler)[ The sister's infertility becomes such a big part of this story , but I really never saw the point of it other than to add a bit of spice and maybe a different perspective to a very simple plot. Maybe something the author went through and wanted to add to the story for personal reasons? 
 I was a bit disappointed in the sister's happy-ending story and that may sound cruel , but just hear me out. Not only would it have been a great revelation of self for Elizabeth to accept and understand that she and Ben could have had a happy life without kid's , it would also have been a better strategy to Moriarty's story. I recommended this book to my aunt (who is in her 40's and has spent thousand's on IVF) and I'm very happy she hasn't read it yet , because the cruel truth of the matter is that not everyone has the happy ending Elizabeth has had. Needless to say I'll be pushing many a other book in her face to distract her from this one. (hide spoiler)] 
 Anyway. 
 A fairly predictable ending , but what I wanted so I'm not going to complain too much. 
 I didn't cry , I didn't really laugh. I just read the book and went on with life. 
 Would recommend the book to anyone really but probably more relate-able to older women with families. 
 As a side note ; I really have to stop thinking just because a book is compulsively readable , that makes it a fantastic book."
4,"I mean, obviously Leia's going to try to save the last of the Alderaanians, right? I can't believe it took (someone?..anyone?) so long to write a story about Leia trying to save the last of her people. It makes sense in every way and helps to fill this gap between the girl who gets captured in 'A New Hope' to that badass lady who dresses up like a bounty hunter to save Han later."
4,"This was a freebie offered at Audible last October. I finally got around to listening to it this morning and it was a fabulous little Halloween gifted to us from author Neil Gaiman. Sadly, I don't think it's available even for purchase at this time but if you stumble across it somewhere it's worth a listen. 
 It was a creepy little tale read wonderfully by the author. It's about a little boy who asks the narrator to tell him a scary bedtime story. Instead he ends up spooking the older boy (and the reader). Though only 12 minutes long it manages to create a slowly building chill that might have you turning on all the lights before going to bed."
5,"The beginning of this book was long and a bit slow, but after that it really picked up and I loved it. I loved the characters a lot, and the setting... I loved the story. I loved the little surprises. The last twenty pages had a long 'this is the end of the story' kind of feeling to it, which made the ending drag out forever. Even still, it's beatifully written and a lovely story. Though, I'm not sure if the book really fits into the 'dystopian' category..."
4,"Some really good advice about writing, bracketed by extensive and irrelevant autobiography."
4,"So this was a lot of fun. I really like Opal, and Kade, and even Pazia. I love Ixia and Sitia and I just want Snyder to keep writing more books set there. 
 Opal is a great protagonist. Very different from Yelena. Unsure of herself, doubting her own abilities, and afraid to let anyone get close because of what she did to Yelena and what happened to her sister. Like Yelena, she has some dark memories in her past, and some old ghosts haunting her that she'll have to deal with before she can reach her true potential. 
 The glass workshop is such a great setting that's not used often enough in fiction. I remember being fascinated by the glass-blowing room at my high school, but I never actually made anything with glass, something I regret now. I love that the heat and noise are like home to Opal, and that she takes her strength from her skills with glass. 
 This book wasn't very well proofread/edited, which always annoys me because that's such an easy fix. There were a lot of periods where there should have been commas and vice versa. Maybe this is fixed in other editions, I don't know. But seriously, book publishers, don't do a rush job editing your books. It's just lazy. 
 I'm looking forward to reading the other books in this series. I hope they explore the glass magic thing more, because there still isn't an explanation for why Opal can only work magic using glass, or how Ulrick can use magic to make his pieces but not for anything else. After the great explanations of how Yelena's magic works in the Study series, I have faith that Snyder will think of a brilliant explanation for Opal's magic, too. 
 Snyder knows how to keep her readers interested, that's for sure. It's a fun ride."
5,"BRILLIANTLY WRITTEN!!! ALL MY STARS ARE FOR YOU MS QUINN! 
 Prior to reading the book, i was already swamped with the impression that 'Romancing Mr.Bridgerton' is the most-favorite installment of the Bridgertons. Yup, almost every Hr-Quinn fan I know has come to admit and as much as I love being the opposing party (do not ask hahaha), they were all right and how I wish I could run up and hug everyone who recommended this beauty of a story to me. Now, at this moment, I truly am confused on what to recommend to a non HR friend whenever you are trying to convince someone to dive in the genre, because this book might have actually surpassed my all time fave--Love in the afternoon by .1--okay then, they are tied! But you see, this book has disrupted my normal way of living because clearly I woke up extremely late for work the day after I finished reading this and my eyes swelled up beyond normal and and and my heart just burst into a million magical pieces. This book was a perfect blend of friendship, family, romance, passion and sincerity all rooted out of love. I feel extremely lucky to have shared this story and my only regret is that I read this when everybody was already done with it because I am now pacing in circles, frantically searching for someone who can take in my barrel of emotions. Oh goodness, in short I truly truly love this book and I treasure this story with all my heart. 
 And so we have come to everybody's favorite Bridgerton brother, Colin. Come on, from book 1-anybody could ordinarily deduce that Colin is bound to be one f e most fave's hero, ever. His charm, his wit and his overall personality just radiates and you could really feel that aside from his brooding, roguish looks he's got the charm and personality--and it gets better because Colin isn't the brattish, douche kind of a man. He was simply perfect. I loved his lines all through out the book and come on people, this man's honesty is just beyond swoon worthy. I loved how natural and spontaneous Colin is with the people around him. 
 Then here comes Penelope, the most selfless heroine I have ever met. We can see Penelope's transformation from -12 years back to the present and I love how her character is such a brave soul hidden beneath the facade of a wallflower. I also loved her humility and her being giving to people that she loves. But despite al that she maintains that spunk that makes her a truly lovable heroine. She emanates with grace and for me, she truly is beautiful. I wonder if it is indeed true that no one as courted her, not even an old dying gentleman. That just seemed impossible. Anyway, if there was a heroine worth of a truly wonderful HEA, it would be Penelope. She might have even deserved her heaven in earth. 
 Okay so now that I have expressed my love for my h/h, I first must ask... Where is the food? Hahahaha oh those who have read would know! ;) 
 So we begin with the wonderful story of Penelope and Colin. At first, a part of me was a bit frustrated with Colin's ease with Penelope because a part of me thought that he might have loved Penelope way baaaack because the former books have eagerly mentioned Colin dancing with Penelope but guess I was wrong because we see our Penelope very in love with Colin for the past 12 years since their first meeting and since then, she has only had her heart for Colin who only saw her as a friend. But I am so glad that Julia Quinn's magic in weaving a great story made Penelope's dream come true when slowly, in careful and very meaningful ways we see Colin actually falling in love with Penelope and that was when I knew that my heart would never be the same. Truly, I loved the way Colin has learned every bit of Penelope along the way and nevermind Whistledown (I actually didn't mind haha) because when Colin knew that his love for this woman who has loved him for so long has already developed, he was in it too deep and it was more of the point of return and god I loved it. Anyone here who disagrees that his love confession for Penelope wasn't the sweetest would have to meet me outside my house in exactly 10 minutes cause... cause...I would plead and beg and beg some more for you to agree with him because I swear my tears were just unstoppable. UNSTOPPABLE, yes, they could not be stopped. Sigh. 
 ""And he realized that her expression held not one trace of expectation. She hadn't told him she loved him simply to hear his reply. She wasn't even waiting for his answer."" 
 ""I love you too. He whispered..."" 
 Oh god, if I love you's could kill, man I am gazillion times dead okay!! Ugh. And just when I thought I read the best thing ever, something as good came up... 
 ""And getting my work published ... well, it doesn't hold a candle to my real dream, 
 which is spending the rest of my life with you"" 
 Please, leave me alone. I could not bear it anymore. This book is too good, I am unworthy! 
 And so after contemplating, I have finally realized that this book is beyond special. I loved loved loved loved loved it! Highly highly highly recommended! Go go go please read it. I am begging begging begging you!! 
 But can I ask one last time? Where's the food? Hahaha 
 P.s. 
 I have also deduced that I have a weakness for 'I have loved you for so long' stories cause at the moment my top 3 Hr's are Love in the afternoon, A lady by midnight and Romancing Mr. bridgerton! 
 P.s.s.s.s.s 
 Could somebody help me cause I don't feel too excited about Eloise's story? :("
5,"I loved it! Really really good. The first thing I want to say is that I really love how this book was set up. It really helped to make this book great. The story was also really good. I got so absorbed in this book that I felt like I was right there with them. That rarely happens even with some other books I love. Another thing that rarely happens was that I actually cried with this book with actual tears coming down. Of course I do get sad with other books, but they rarely come down. This book was sad, but I still like it. Really amazing book. Well I really can't say anymore than I already did so I suggest to just read it to find out how great it is."
4,I would have given this book five stars save for how big a jerk Harry is towards the beginning of the book. I appreciate a man who goes after what he wants and to a degree I understood why he did what he did. But he still does something intentionally hurtful towards the heroine and it took me a while to like him again. The hotel staff are wonderful and seeing the Hathaway family again together is always fun. I'm curious if there's further installments to this series who it will feature. The end of this books gives a cliffhanger of sorts that perhaps hints at this but I'm not sure. Tempt Me at Twilight was still an enjoyable read as a whole though and a good addition to the series.
3,"Good: 
 * Overwhelming British slang and usage. 
 * Amusing use of language. 
 * Low-stakes, gentle conflict. 
 Bad: 
 * The conflict is too low-stakes and gentle. Nothing ever seems to have much emotional resonance, even things which really should. There's a constant baseline freaking-out level, but nothing seems to be more important than anything else. Lucy's feelings about her best friend having a new best friend are about equal to her feelings about having a lousy school assignment or getting a bad haircut. 
 It would be an amusing statement about teenagerhood if all these things were equal because they were all MAXIMUM BAD, the end of the world, but they're not; Lucy is just sort of... I don't know... flummoxed by it all. It's not a story that makes you feel anything. I guess it's because it's supposed to be a light chick-litty type comedy, but, I mean, there's emotional material to work with there. 
 (view spoiler)[Like: when Lucy gets upset because after Tony shows interest in her, she overhears Nesta telling Tony to stay away from her. THAT COULD BE GOOD STUFF! I really wish we'd seen more of a reaction from Lucy--more anger, more vitriol. Come on! She stole your best friend and now she's stealing your man! Don't just stand around making pleasant conversation with her and then feel unwarrantedly guilty for not liking her enough and invite her over for ice cream to talk it out and find out like ten pages later that Nesta was just trying to protect Lucy and be totally BFF and there's still so much of the book left to go. 
 * [Also weird: Lucy SORT OF ends up with Tony at the end? I mean he kisses her again in a postclimactic epilogue type chapter. It's weird because part of the moral seems to be that this boy is not good enough for Lucy and yet she still gets him in the happy ending.] (hide spoiler)] 
 * In addition to the frustrating lack of milking emotional moments, surface plot elements were also underused, including the titular inflatable bra--which is just an aside and not even anything embarrassing happens with it--and an egg project! The girls have an egg project! And it isn't even important to the plot! COME ON GIVE ME A GOOD JUICY EGG PROJECT STORY. 
 * Structure and hierarchy problems. Things don't seem to happen for any real reason. Lucy just sort of feels things and then doesn't. 
 Part of the problem is that there are two main sources of conflict which are not really related (or not really shown to be related). On the one side, there's a three's-a-crowd situation with Lucy's friend's new friend, feelings of inadequacy for being small and having small boobs (SIGH), and the hopeless chase after a hot boy. On the other, there's Lucy's feelings that she has no special talent, and she doesn't know what she'll do with her future. She sort of alternately angsts about one and then the other, and it's hard to tell which the book is about. I'm not saying a book can't be complex and have many issues, but I wanted one or the other to be dominant, or for them to be overtly related. 
 * Telling vs. showing issues. Specifically, characters are way too emotionally aware. People are always solving things once and for all by having frank yet vague discussions about their true feelings, which is always the mark of story which doesn't know how to resolve itself. 
 * Astrology. Blech. Lots of teen girl books have astrology and it's just boring. 
 Not Sure How I Feel About It: 
 * I actually like the ""What is my talent?"" angst. I think THIS VERY KIND OF FICTION tends to further the idea that everyone has One True Calling and that their true skill will manifest at adolescence, like there are always characters in these kinds of books who are Really Good At Singing or Really Good At Art or Really Good At Writing (the main character!!!!). So it's fun when someone doesn't have that. 
 But Lucy clearly DOES have a special talent, which is sewing and designing clothes. She doesn't realize until the end that this counts. While I like that's blind to her own skills, I don't see why she didn't notice this one. I think it would work better if her talent was something more subtle, like, organizing committees or being reliable, since those are the things you wouldn't notice--not something obviously creative that produces an in-demand product. 
 Also the designing clothes sequences seem a little rushed and/or forced, like they go too smoothly and quickly--written perhaps by someone who WISHES she could sew and not someone who does? Or maybe she was toning it down because she thought long descriptions of the sewing process and mishaps would be boring. I like when these things are highly technical and difficult to understand, but maybe I am in a minority."
5,"UPDATED REVIEW 
 Review to come! Third time's the charm! 
 ********** 
 I really enjoyed rereading this book!"
2,"Ug. I liked the idea of this book, but it didn't come through. I was mostly just kind of bored and didn't really feel much like reading it. The second half, I wanted to know what happened, but mostly just wanted it to be over so I could read something else. So yeah. That's done."
4,"I love the worldbuilding in this series. The romance didn't do it for me this time (sorry) but I loved, loved, LOVED where the arrows are heading in an organizational and political way. Which is where the rating and the enjoyment came from this time. The villains didn't read as villainous or smart this time either, but totally worth it. 
 Also? The mirror. Oh. My. God. Aedan, you naughty you! 
 (Note: referring to his special powers, get your mind off the gutter) 
 So, who knows whose book is coming next? I read this one in two days after waiting for a year. I need something else."
4,Spare a few minutes and do yourself a favour. Its funny and might change your pov in a good way.
4,"This is the first book by Ford that I've read, though I think I have a copy of Hotel at the Corner of Bitter and Sweet around somewhere. I really enjoyed it - I liked William, and I liked the narrative going back and forth in time. It helped propel the story along. I loved the historical details - everything about this book was just really well done. The whole thing is, of course, rather sad - every part of it is pretty heartbreaking, but it's a well-written insight into what life was like at that point in time for people like William and Willow. I'll definitely be reading more from Ford in the future."
5,"The Vampire Academy series is one of the most emotionally attached books I've read in a while. I'm a fan of both of Richelle Mead's series and LOVE each of her books. Vampire Academy is a YA series but it really doesn't make me feel age is a factor. They are located in a school and do go through many teenage problems but the way the characters interact and how the author makes you feel for them is on another level. I got attached almost instantly and read each book in only a few hours. 
 In this book Rose is still reeling from the death of her friend Manson.She feels a dark presence in her mind start to grow and is frightened what will happen to her. Once she starts to see Mansons ghost she thinks she has gone crazy. Meanwhile he feeling and connection with Dimitri start to grow. I read this book in one sitting and found it was easy to get emotionally attached. There will be big twists in this one especially around the end which will leave you begging for more. I recommend anyone who hasn't read it, do so. A Richelle Mead book is always a good one! 
 Synopsis 
 Is Rose's fate to kill the person she loves most? It's springtime at St. Vladimir's Academy, and Rose Hathaway is this close to graduation. Since Mason's death, Rose hasn't been feeling quite right. She has dark flashbacks in the middle of practice, can't concentrate in class, and has terrifying dreams about Lissa. But Rose has an even bigger secret . . . .She's in love with Dimitri. And this time, it's way more than a crush. 
 Then Strigoi target the academy in the deadliest attack in Moroi history, and Dimitri is taken. Rose must protect Lissa at all costs, but keeping her best friend safe could mean losing Dimitri forever..."
4,"3.5 stars 
 The characters and the story were still spectacular, but I felt the pacing was off. And sometimes Leigh Bardugo didn't explain the surroundings enough for me to know what was happening. Like if I hadn't read the Six of Crows duology first, I don't think I would have enjoyed Shadow and Bone quite so much. She's definitely grown in her introducing the reader to the world skill. But, anyway, I do like that Alina is imperfect. She isn't even imperfect in the Robin Hood way. She's actually struggling to do the right thing--not just doing the right thing the right way."
4,"There is a feeling I get when reading certain books that I enjoy immensely, and Muriel Spark's The Driver's Seat is perhaps the best at evoking it in me. It is the feeling of being very invested in, yet slightly disturbed by a story and therefore tending towards distancing myself from it. This book is not creepy or scary, nor very disturbing, but rather unsettling and discomfiting. It's almost best described with a facial expression rather than words-a kind of disconcerted cringe. 
 The Driver's Seat is a short novel, clocking in at 117 pages on the copy I read-perfect for a single-sitting cringe-fest. It's a compact tale of a misfit traveler who meets her fate on an ominous and self-destructive journey."
1,"I should know I'm not going to like a book when it claims to be ""Harry Potter for adults "". Grossman ' s complete disregard for Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia( among others ) that I and mutiple others charish is horrific. According to Grossman, the only people who like such drivel as the books metioned above, are of such nativity that they can't possibly understand the wonders of ""The Magician'. As one other reviewer mentioned, the protagonist is basically Malfoy before HBP. snotty and uppity."
3,"** spoiler alert ** 
 Not as good as the first one. It was really confusing, with all this stuff about the loops. Was Miss Wren's loop in Miss Peregrine's? Did they go back in time somehow?"
4,"Received a copy from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. 
 The sequel to The Paper Magician, The Glass Magician starts some time after the end of the first book. A little more action-packed than the first one, The Glass Magician focuses on the search for Lira's murderous colleague, Grath, who seeks to understand the secret of how Ceony managed to stop Lira in The Paper Magician. 
 As there was more going on, and we learned a little bit more about the culture of the magicians' world (but some of my questions from before still have not been answered), I liked this book better than the first one. There was a bit more going on, as well, which may explain how I read it more quickly. We were also introduced to some new characters, such as Ceony's friend Delilah and Langston, one of Emery's former apprentices. I liked that we learned more about some of the other magicial arts. 
 The elephant in the room throughout this book is Ceony's love for Emery, something that he attempts to ignore for a good portion of the story. At this point in their relationship, I can buy their feelings, whereas in the first book it seemed toon for such profound declarations. As it is, it was an important thing to remember, but not the driving force of the plot, which was nice."
3,"On the one hand, it was very entertaining. On the other hand, I found it way too overdramatic. Murder! Robbery! Impersonation! Political intrigue! It's got it all!!"
3,"Malinda Lo has hit it out of the park again. I have to admit that I first thought the subject of the book wouldn't interest me, but right away Lo's engaging writing sucked me in. She works her far-reaching perspective and plot web with great skill, and the story moves along with great pacing. 
 Lo's characters are a cheerfully diverse cast, reflecting my own experience growing up and living in the Bay Area. I was stunned and incredibly pleased by Reese, the main character, who is a hero to be admired for her curiosity, talent, integrity, and emerging adulthood. It was also nice to have some wonderful bisexual visibility - it meant a lot to see my sexuality written of seriously and with great acceptance."
1,"First person narrator is a minus, nonsympathetic fpn is a deal breaker. I made it thirty pages, back to the library."
4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 yayyy i loved the ending to this book. it was perfect! good series and best of all everyone i wanted to be alive stayed alive, ari, janco, leif, yelena's parents, even cahil. and best of all yelena and valek are alive and together. awesome!"
3,"Everyone surely knows the basics of the story by now, but I'll recap: a cargo ship sinks, and all that remains is one lifeboat in the Pacific, inhabited by a hyena, zebra, orangutan, a 450-pound Bengal tiger and sixteen-year-old boy named Pi. 
 As a general rule, I don't read many reviews before reading a book - I usually just scour the ratings to see how books fare when deciding whether to read them - but I came across this one a long time ago, when I first got the book, and it sprung back to mind as I finally got around to reading it. I feel like I'm going to mirror a lot of people who commented it in saying I can't do it as much justice as her. So if you want to spare yourself my attempts, just head over there. 
 I might not have been quite as swept up in it as others have been, but I still couldn't put the book down. It seems a clear-cut story, but between all his background and religious leanings and exploration of ideologies and life, you get to the end and realise there might be one narrative, but there's several different potential meanings. The beauty of Life of Pi is not that you find closure at the end of the book, more that it leaves you to think and try pinpoint your own take on the story. As it stands, I'm still kind of at a loss. 
 But one thing I do enjoy is reading theories on books, whether it's well-read series or one-offs that really stood out, so now I get to delve into further reading to find out just quite how many interpretations of this book there are. 
 It was a generally unexpected twist to find this story was not exactly as I'd expected from years of seeing the movie posters and book covers, but I do like the unexpected."
4,Very funny. I can see why this won last year's Goodreads Choice Award for humor.
3,"This addition to the Kitty Norville series was not as exciting as I was expecting. I've always thought this series to be pretty good about keeping an interesting story, but this one didn't really catch my interest. 
 Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I really don't care so much for Ben. I didn't like how he kept not recognizing Kitty as his fiance in front of his ""hunter"" friends, and it trully felt like he could care less if they ended up getting married or not. 
 The actual idea of what happens in this book it's good, I enjoyed the live Kitty show. Her show is always fun to see. 
 I'll be reading the next book soon and hopefully it's better than this. 
 And on a side note..... I MISS CORMAC."
4,Absolutely delightful!
4,"4 stars 
 LETTING GO by Meg Hart 
 -3.5 stars 
 This was a simple but enjoyable short story, about a 30 something professional woman and and a 28 year old bartender hooking up over a weekend. There is lots of chemistry. Will they take it any further? 
 SEIZE THE NIGHT BY Tiffany Reisz - 4 stars 
 It's a Tiffany Reisz story, therefore the characters are super charismatic, with some of them funny and sarcastic. It's a Romeo & Juliet story, but in modern times and with (view spoiler)[ a happy ending! (hide spoiler)]. The sex scenes are hot, and there is no BDSM! :-) I wouldn't mind reading another story on Merrick, Remi's PA."
2,"Mystic City features a painfully predictable and bland plot, a heroine that has a serious case of Too Dumb To Live, other flat characters, and weak world building. This is a book that can be forgotten about minutes after finishing... if you finish it at all."
2,"Disclaimer: I received a free Advanced Reader's Copy of this book from the publisher for my honest review. 
 Going in, I knew this was getting billed as something ""fans of The Hunger Games would enjoy,"" but no one mentioned just how similar the two books are. Just because I liked (loved!) a particular book, doesn't mean I want to read another one almost exactly like it. If you've already read the book or don't mind spoilers, you'll see what I mean... 
 (view spoiler)[*Instead of the Capital, there is Tosu City. 
 *Instead of districts, there are colonies. 
 *It is considered an honor to be chosen for Testing, but it is actually very dangerous and a lot of participants will die. (I suppose in The Hunger Games, it is not considered an honor in every district, but still.) 
 *The Five Lakes Colony the main character is from is small, and no one believes their testing candidates pose a real threat, just like no one thinks anyone from District 12 could win the Hunger Games. 
 *Instead of the reaping there is Graduation Day. It is a social event in each colony and there is even a female character who gets up on stage and starts by saying, ""Happy Graduation Day."" I could not help but hear an echo of Effie Trinket saying, ""Happy Hunger Games"" when I read that one. Seriously. 
 *The chosen characters must travel to Tosu City to begin and they have not previously seen the world outside their colony. 
 *Although other colonies don't think of Five Lakes as much of a threat, they are actually better prepared for the challenges of Testing. Since they come from a smaller and more remote colony, they have better knowledge of survival skills just like Katniss. Cia has deadly aim with a bow & arrow shotgun. 
 *Before part four of the testing, the candidates have to carefully choose 3 items to bring with them. Everything seems essential, but they have to prioritize and strategize. They didn't have to do battle at the cornucopia for them, but it still sounds awful similar to me. 
 *Some testing candidates kill to better their chances, some form alliances. It's hard to know who to trust. 
 *One night when Cia is alone, she camps up in a tree. 
 *When a testing candidate from another colony is killed, Cia wants to stop and bury her because it is the right thing to do. (This one kind of killed me because the scene with Rue in The Hunger Games pretty much slayed me. This one did not have nearly the same impact.) 
 *One of the other testing candidates from Five Lakes Colony is a boy who Cia hadn't paid much mind to, but who clearly has noticed her and liked her for quite some time. His name is Peeta Tomas. 
 *Tomas gets injured and Cia refuses to leave him behind and nurses him back to health. 
 *There is speculation that the testing officials are rigging the surroundings as part of the test. I don't know about you, but that sounds a lot like the gamemakers to me. 
 And these are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head since I didn't take notes as I was reading... (hide spoiler)] 
 I know that the message/moral/point/lesson of The Testing is different than the message/moral/point/lesson of The Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is all about fighting against a corrupt government (though I can see this might be a direction the story might go in the future) and at least so far, The Testing seems to be making a commentary on the rigors of today's standardized testing. These differences aside, I was starting to feel like this concept about testing was just superimposed over the plot of The Hunger Games! 
 Given all that, a part of me wants to give it 0 stars because these similarities are just insane. On the other hand, I did enjoy reading it even though I found myself shaking my head A LOT and wondering if the author/editor/publisher realized just how similar these books are. Despite my reservations, at no point did I want to stop reading and that does say something in and of itself. I was also really glad there was no love triangle and hopefully it will stay that way throughout the series. I also bumped up my rating because I do feel this book could be setting up for much better sequels. I think there is a lot of promise and this story could take off in its own direction. I am interested enough to know I definitely want to read the sequel and if this were truly a 0 or 1 star book, I would not be inclined to do so. 
 I know there are a lot of people who agree with me, but there are also a lot of others who loved this book (like my bookish buddy Kay from It's a Book Life -- read her 5 star review for a much more positive perspective.) I don't mean to bash this book, I just want to let people know what they are getting themselves into. If I did not have The Hunger Games to compare it to, I'm certain I would have loved it. It boils down to having the shadow of another story hovering over me which knocked this one down quite a few points in my esteem.

5,"Read this review on my blog! 
 In the last installment of Cassandra Clare's bestselling series ""The Mortal Instruments"", Clary and her friends have to save the world (of course!). They still find the time to agonize over their love lives. go shopping for christmas presents... Even when they find themselves quite literally in hell, they still worry about their relationships, one of them even gets drunk. In real life, these guys wouldn't have lasted a day in that war. 
 The writing is not terrible, but it isn't exactly good, either. At one point, Clare compared stalactites to ""electrified icicles"". Ugh. 
 There's no shortage of corny moments, either. I don't want to spoil too much, but at one point a vampire dies because they were tricked into drinking holy water, and their skin peels back until only the bones are left and then those crumble to ash. That's freaking ridiculous, how on earth am I supposed to take that seriously? 
 Most of the kissing scenes were boring and read like something out of a fan-fiction. 
 There's a sex scene, about half-way through the book and I don't like it's handled. I can see why Clare tried to keep it vague, since it still is a YA novel, and you can't put a too explicit sex scene in there. This one's vague enough that it was hard to understand what was going on. I would have preferred it if Clare had made the scene fade to black, like she did in ""Clockwork Princess"". Also, who the hell packs up for Hell and brings condoms along? 
 Yet, in the words of immortal poets Icona Pop, ""I don't care. I love it!"" 
 For all the cheesy and trashy moments, for all the inconsistencies, for all the dumb things the main characters do, I still enjoyed this novel very much. It's a lot of fun, and it kept me hooked (any book that can keep me up until two o'clock twice in a row deserves an honorable mention). 
 The humor is great, as always, and I even caught myself laughing out loud several times. 
 I also don't mind all the relationship drama, despite the fact that it is unrealistic. The only couple I cared about in book five were Magnus and Alec, but this time around I found myself rooting for all of them - Jace and Clary, Izzy and Simon, Jocelyn and Luke... 
 I especially enjoyed the platonic relationships, which were well-developed in this novel. I was glad for the fact that Alec and Jace's friendship and their parabatai bond was expanded upon, since in the previous books almost no details were given about it. 
 Even tough they sometimes did some pretty dumb things, the characters were very likable. Even Alec, whom I have never liked all that much, became much more fun and interesting in this book, as he finally stood up for himself, instead of spending all his time scowling and wallowing in his insecurities. I am now glad that he and Magnus broke up in the last book, having to go through the pain of heart-break made Alec into a much stronger and interesting character. 
 Clary, who in the previous books only had a couple of badass moments and had to be saved more often than not, had some time to train and became an actually skilled warrior. I had fun reading about her, something that didn't happen when I read the previous two books. She's not only powerful, strong and determined. Most of all. she's clever and scheming. I like that in a main character. 
 Despite the fact that I know that this book has flaws, I enjoyed it very much, and I still recommend it, if you're in the mood for something fun and adventurous and you like YA and Urban Fantasy."
3,3.5 stars. Creepy.
5,"I reread this one and loved it even more. It's beautifully written and each chapter has symbols and depth and imagery. Kate and Henry are wonderful. I couldn't remember how it ended and so kept thinking, ""How will this all get resolved?"" It just gets harder and harder for Kate. Blackmoore's gothic architecture enhances the tone and feeling of the book, which is aching and lonely. Seriously beautiful love story."
5,"This story is simply incredible - it's got amazing sci-fi technology, planet missions, global politics and a girl and a robot. I'm giving one of the highest compliments I can: this is one of the only books where a bittersweet ending worked in its favor. I need more!!"
4,"Believe all the reviews. This book is not for the faint hearted. 
 In a way, it put me into an abuse comfort zone if that makes sense - maybe only to others with abuse in their background? Sort of the opposite of reading a feel good romance - more ""I remember this. This is familiar - I know this world"". 
 The book is drugged soaked, but that is the least of its triggers. 
 I'll be reflecting on what the point of the book is."
5,"** spoiler alert ** 
 OMG what? I wanted to read this before I read Boundless, so I'm like : ""I need to know what's happening next. NOW."" 
 ""It's a decision I will always regret."" FUCK."

 This is one of the best MPREG shifter books I have read so far. It was interesting and explanatory 
 I loved the characters, the plot and the settings. 
 Kit 
 My heart broke for all the stuff he went trough, the pain, the lost, the humiliation it all broke my poor heart in pieces. Through it all he had hope so much hope and love. He was this amazing uncomplicated soul. 
 Luca 
 Well he and I had a love / hate relationship going on at one stage. First I thought the world of this guy you know? Then I wanted tho kill the bastard for what he put Kit through during the second choosing ceremony... I couldn't believe he did that..... Okey he made up for it but still ...."
4,Read this in high school and loved it.
2,"Heartless is a prequel of a sorts to Alice in Wonderland, which follows the Queen of Hearts before she becomes queen. How she loses her heart and compassion, and starts chopping peoples heads off. This is technically not a spoiler, since we all know that the Queen of Hearts is a b***, right? 
 There are lots of references to the original story, and also to Poe's Raven; I did enjoy those the most I think! They were cleverly done, though a bit repetitious. 
 Overall, though, I am... Disappointed is too harsh, but underwhelmed perhaps? I don't know... I just felt disconnected from the story and the characters; I couldn't really bring myself to care about anyone other than the cat. Cath's (the queen) journey from sweet-to-sour felt too sudden, too ""what just happened??"" for me to buy it. The romance was quite bland as well, unfortunately. It's frustrating because I LOVE the Lunar Chronicles! And I was hoping, no expecting (!), to be blown away again. 
 And I wasn't. 
 I just have to accept that this sort of whimsical, nonsensical, anything-can-happen-and-will-because-nothing-abides-to-any-rules is just not my cup of tea at all. 
 I do not even like Alice in Wonderland after all."
3,"Well....I really wanted to love it but...... more of a 3.5 to 4 stars. 
 I am so bummed I didn't fall in love with it. Don't get me wrong, I loved Kash and Sour Patch together, loved a lot of the back&forth between them. I am relieved I waited to read this once the 2nd book was coming out since I was warned about ""An Awful Cliffhanger"" and I would have hated to wait too long after it. Ok so here it goes.... 
 (view spoiler)[First off what an awful BestFriend, I dont care if he is your cousin you dont just look the other way when your BESTFRIEND accuses him of something so serious and the whole would not drop the subject of her going out with him in the first place, ugh! And locking her out especially after she knew she was attacked?? Remove her BF card NOW. 
 It just felt so unbelievable, too much happened. And what the fuckery fuck was up with him just proposing....really??? I guess ::MajorEyeRoll:: . (hide spoiler)] 
 I really did want to love it, I mean I lOVE Molly. I will definitely read the 2nd book, hopefully it sums it all up and I can love the series as a whole....:)."
0,"DNF... I don't do this often but I just couldn't go on... 
 I'm sure I'll finish it eventually, mainly because I bought the box set. UGH."
4,"To be frank, I didn't like the high fantasy dream parts. High fantasy isn't my thing, so I found myself tempted to skip these segments. I really enjoyed all the characters, though, including Barbie. I found myself on the verge of tears for the last few pages, but I had to hold them back since I was working."
5,"Gwendolyn, man. I almost love her as much as I love Alana"
5,"Let it be known that I am slightly ashamed of the fact that it took me basically three days to read a 223 page story but anyways, onto the review. 
 I did not expect this book to be so good. It has been on my tbr for a good 3 years now and for some reason I just never wanted to pick it up but lo and behold a Valentine's themed reading challenge came up and I decided that it just might be the perfect time to check it out. 
 I'd like to say that I was immediately invested in Paul and his friends. They were all so relatable, so familiar to me and I adored each and every one of them, except for Chuck, I honestly just sort of dealt with him- but Infinite Darlene!!!!!! She is Queen. Honestly, she embodies everything I want to be- she is so much more sure of herself than I am and she believes in this possibility that there are infinite possibilities and I love that about her. 
 Not to be too spoilery, my status updates are spoiler-filled enough but I just want to say that the romances, ending, and overall book itself were amazing. Go read it now, please- 
 you'll thank me later."
4,"This is a book any dog lover will enjoy. That is if they also enjoy thriller/mystery books. 
 A traumatized police officer and a traumatized war dog (German Shepherd Maggie) help each other get back to full life while working on the case that killed the officer's partner. 
 This sounds sappy but is not. It occasionally shows the dog's point of view and it is as canine as one could wish. This is nothing like the Rita Mae Brown series where the animals sound like little people talking to each other. Having had to learn something about how dogs think in order to manage a boisterous pack at our house, this book felt really ""true."" 
 The mystery is, as many reviewers have noted, telegraphed early on and, frankly, for me that was the least interesting part of the book. However, I appreciated the way that Crais added touches of humanity to characters who usually are handled in a stock fashion. The small time criminal's grief over his brother's death comes to mind especially. 
 The real story though is that of Scott and Maggie, each equally tough and vulnerable and needing a new pack in order to survive. 
 I was going to give this three stars but it has stuck with me to the point where I was recommending it to a gentleman who brought his Chihuhua to the grocery store today. I can do no less than give it a star for memorability."
5,"Considering how long this series is, and with at least one more book coming, I'm surprised at how well Rachel Caine has been able to maintain it. Each book contains a stand-alone story while adding to the rest of the series. I mean, some stories can barely fill out a trilogy. Also, the characters in the Morganville books are just awesome. I could read books from this series for days. In no way am I waiting for it to end. I can't wait to see what happens in book 12!"
4,"I finally finished this book today! Yayyy. I think it took me a little bit over a month to read, which is a really long time considering it was such a short book. However, I was on vacation during most of that month so reading obviously wasn't a priority and then once I came back from vacation school started, so reading Perks again wasn't a priority. But I really did want to finish what I started and finally did :) 
 I did enjoy the book overall, but it definitely wasn't what I had been expecting. The protagonist was a unique character and that was a major plus to the book as it kept me interested. The flow of the story and the narrating style was fast-paced and easy to follow. The plot overall was interesting to say the least, and the ending was a bit of a shock (or it was for me). 
 I have seen half of the movie, and might possibly finish the other half someday, but so far I don't really like the movie as much as the book. But it's always fun to compare and contrast the book and movie, so I might finish it on a boring Sunday afternoon. 
 Many have read this book/watched the movie, especially with the hype at the end of last year, and I do feel terribly behind with just having finished the book...but better late than never right? :)"
4,"I has all the things I like... A scarred hero who is also considerably younger than the heroine, an intelligent and educated woman,good love scenes and emotional healing. what's not to love??? How I wish this book were longer....*sigh*"
3,"Hrm. This one is tough because I'm not sure why it felt like a slog fest, but it did. It took forever for me to get through it, which is a stark contrast to the first two that I flew through and completely enjoyed. 
 I'm also not sure about the ending. There is certainly room left for more novels, but this was billed as a trilogy so it's confusing. Not all of the questions I had were answered, but I'm not sure I would read another book if it's written given how bored I was with this one."
4,"This was a great sequel it was action packed, I read it in one sitting. I felt like crying laughing, screaming all in one book. Celaena Sardothien is now the king's champion in 4 years she will be free of her contract. Dorian characters is growing as a future king, and life has some surprises for him in his sleeve. Chaol has made a stupid mistake that costs him dearly. And Celaena is just amazing and so much more then we originally knew. Sarah has some big revelations in this book and she did a great job (again) with this book. When is the third book coming out? I need it like right now."
2,"I FINALLY FINISHED IT! Why the Dickens did this have to be so long? (See what I did there?) 
 I see why this is a classic - parts of the prose are beautiful, and the story is actually lovely. But dang, I just do not enjoy reading 400+ pages of Charles ""Paid by the Word"" Dickens. 
 Story: 5/5 
 Actually Slogging Through the Text: 0/5"
5,"Words cannot express the beauty and significance of this book; reading it was for me a deep and heart breaking experience that I'm sure I will never forget. How can you forget a story like this, characters like Jude and Malcolm, prose so beautiful and poignant! This is a book about a (big) life and one of the best books I've ever read about genuine friendship, true love, suffering and redemption, sorrow and grief. 
 So many times I fought back tears; so many times I felt sick to my stomach and so many times my heart ached for Jude... 
 And yes it is a long book, but the reading of it is so rewarding, albeit gut-wrenching, that the 700 or so pages should not detain you from doing it. ''Little Life"" has a magical flow to it, as soon you start being invested in the characters time and pages will fly by in an instant. 
 So glad I choose this as my first 2016 read and I challenge all my GoodReads friends to read this amazing book as soon as possible."

3,"I want to say I enjoyed the story. But I really have mixed feelings. I actually checked the time left in the audio a couple times (like I would with a slow movie). I felt like it was disjointed and prolonged. when the main character or others started on ramblings about the meaning of life, I felt like I was being talked at by the author. It didn't feel like it was a natural fit. 
 I give it 3 because I finished & some of the twists I didn't catch."
5,"Now i'm not sure which is my favorite story, Joss and Braden, Ellie and Adam or Jo and Cam. Love the series."
5,I enjoyed this so much. Great suspense especially.
4,"Staying up until 2 am to finish this book was totally worth it. 
 I really enjoyed this book the second time around, mostly cuz I feel like I never really did read it the first time. Yes the world is a bit different and takes some getting used to, but other than that, it was fantastic. Also didn't like the insta love too much, but as per usual, that was explained later in the book. The plot twist 150 pages from the end? Didn't see that coming at all, but I really did enjoy it. However, I didn't like the back story that came with it, I felt like the author could have summed it up in a few short paragraphs. 
 Overall, I really recommend this book to anyone who likes Urban and regular fantasy! 4/5 stars! 
 Review to go up on Two Book Girls next week."
2,"I hate to say this but I didn't rate this anywhere near as good as the first 3 books. Maybe it was the irritating way some of the girls at the school talked. Maybe it was the strange conclusion. Simply put, I did not enjoy it and for the first time with a Tana French book I speed-read some of the chapters. 
 Just too samey and boring and irritating."
5,"Memoirs of a Geisha tells of things that the world often overlooks or doesn't care about - the things that go on behind closed doors. A world where underground sales of women occur to whoever can pay the highest price, and where self-esteem is long-gone. The way that this book is written is both emotional and effective, and the story is totally unforgettable."
4,"You didn't read that wrong. This is a young adult contemporary set novel about the Knights Templar with a female member of the merry band. It took me all of five seconds to go from 'omg what's this about?' to 'omg I need to have this'. You got to understand, my dad told me stories about the Templars since I was knee high to a grasshopper--they're one of his historical interests--so this just made me go squeee! 
 Though apparently being part of the Templars doesn't give a girl any special insight on how to deal with common problems. Like a friend coming back looking (and acting) different, or the hot new guy giving you hot looks. Or what to do if you're about to bring chaos, death and horror to a very large population of people. 
 Well, they have a way of dealing with that at least. Just...not a great one. 
 I won't say I loved the novel, but I did thoroughly enjoy it and absorb it quickly (despite how long its taken me to write up this review). There's details and descriptions that some might not understand unless you're a freak like me, but Chadda makes the Templars about as accessible as an ancient, supposedly dead fanatical off branch of the Church can possibly be. Billi is, for most of the book, a likable character. 
 Despite her unorthodox upbringing, she's normal for what she's gone through. Her moments of actual normality (worrying about Kay or Michael and what's going on) didn't seem out of place, this is as much as anything else a coming of age story after all. 
 I wasn't completely okay with how she treated Kay, or how Kay acted. Or for that matter Michael (though Michael has his reasons, which all things considered, make his attitude a little more understandable), but I got over it. The end though. I'm not sure what to say. I don't want to spoil anything, but bad decisions are bad decisions no matter what. Just remember that. 
 Even after reading the book, and being a little bit unhappy about some aspects, I can still honestly say that I'm still excited over it. Templars! There should be more young adult novels focused around Templars."
5,"Oh boy, oh boy! This was amazing, especially the ending. Already can't wait for the next one! 
 A def 5 stars"
4,"Alright, now I see what all the fuss is about. 
 LOVED the artwork here. The plot is interesting and the setting and world-building done here is INCREDIBLE. I like that they didn't give everything away in the first volume so it's basically begging you to read the second volume. I'll probably try and get my hands on volume 2 soon. 
 There's not much else to say. After reading volume 1, I can see why this makes it on mandatory graphic novel reading lists."
3,"Prose was too carefully and painstakingly arranged for my taste, but most of my friends really liked it."
1,"Didn't like it. At all. Maybe because I'm not a believer. I don't believe in God, so reading this book (where he plays a huge role) was not fun for me."
5,Clever and funny. Wonderful new series.
3,"Meh. It was ok. Way too feminist for me. But it's super cute and a good book for displaying. Pretty informative for a newbie to fandoms, which I am not, so this wasn't anything new to me. Worth picking up if you can get it for cheap."

 Bera The One-Headed Troll 
 By Eric Orchard 
 ISBN# 9781626721067 
 Brought to you by OBS Reviewer Scott 
 Bera The One Headed Troll is my fan pick of the year in graphic novels so far. When the evil wizard Cloote loses a baby she has stolen, and wants back badly, it's up to a humble pumpkin grower Bera, a one headed troll (they can have up to three I gather), to begin an epic journey away from her remote island to bring it back to its family. An epic adventure is in the works, takes Bera to meet heroes of ancient times, in her pursuit to outwit Cloote. A charming tale, that was good until the end, Bera The One Headed Troll belies Eric Orchard's somber writing, and skillful European styled art. 
 The writing was astounding for a work of 128 pages. The pacing was spot on and very little of the words were wasted. Told through expository text with dialogue at key points, Orchard weaves the Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey into the text with spectacular results. Monsters, talking rats, hedgehog wizards and, of course, trolls swirl together into a melting pot of speculative fiction. Each encounter serves an overall purpose, and those are the key points touched upon. A Tolkienesque take on trolls (such as turning to stone in the sunlight) and an almost Lord of the Rings like adventure, Bera's quest draws the reader into its web, and captivates one with its magic. Dialogue is handled well, with the unworldly Bera finding elderly heroes who are hundreds of years old. Even her pet owl has a voice that is as distinctive as any of the others. It truly synthesizes dialogue and exposition into an almost short work of fiction, let alone a graphic novel. 
 The art is stylized and mesmerizing, never missing a beat of the overall story. Dark and foreboding, forests loom, swamps take on a frightening new meaning, and towers have never looked so ominous. The sweeping vistas and the manner in which Orchard draws the characters and their environs is truly grandiose. The fine line work and attention to the bizarre creations and creatures that inhabit Bera's world are given character and life. Muted coloring makes the fantastic eerie, and the overall effect reflects the perilous journey of the protagonists. Panels are cleanly laid out, word balloons guide, and thus gives the art that much more of a presence. It's the art and story combined that give Bera The One Headed Troll is allure, and captivation of its audience. Either holds its own but together is what makes this graphic novel magical. 
 The plot is a weaving maze of uncertainty, as we are pulled with Bera from her Pumpkin patch into the areas she only knows about from maps hundreds of years old. Like Frodo stepping out of the Shire, the reader is compelled to follow these adventurers on their noble quest. Through the well placed hooks and baits, one becomes a part of the tale, as most of the poignant dialogue is taken up by other characters in the true epic format. For such a short work, Bera The One Headed Troll, packs a lot into it and deserves a good second reading to catch the subtle nuances of the story. 
 For fans of Tolkien, heroic adventure and European artwork to a well told story, Bera The One Headed Troll is sure to delight. Playing on the hero's journey, there is something for anyone from tweenies to adults to enjoy. It's a remarkable work that you'll read over and deserves a place on your shelf.

5,"This is a really cute story about a duke falling for a serving girl, and they were adorable and it was hot and swoony sometimes, but the true star of this book is the duke's mother - the current duchess. She is dry, sarcastic, bossy, controlling, and has a propensity to knit horrible little things in the hope of someday having a grandchild. 
 knitting kitteh is producing better projects than duchess no-grandma.. 
 Since her son, Griffin, is a total skeezebag in a previous book and doesn't look like he's getting anywhere in her quest for these grandchildren who will be wearing horrible monstrosities of yarn, the duchess takes matters into her own hands. By doing the most reasonable and logical thing to get her son to get married, of course. She drugs him and hauls his unconscious body into a carriage where he awakens in ""Spinster Cove"". She tells him that he will have to pick a bride from there and she will shape the girl into a duchess. He retaliates by picking a barmaid who is filthy and swears. 
 The barmaid IS his exit strategy 
 Griffin takes the barmaid, Pauline, aside and promises to pay her if she completely fails at all of the ""duchess lessons"" and shows his mother, and everyone else, how completely inappropriate she is for his wife. 
 Oh, but you know how these stories go. Of course she turns out to be a ""breath of fresh air"". Of course they find themselves hopelessly attracted to each other. Of course, everything backfires! 
 All to prove that mother DOES know best. Now, I need to go find a village of men to drive my daughter to after she eats the brownies I made her. 
 These guys look like fun. I wonder where they live.."
5,"ARC Received on behalf of Random House Publishing Group - Bantam Dell from NetGalley 
 Wanted, the first in the Most Wanted Series brings us Evan and Angie's story. This series will follow three friends and the woman who capture their hearts. 
 The blurbs and teasers of this series have remained partially vague so I will not go too far into the story. I barely saw more than the cover reveal before reading this and not knowing what to expect just heightened the experience. 
 Angie has wasn't always so controlled but events from her past have forced her to keep that wildness inside. Evan is the man that has caught her eyes since she was sixteen, the unattainable. The man that fueled her fantasies. But warnings were issued to stay away and promises were made. When an event occurs, those promises and warnings fall away. 
 Both hold secrets. But even if those secrets can't stay hidden from the one person who truly sees you. Evan might appear to be the put together business man and cherished son of Chicago; but appearances can be deceiving. Angie is just scratching the surface when it comes to figuring out the man can't seem to work out her system. But she knows that there is something far deeper connecting them than just the family ties that brought them together. 
 J. Kenner won me over with the sizzling Stark Trilogy, I knew that this author would be on my must read list. Wanted did not disappoint. The writing was superb, the sex was hot and the tension of these two could have set fire to my Kindle. Instead of a ton of relationship drama and angst we were given a few twists of suspense. Evan's character was complex and nothing about him was predictable. Angie had me rolling my eyes once or twice at the start of the story but that had more to do with her coping with the situation at hand. Once that event faded, her true colors came through. She was a strong heroine that although was suffering from events from her past; she was not completely weakened by it. 
 This series has such great potential, Tyler and Cole were introduced and will eventually become the Hero of their own stories. Although I would love nothing more than reading more about the dominating Evan, I love the idea of this series consisting of individual stories for each of the guys. I am intrigued to see how this series will play out, overlapping or continuing on from where the last left off... 
 I was so excited about getting a chance to read this early and suddenly I am a little depressed to know that I have to wait until May for Heated. A excellent read that fans of the Stark Trilogy and romance readers will love."
0,I received a copy of this book from Simon & Schuster Children's Publishing via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.
4,"I'm glad I got the chance to read this book. I believe this was my first time reading a book in the faerie genre, at least as far as I can recall. I was a little unfamiliar with the back story of some of the characters, especially since it's been a while since I've read ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"", but regardless, I really enjoyed it. To me, this book had a Labyrinth/NeverEnding Story/Alice in Wonderland vibe to it. I liked the characters, I liked the story, and I liked the world Julie Kagawa created. It was imaginative and exciting, with a great blend of action, adventure, and romance. I am very impressed that this is her debut novel. It's the kind of book I enjoy because you quickly become engrossed in it, and as you follow the characters on their journey it feels as if you are watching a movie. I knew I was hooked as I grew anxious reaching the final pages because I didn't want the story to end. Needless to say, I will definitely be reading the next book in this series! 
 I'd definitely recommend this book to YA readers who are fans of the supernatural/fantasy genre. 
 I must say, even though I read an electronic version of this book, I am sure I will end up buying the book because I think the cover is quite beautiful!"
2,"I thought I was reading the first book in this series, and I was sort of annoyed by the feeling that I SHOULD have known what was going on, but didn't. Turns out I was reading the third one (oops), and since I came in in the middle and there is some larger ~mystery~, I don't actually have any idea what is going on. I'm not sure I really care, though. I found the adults in this series far more interesting than the younger protagonists, who were paper-thin and kind of irritating, and I'm guessing the other four books in this YA series don't focus on the grown-ups."
4,"The Iron Queen is the third installment in the Iron Fey series. It follows Meghan, half human, half fey, and her boyfriend, Ash, the winter prince, and her best friend Puck, the summer fey prankster, as they face a final battle with the false Iron King who is destroying the world of Faery, swallowing up and over running it with Iron. Meghan is Farey's only hope and to win she will have to make the ultimate sacrifice. 
 Keeping up with the first two books, this book is action packed and adventured filled. And now that Ash and Meghan are free to be together it's full of beautiful romantic moments that will have readers swooning, and cheering. 
 I really enjoyed this book, and those who love faery books will undoubtably love them too. I can't help but absolutely love Ash, he is just the perfect leading man. He is strong, loyal, and loves so beautifully. I loved Puck more and more in this book, and i did feel a bit sorry for him(He's in love with Meghan.) Julie writes such strong characters with strong and varying personalities that jump off the page. 
 Even though this is the final battle there ia another in this series from Ash's point of view and i can't wait to read it. 
 This book will make you laugh, make you want to cry and keep you in the edge of your seat. Towards the end i couldn't put this book down. I highly recommand it."
4,"After finishing the three Farseer trilogies, I knew I had to read the ones about the Wild Rain and Liveship as well. 
 I knew already some details and Destiny of some of its most relevant characters, but it is always good to know how did they get there. 
 I gotta say this book has a lot of strong female characters, which I really like, but also some strong male characterization which only shows how good a writer Hobb is to write what she does being impartial to it. 
 All in all, I started slow but pressed nitro halfway through."
3,"3.5 rounded down because I really enjoyed the story, but had so many frustrations that I can't ignore. Some people may disagree with me and that's fine, there's a lot of hype. I wanted to like this so much more than I did. 
 In a ""Post-Mortality"" world where humanity has beat all forms of disease and death, the only way to die is to be gleaned by a scythe. Citra and Rowan have been selected to apprentice with the venerable Scythe Faraday, but only one of them will become a scythe after a year. The job is necessary for population control, and the best scythe is the one who doesn't want to do it. 
 Frustration number one: the scythes around Citra and Rowan are described in detail- their hair colour, robe colour, dominant ethnicity and motives. Citra and Rowan are never given this attention to detail and it drove me bonkers. Not even a hair colour to help me picture them. I would say it's a stylistic choice, but seeing as others were described it just seems like they were neglected. 
 There was also no character development. It became hard to predict what either protagonist would do in any situation. I kept getting the sense that things were out of character before realizing that the issue was that neither of them HAD an established character. Their decisions and emotions seemed so random. While the reasoning for Scythe Faraday selecting Citra and Rowan to be his apprentices was somewhat justified by their not wanting to do the job, they could have been anybody. 
 Their chemistry together was also just assumed and came out of nowhere. What is it about their personalities that made them click? Citra has no personality! At least the romance wasn't a heavy feature, but I just didn't buy it. (view spoiler)[ Also, it was after several months apart, more time than they had actually spent together, that they decided they loved each other? (hide spoiler)] 
 My second frustration was less of one, and it was simply that I wanted to know more about this post-mortal age. Furniture from the ""Age of Mortality"" (our time) is described in detail because to the characters it is out of place in their world. For the reader though, the author needs to then in turn describe what Citra and Rowan's world looks like, and he didn't. So overall my main issue with this is the lack of imagery the writing called up. The writing isn't necessarily bad but it wasn't standout good in a sea of YA. This isn't the author's debut novel so I expected more. 
 Okay now the icky bit is over and here are the positives! The concept is right up my alley, and I enjoyed the plot. It's a cool idea that no one can die of natural causes anymore, and that there would be some kind of organization responsible for killing people. What I loved most is that they're humans. The scythes are not some sci-fi magic beings that have special abilities, they're humans who were called to the task reluctantly, to end people's lives with dignity (and some with a flair for creativity). Of course this is a breeding ground for the power hungry, but that's what makes it interesting. I also liked the idea of a utopian YA novel, which I've never read before, where the focus is on the few people responsible for bringing darkness to that utopia. There are also some twists and although they're pretty predictable, they're still satisfying. 
 I won't give away the conflict and whatnot, though perhaps it's in the synopsis (I never read those if I can avoid it, LIVE FOR THE SURPRISE!), because I thought it was neat. This book has a political element in it that I really appreciated. In other YA series I've shied away from these aspects because they usually aren't that interesting, and seem like a copout for developing good villains. I liked the power struggle in this one, though the villain may have been a bit black-and-white BAD, and we were never allowed to forget that as his arrogance was spattered on every page. Still, I thought Shusterman did a good job there. 
 Despite my two little frustrations, I would still recommend this book to fans of YA and Ya sci-fi. While I'd recommend it with less enthusiasm to people like myself who have a love-hate thing with YA, I'd still say try it. I'm excited to for the rest of the series."
3,"While I can appreciate what the author is trying to do-put a fresh, feminist twist on a hackneyed cliche-the twist failed to feel, well, fresh. Instead, it's just the diatribes of a character who claims to be self aware but is really anything but. As a result, the story seems to drag along, and I had a difficult time staying interested-hence the almost two month lapse between my start and my finish. 
 After a while, I started to wish that the author had gone with a cliche storyline and ended it with a twist. Though I might have lost interest faster, it would have done a better job of subverting the genre-because this book, despite all its commentary on cliches, fails to escape cliches itself. 
 Not awful, but I wouldn't recommend it, either."
4,"There's a tension all the way through this book, as the author shows you a bit of a magical place then drags you back to what we call reality. The normal-world characters are just short of irritatingly normal, and we who know more are frustrated by their inability to think, ""Maybe ..."" 
 Maybe it's rooted in the experience we have all had as children, where ""Mommy, I just saw a (whatever)!"" got you a ""SURE you did, dear, now run along."" That's pretty much the book. 
 There are some good characters here. Tara is not presented in detail, but that's necessary for the story. Richie starts out as a stock character but develops a bit. Jack's little side story turns out to be important. 
 Dr. Underwood is a continual surprise, stuck in his framework but never quite predictable; he never slips all the way into the generic psychiatrist mould, and at the end we are not quite sure how he resolves things. 
 I didn't like the presentation of the otherworld males as generic dark-haired charismatic earring-wearers (what we called classic gypsies on the 50s and 60s), but only because they're almost always done that way. 
 I like stories that remind us that the don't-call-us-fairies are often not very nice and use a different moral structure than we do. I think a lot of people who disliked this book had trouble with that. 
 Mrs. Larwood developed nicely, and slowly, as a little bit more than a generic old lady. 
 If the book has a fault, it's that the ending becomes inevitable too early."
5,"Good book and great sequel to the Hunger Games! I was definitely caught off guard in a handful of areas and I liked that. I didn't see a lot of it coming. I also grew much more attached to Peeta as a stand alone character, and Gale seemed to be more 'meh' to me. Overall, it was an amazing book of revolution. The Gamemakers had thought of even more fucked up ways to amp up the stakes, and I came to love a few more characters."
3,"Classic subtle ""horror"". I suppose this was probably really creepy for its time, but now I only felt so much pity for those poor creatures, and disgust at all the ""men"". The story itself was solid."
5,"This book is 432 pages long? I read an e-book so I didn't know the page count, but I do know that it sure didn't feel that long. It actually ended really quickly. 
 But I guess that's what happens when a book is so much fun that you're surprised the book also had a plot. Because plots are supposed to be the boring, or interesting, parts of a novel with some fun squeezed between them. The whole thing can't be fun! That's just not possible. But uncle Rick proves one again that he is awesomeness personified. Because this book... is wonderful. 
 For one, we have Apollo's narrative, which is filled with his all his numerous whinings that usually start with ""when I was a god"" or ""if I was a god"" or ""when I become a god again"". Seriously, that dude is so not adjusting and it's hilarious to read. Apollo is narcissistic, self-absorbed and would use you as a shield against monsters, but he's still so likable. And he's also learning, much to his disgust, to be selfless. I love the guy and I love his narrative. 
 Then there's the fact that this series is almost like an epilogue for the Percy Jackson and the Heroes of Olympus series, giving us moments of closure with all the old characters one by one, while also introducing new characters, and mythical figures and creatures. 
 There is honestly so much going on and I don't know how Rick Riordan is balancing all of it. The writing is very clever too, so there's something in there for people of all ages. I feel like Rick Riordan is highly underappreciated because everyone just considers him the ""fun"" writer, as if it's not masterful the way he balances multiple characters, storylines, humour, emotion, characters development, adventure, action and backstory so brilliantly. People seem to equate good writing to serious writing with as little entertainment as possible. And that makes me very sad. 
 Thankfully, whenever I'm sad, I can just reread a book by uncle Rick and comfort myself with the knowledge that I appreciate him very much. 
 Anyway, I got off topic there. Lets get back to the book. I love it. Maybe even a little more than 
 The Hidden Oracle 
 because we got even more into the character of Apollo and there was an emotional arc with Meg (thanks to Nero, the turd) that made me finally like the character, where I was a bit iffy about her before. 
 Overall, this book was everything I wanted from the sequel and I can't wait for the next part to come out. I'm going to leave you with the first haiku from the novel, because I love it: 
 Lester (Apollo) 
 Still human; thanks for asking 
 Gods, I hate my life 
 P. S. Just now noticed that I didn't mention the plot. Though you probably know, still, it's follows Apollo, Leo and Calypso as they head off on Festus to search for Meg, the second Roman emperor, and another old oracle that the Triumvirate has control of."
4,"Really liked the first chapter in this one, non-anime material. I like how Tamaki doesn't even try and ends up second best in the class."
5,"I adored the whimsical atmosphere and writing style throughout this book. However, I can say with certainty that I will never ever be able to see the Queen of Hearts in the same way again. It's amazing how things could go so wrong, so quickly. It goes to show what a cruel, beautiful world we live in, and that not all stories have a happy ending."
3,"This was a cute read. A little unrealistic, but still a cute and easy read. The entire premise for the novel is a bit ridiculous, but I really liked the conversations that Chloe has with her coworkers. They definitely talk about some really ""hot topics"" in a way that feels authentic rather than preachy. Also, I really liked seeing a character with diabetes and her diabetes actually being a part of the story. A fun 3 star read."
3,"I can't consider this a real happy ending. The clothes Miranda wore were interesting, especially when described. Not bad, not good, not a favorite."
4,"I really liked this book, maybe even more than the first in the series. 
 I hate calling it a series because even though there is some continuity in the characters in all reality the books are complete stand alones and in my opinion almost read like they were written by two different authors. 
 Good story, the main character was not a total douche who I wanted to kick in the balls, the author wrapped things up nicely, in general I have no complaints about the book. Not 100% whether that means I'll get the next in the series though."
5,"So, I originally picked this up because I can't listen to audiobooks on the train and I have a bunch of commuting to do on the train in the next couple of days, starting today, and I figured I'd read this fluffy, fun read through those boring hours on the train ride. And then I ended up reading this in one fucking day, it was that amazing! 
 I'm going to talk more about this book a little bit later, cause I'm super fucking tired and I need sleep cause I got up way too early in the morning, but just know that this book is definitely worth the hype and you should go and read it."

 Blog tour will take place on Monday January 12th, 2015 at Beyondboyfriendreviews.tumblr.com 
 Title: 'Til Death 
 Series: 'Til Death #2 
 Author: Bella Jewel 
 Genre: Erotica New Adult 
 Release Date: Jan 12th, 2015 
 Rating: 5 stars 
 This wonderful sequel is just perfection. Bella Jewel hit it out of the park with this novel. I finished this book in just a few hours and I never wanted it to end. I had a struggle because i never wanted it to end but I just need to finish, I wanted to know what came next. I craved what came next. 
 I felt the strong emotions between the two characters, it was like I was feeling the same thing they were feeling. Bella Jewel does a perfect job making the past and present day connect. The writing flowed, it was just a beautiful tear jerker book that left me completely insane."
5,"*5/5 stars* 
 Wow, I'm really sad this series is now over. But this last book was the best one out of all of them. There was ever more action/violence, but also more moments between all the Foxes. I loved how the dynamic changed between the monsters and the upperclassmen. 
 This book had me crying, laughing, and on the edge of my seat. I really experienced all the emotions. Neil is an amazing character, he might be very stupid but I loved reading about him and his smart mouth, it was really entertaining. Reading about Andrew in this book was like reading about a whole different character. Free from his medication, he's a very quiet person to read about, but I loved that. And I loved his developing relationship with Neil. Even though I felt like I needed more. One part of me is okay with Andrew's lack of words, just showing his love in his actions. Another part of me wanted more,, 
 After finishing this book, I felt like I not only wanted more, but also NEEDED more. I feel like this is one of those books where I have to rely on fanfics to get closure. 
 ** I just learned that Nora Sakavic has some extra content on her website, so I'll definitely read that straight away and see if it helps. 
 But it's definitely a series I'd love to re-read in the future, and I would want it to be turned into a tv show."
3,"Moth and Spark has an intriguing premise. Many years before, the world's dragons were enslaved. Prince Corin, heir to the throne of the country where the dragons lived before their enslavement, is forced by a dragonrider to drink something that changes him and requires him to break the enslavement. He becomes in tune with the dragons and their mysterious, nonhuman ways of communicating. At the time of the enslavement, wizards were virtually wiped out. Corin's father made a secret arrangement with the last of the wizards, providing for them in exchange for their service. 
 Tam is a commoner; she and Corin meet cute in the castle library. She has been allowed to visit summer court because her sister-in-law is a baron's daughter. Tam and Corin quickly (too quickly) fall in love, but they can Never Ever marry because he is heir to the throne and she is a commoner. It is Just Not Done. The unhappiness of the dragons is causing a tense situation with neighboring countries to get worse, and war is on the horizon. Corin knows he must succeed in freeing the dragons in order to save his country. 
 The first part of the book was pretty good. Then it kind of fell apart for me. Tam comes into some power quickly and without significant effort. Things happen without explanation and (view spoiler)[ when war is about to begin, five days after Tam and Corin met, Corin proposes in the heat of the moment and the King himself performs the wedding ceremony! I was like - what?!? If it was that easy, why all the fuss about their relationship? And seriously - five days?) (hide spoiler)]. Tam's beauty and ability to attract everyone grew old, as did their flirting and lovemaking amid what should have been times of true worry. 
 One good thing is that Moth and Spark is a standalone book, with a complete story. It also has a lovely cover. So much promise, not quite realized, but I would give the author another try if she publishes another fantasy novel."
5,"Another in the Persephone Alcmedi series, this book picks up where the last let off and a couple of problems are added that need to be dealt with swiftly. 
 I was very satisfied with this installment and am looking forward to the next!"
5,"This review was written for The Review Diaries: http://reviewdiaries.blogspot.com/201... 
 The other day I finished 'The Vespertine' by Saundra Mitchell. I put the book down. I stroked the cover. I sighed, and thought about the beautiful prose. And then I picked it up and started it all over again. After two reading's I still don't really want to stop reading it, but I feel slightly more capable of making coherent sentences over it instead of just 'flehnin, beautiful, love, book!' 
 It's been a quiet few days. 
 As I explained on twitter 33 pages into my first reading, I was irrevocably in love, and completely ruined for all others - THAT'S HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS BOOK. Ahem. 
 So the most important thing here, is that you should go and read this book now. No seriously, I'll even lend you my car to drive to the book store RIGHT NOW. 
 But some of you less persuadable people probably need a little more convincing... 
 Six reasons why you should go and read 'The Vespertine' 
 1) The cover. Not just one, but two! The pretty picture on the front and the old style hardback underneath. I swooned a little when I peeked under the jacket. 
 2) If you liked Libba Bray's 'A Great & Terrible Beauty' you will love this. That's how I came to realize that I would need this book in my life pronto, because I adored Bray's writing and wanted to find something similar. 
 3) The Writing. I could go on and on over how exquisitely beautiful the writing is and it still wouldn't convey just how amazing it is. I love funny writing, I love solid and well structured writing, but most of all I love poignantly beautiful and evocative writing. This falls firmly into the latter. Carrie Ryan describes the writing as 'truer than truth - you feel them (the descriptions) rather than know them.' You feel every word, every moment, every breath. It's as though Mitchell has taken all of the moments you've watched and felt and put them into words you never even realized could express how you felt until you read them. 
 4) The Characters. I adore Amelia, and it's one of the most important things in the world to have a loveable heroine. I also love the relationship between her and Zora, which is summed up so perfectly in the opening chapters : 
 ""In that moment, I suppose we could have decided to be rivals. Instead, Zora took my hand and said, 'We're too grand to stay indoors today, I believe.'"" 
 Their friendship is so natural, so teasing and wonderful to read. It's completely believable - as are the relationships that develop between the other girls in the circle and the delectable boys they come into contact with. And oh the boys... No triangles, no mess, just lust and sparks and gorgeousness, and the right people falling in love with the other right people. And Nathaniel. Oh baby. I loved him from the start, but there is one scene in particular that made me swoon. And be absolutely terrified for a moment, but mostly swoon. For those who have read the book - boys who ask you to jump, definite yes. 
 5) The Premise. I love fantasy, but I love subtle fantasy, and this falls firmly into that category. It's such an exquisite idea, seeing visions in the sunset. An extraordinary gift that just adds that extra spark of magic to an already brilliant novel. Seriously this novel was amazing already, but this adds that extra dimension that makes into a wow novel. 
 6) The Setting. I am a sucker for period settings in books (note to self to provide picture of the ridiculous numbers of regency books on my shelves.) and I am even more of a sucker when it's all about the first season of the characters. There is something magical about a debutante's season, and Mitchell conveys this perfectly. The cycle of visits, teas, picnics, dress fittings and most importantly balls - I love it. I want it. I want to climb inside this book and live it. 
 So if I haven't made it clear already, I loved this book. In fact it may well be my favourite book of the whole year, and we're only in March. I will come back to this book again and again - it's one of those ones that as soon as I've finished I just want to plunge straight back in again and immerse myself in the world for as long as possible. 
 Books like this are true gems, and (saying this a lot, but the standard is so high this year!) I cannot wait for Saundra Mitchell's next books. 
 Go out, read it, love it, and pass on the news, that 'The Vespertine' is the book to be reading right now."
3,"The second book in this series, in my opinion, fell a little bit short of the caliber of the first book. It was still a good and entertaining read, but I wasn't exactly dying to know what happened in the end. I'm hoping that Library of Souls redeems it for me."
4,"Duff hits more of a 3.5 stars kind of range with me but since that's not an option I went ahead and bumped it up to a four-star rating seeing as it really 
 was 
 a fun story that 
 wasn't 
 overly watered down, or coming off as more of a pre-teen guide to what they think high school is like. 
 ""Spanish, huh? Can you say anything interesting?"" 
 ""El tono de tu voz hace que queria estrangularme."" 
 ""That sounds sexy, what's it mean?"" 
 ""The sound of your voice makes me want to strangle myself."" 
 ""Kinky."" 
 Wesley's specialty, turning insults into foreplay. 
 Why I Loved It! 
 It was fun and fast paced. I can't tell you how bored I am with books that drag on several chapters before any real substances or action happens. The concept of what a DUFF is literally made me Laugh-Out-Loud when I read the description. 
 The 'DUFF' is the Designated Ugly Fat Friend. The DUFF of the group doesn't necessarily have to be ugly, it's just simply the term Wesley has dubbed as the least attractive girl in the group, and at the risk of coming off sounding like a Jerk, the logistics of how he explains the DUFF is kinda sad but true. But then again, don't we all feel like the DUFF sometimes. 
 ""The point is, scientists have proven that every group of friends has a weak link, a Duff. And girls respond well to guys who associate with their Duffs."" 
 ""Crackheads can call themselves scientists now? That's news to me."" 
 Did I mention I loved the snarky humor? 
 Classic Tales with a Modern Twist 
 While this next part is often done with several YA novels, I really did enjoy the connection to other major pieces of well-respected literature, such as Wuthering Heights. 
 There are many things that can go wrong putting a contemporary twist on an age old tale of something as highly acclaimed as the classics. However, it's always interesting to see stories from a completely different era of thought still hold validity in a modern story line, hearing the same old story in a new light. Some things may change, but there are aspects within human nature that allow us to understand certain concepts, no matter how different the times may be. It's that fundamental level of human nature that connects us all; what allows us to empathizes with characters from stories, like those written by Shakespeare hundreds of years later. 
 What I Didn't Like 
 My major complaint was some of the cliche language. Being in high school does not make you incompetent of completing sentences without the improper use of the word 'like'. Also, the use of the 'F-word' seemed forced. I have no qualms with authors inserting curse words as it fits with the characterization. In fact, I find it more unrealistic when authors have young adults replacing curse words with stuff that sounds like it hasn't been used since the 50's, simply for the fact they don't like to curse. Let's be real, it's just a word. 
 However, I think in the case of DUFF, we see excessive use of curse words to the point it is distracting for the sake, or so it seems, of using them. Bianca drops the f-word at the most random of instances, just for the sake of using them. This really doesn't fit her character. Dropping a curse word in every conversation does not make the characters more believable. Perhaps if this weren't some small town school, and took place in a crime ridden neighborhood, I might be willing to believe the common use of such strong language in such large and sloppy quantity as being acceptable. Bianca is an AP, college bound, cynic. NOT a kid with a extreme case of Turrets that excuses the amount of randomly placed curse words. 
 If you've ever seen dick figures on youtube, then Lord Turrette is a perfect description to what I'm talking about 
 Maybe the kids of Hamilton high should lay off the Tupac cd's for a while. 
 Having said that, the story isn't terribly flawed and the relationship development is believable. I was sucked into the love/hate relationship between Wesley and Bianca from the first time she dumped her Cherry Cola on his head. It's a great tale of realizing that we all are insecure sometimes, and that while distractions are nice reality always has a way of rearing its ugly head. 
 I would recommend this book if you're a fan of angsty romances, where the main characters are often at each other's throats as often as they're in each other's beds."
5,I don't know how I missed this novel in the Vorkosigan saga. Absolutely loved being immersed back in another Miles story. It was fun seeing him and Roic back in action. Fantastic plot & book. The drabble at the end of the book brought tears to my eyes.
3,"I quite like the Penderwick girls. This is an adorable story and it was nice to Rosalind take a step back. I love Batty and sometimes she makes the most sense. It's nice to see Jeffrey back as well (and Aunt Claire). I enjoyed the twist but I was really disappointed in Jeffrey's reaction, blaming Alec for not knowing when how could he have known. I'd be blaming Jeffrey's mother but then I'm not a 12 year old boy finding out such things."
5,EPIC story! The writer managed to keep me engaged through the three generations. Also was a great insight into a disorder I had no clue about. I would recommend this to anyone who loves to read.
5,That was absolutely incredible. Read this. JUST DO IT!

5,"Lifers by Jane Harvey-Berrick 
 5 stars!! 
 ""You've turned...into a life sentence for all of you - for Paul, for Jordan. You turned them into lifers."" 
 This book was certainly an emotional rollercoaster and the writing was absolutely flawless! This is one of those books that makes you ""feel"" and as I have said in numerous reviews, that is a really special talent. Yes this story is sad in parts, it is emotional, it has you thinking and is extremely thought provoking, but the genius here is that Jane Harvey-Berrick has written her heroine (Torrey) with such an amazing sense of humour that even when I was crying, in the next heart beat I was laughing. This book is perfectly balanced, I totally and utterly loved it and I could not put it down. 
 Torrey was a girl that you couldn't help but fall in love with; she has had more than her fair share of knock backs and this has left her very mis-trusting. After her latest failed relationship, she plays the field, desperate to never feel that sense of loss again. She literally puts up a wall on her emotions and her dalliances with the opposite sex are purely that, after all it is just sex, just a release. Having relocated back to her mum's whom she hasn't had a relationship with for over 10 years; she gets a mundane job in a cafe while taking a break from her career as a paralegal. One day in walks Jordan Kane, the world stops, he seems to be the local pariah but Torrey is fascinated and that is the day the world changed for them both. 
 Jordan Kane, I totally and utterly fell for this guy, hook, line and sinker. He had me the minute he walked into that cafe. You cannot help but be drawn into his story; he is out on parole, having had to move back to his parents as one of the conditions. This is a small town, everybody knows everybody and of course they all know yours and everyone else's business. He is un-liked, unloved and unwanted by everyone, including his parents. He is desperate for some acceptance, some love, anything. He feels extremely guilty for what has happened and cannot live with it, he feels that he needs to be constantly punished so takes all these knock backs as his retribution; this is the life that he feels that he deserves. The trouble is, he doesn't and until he can accept that, he will never be able to live or love, at the end of the day it was an accident and he needs to learn to forgive himself first and foremost. 
 ""And Cain said to the Lord, ""My punishment is greater than I can bear."""" 
 Jordan's story is heart breaking, intensified by the extremely emotive writing of Jane Harvey-Berrick. She certainly pulls you in, captivates you and doesn't let you go till the very last page. I seriously cannot gush about this book enough. This is a love story and it is this slow but sure tale that has you totally and utterly entranced. You want them both to succeed, you want them both to love and most importantly you want them both to heal. They are truly perfect for each other. Torrey's no-nonsense and shoot from the hip attitude are just what Jordan needs to keep him grounded, she reigns him in when he falters, she gives him solace when he needs it, but no matter what she is always there for him no matter how hard sometimes he tries to push her away. It is Jordan's huge heart that will have you melting, with Torrey working her magic, slowly bringing the real ""Jordan Kane"" back to life, you start to see the real man emerge and once he does you just love him all the more. It is this huge heart, his passion, his loyalty and his sincerity that finally break down any remaining walls Torrey had erected. 
 ""every time I think it couldn't be better than the last time, but every time it is. Every time I think I've had the best there is, you teach my body something new. I can't get enough of you, Jordan Kane."" 
 This is a must read, it is one of books that touches you, that will stay with you and one that I feel I will certainly be reading again. I totally and utterly loved it. Go forth and 1click, you won't be disappointed!"
4,"I didn't love this one as much as I thought I would, but had I been younger, I think I would have fallen in love with it. It is dark, heart-warming and wonderful.

3,Hey warning guys! I liked this book but it had some inappropriate stuff in it. So just keep an eye out.
5,So good! Such a nice contained book. I become more and more of a Sanderson fan with each book I read.
0,"After just reading the Prologue, all I can say is: 
 I NEED BOOK #3 LIKE YESTERDAY!!!"
5,"""Oblivion is increasingly attractive to the young, and even to the middle aged, since why retain your brain when no amount of thinking can even begin to solve the problem?"" 
 Margaret Atwood is truly one of the best writers of our time. Whatever story she sets out to tell is well crafted, beautifully written, and will leave you thinking differently about the world. The Heart Goes Last follows a future where big companies crashed leaving almost everyone jobless. Stan is desperately seeking employment and Charmaine works at a dive bar during the day. One day at work, Charmaine sees a television commercial about a town called Consilience where they offer housing, employment, and safety. Stan and Charmaine sign up for Consilience despite having to trade in their freedom every second month for a prison cell. 
 Stan and Charmaine are not likeable characters. They often make questionable decisions, are selfish, and are not pleasant to read. These qualities only enhance the story in a similar way that the characters from Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn make that story. 
 They are put through extreme and crazy situations and the way they react is a pleasure to read. 
 As always Atwood's future world is disturbing and plausible, so if you're looking for a fantastic speculative fiction story look no further. You will not be disappointed!"
4,"This was a recommendation from my stepdaughter. 
 A quick read for an adult, and a fairly straightforward follow-up to the Song of the Lioness books. Years later, the next girl tries to follow in Alanna's footsteps and faces some lingering prejudices while trying to go through the training completely out in her identity as a girl. This is a nice comparison to the previous series when Alanna hid her identity. 
 The construction of the heroine is straightfoward as well. She is strong in her beliefs and stubborn and has several strengths in combat and learning, but a very obvious weakness that she has to overcome. She makes friends, and I really enjoyed the construction of the characters around her who become her comrades. I think my favorite part of the book was her relationship with the sparrows - a very nice illustration how a good deed will result in great help down the line. 
 Highly recommend for young adult readers or anyone who enjoys a good novel in this category. It's fun, easy to read, and has a good cast of interesting characters."
4,"The best one so far, of the 3 I've read.. it was less contrived because of less focus on all the text messages from ""A"" all the time.. stuff happens! More review to follow..."
4,"The writing style is not great, and at times feels a little bit amateur-ish, but the story unfolds really nicely, and it's the first book in a long time that I've actually been excited and wanted to keep going back to as soon as possible. 
 Some of the characters are less developed than in the show, but I think that's only to be expected. As a novel in its own right, it stands up well.

 While Anna is accused of murdering her best friend you feel just as frustrated as she does, as she's trying so hard to prove her innocence. She's awaiting trial in jail and she's just lost her best friend in the most brutal way, while she's abandoned by almost everybody, including her friends and her boyfriend. You can't help but feel sorry for her. 
 The book switches between the present day (the trial and everything leading up to it) and what happened before BFF Elise gets butchered in Aruba. A lot of times I was thinking oh Anna, you poor girl and I loved how this book managed to get me so emotionally invested. 
 Glad I read this!"
5,"If there was words that existed to describe the length of my love for this book I would use them, but since there isn't, I will just say one thing: Holy. Damn. Amazingballs. 
 This is no surprise to those that have read it. Rick Yancey's The Fifth Wave has got to be one of the, hands-down best books I have read in years. 
 This was one of those highly anticipated books which everyone kept talking about wanting to read or have read. It definitely lived up to the hype and expectation. 
 The well-thoughtout characters to the devastating yet fascinating world building Yancey has created, there is simply nothing not to love about this book. 
 It may be the first in a new series but it might as well have been half way through, because the story was so thorough and planned out, I could not praise it enough. 
 Our main characters consist of female protagonist, Cassie; Evan and Ben. The book is also split up into sections and alternates POVs. 
 We're introduced how the world came to be how it is portrayed today. What happened to make it that way and how it hasn't stopped, just in a different stage. Cassie finds herself alone and fighting through life after the kidnapping of her brother. She soon meets mysterious and alluring Evan, who is someone she isn't sure she can trust. In a word such as this... I can't say I blame her. She'll do anything she can to find and locate her brother, Sammy, but she might have to trust Evan somewhat if he is her key in getting back the only family she has left. 
 This is a beautifully written story. It's tragic. Devastating and emotional as our characters slowly find the answers they are looking more... but will they find out more than they bargained for? 
 We're introduced to what exactly what the 5th Wave is, which happens to be the next stage of the elimination process of mankind, and it just may be the worst one yet. 
 There is a slow romance burning. It's not a main factor, but it is more like an ember slowly burning throughout the book, which will burn into the second book --- going by the ending, that is. 
 I absolutely loved Cassie. She is a lone ranger. A fighter. After all she has been through, I can understand why. Her brother is the only one she has and she takes it upon herself to do everything she can to look after him. Because if she doesn't, who will? 
 Evan I also loved from the beginning too. He was mysterious with secrets lurking in the shadows. There was something about him that appeared odd and suspicious... and just when you discover what he is hiding.... may shock you to the very core. 
 I absolutely anticipate the next book. Can August 2014 hurry up please? How do these publishers expect us to wait over a year? I just do not approve. Not at all.

 What can I say... I still love this series, I still love this book, and I still WANT SHADE!!!! 
 Could he be any more perfect?!?! He's all dark and sexy, but he's such a sweetheart! I think Runa is his perfect match, I love reading about them together, she's stands up to him, and complements his personality perfectly. And they're just HOT together! 
 Yes, my favorite scenes have to be in the cave, and then when he turns demon and does that thing with his tail! Very talented! ;) Ha! 
 The storyline is amazing too, there's a lot of action, deceipt, of course family is always the first one to turn their back on you, huh? 
 OMG, my favorite is the side story with Gem and Kynan! I forgot how much I love to read about these two!!!!! I really wish they would've gotten their own book, and I always find myself so excited to read their parts! In this book Kynan is still torn up about the death and lies of his ex-wife, and towards the end when he is starting to come around *fans self*. 
 Shade... still one of my top demons!!! And this series, still rocks, even the second time around!"
5,"I chose to do this play for my ISU in my high school Writer's Craft class. We had to analyze the style of the author, and I figured that there was so much information on Shakespeare's style that I may as well go for it. I picked A Midsummer Night's Dream because I had heard it referenced a few times and was curious. It turned out to be a good choice. 
 This is one of Shakespeare's comedies. It is a tangled web of love affair, with spells and potions gone awry, people falling madly in love with the wrong person, a man growing a donkey's head and crazy faeries that like to stir things up. I would love to see it performed."
3,"This was an entertaining read and I thought the author did a pretty good job of world-building. Nothing too special or unique added to the ""vampire"" story, although I did appreciate that they weren't the ""hip G-rated"" vampire that seems to be going around - none of this, ""we can survive on animal blood!"" crap."
4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 You know what. This was better than I expected. I like how the story ended for our MC's, and feel like I have closure for the series. 
 The only thing I'm wondering about is are all those Arum just going to leave them alone now? I mean, there was a hell of a lot of them. Do they have some sort of unspoken truce, or are they 'safe' because they are hiding out near the quartzite? 
 Anyway, that's my only little issue. Loved the rest :)"
3,"3.5. Well. I liked it more than the Lunar Chronicles as a whole but less than Cinder on its own. Meyer is way descriptive in this book and it wasn't hard to picture the land of Hearts or the Crossroads. I played a mental movie with the aid of her words. The idea of a backstory for the Queen of Hearts piqued my interest because, let's face it, the Queen of Hearts usually appears to be some head-chopping-red-heart-wearing-walrus-sized woman with horrible hair. Or, well, at least she is depicted like that in the 1951 Alice in Wonderland animated film. 
 In this book, the future Queen of Hearts is named Catherine and she loves to bake. She's quite the dreamer and finds herself incapable of saying no to people (but who hasn't experienced this at some point in life?). Enter Jest, the eyeliner wearing joker who immediately grabs her attention. Then you've also got the short, insipid, woefully dull King of Hearts who is actually a five year-old in the body of a man and who can't rule his kingdom worth a single crap. There are other original Wonderland characters as well, the Caterpillar who likes to blow smoke in people's faces, the Cheshire Cat who I have always found creepy (that cartoon version of him chilled my young soul), the Mad Hatter, the White Rabbit, and that cute little mouse who sleeps in tea pots. 
 I didn't really buy into the burning, passionate romance between Jest and Catherine. It just suddenly happened and then kept going and they truly didn't know squat about each other. But I digress. Overall, the storyline was pretty slow to me and it didn't pick up til the last quarter. But I enjoyed that last fourth more than anything else in the book. I much preferred Catherine when she was morphing into her Red Queen persona. She was much too sweet in the rest of the book and I wish that her change into the Red Queen wasn't so swift. I think it would have been neat had we seen Red Queen tendencies pop out earlier, just to suggest that she had those qualities all along. So I didn't really buy into super sweet baker Catherine but I loved her as the vindictive Red Queen. She wasn't crazy but she was out for revenge, which I thought was totally permissible in her case. I would have liked to have read more about that Red Queen. 
 And then watch her descent into madness. 
 But that's just me."
0,Ran out of gas on this for a bit. Will return when I'm feeling Dune-y again.
3,"Going into reading this book, I had heard that the book was bad. :-/ 
 But after reading it, I thought that the storyline was good but it is a different type of style that I'm used to reading. The roots of the story are steeped in Chinese mythology and there are not a lot of fantastical elements. The setting is a mountain village in China; the characters do not have superhuman abilities. So the premise was simpler than what I was used to. However, I thought that the heroine of the book, Fei, showed courage, honesty, and bravery in the story. She showed her loyalty to her family and Li Wei. The ""forbidden love"" aspect of the story seems a bit tripe but I think that is how things went in China (according to their customs, anyway). 
 I thought overall the book was okay, but I would be hesitant about recommending the book. A very particular type of reader would enjoy this; but if the person expected lots of action and fantastic elements, they would be sorely disappointed."
4,"Despite the slow beginning and the love triangle, I really much enjoyed this book. Like the previous ones, Boundless made me laugh and hold my breath at times. I can happily give this 4 stars out of 5. 
 At the end of the book I just cried. Tears just kept on streaming down my face. I was so happy and sad and terrified that I had to read through blurred eyes. 
 I was so happy that this ended how it did. I would have liked to see a little bit more, though. (view spoiler)[ Like how Christian is doing without Clara in his life and if he really waited for her the whole time. (hide spoiler)] 
 This book was definitely more intense than Hallowed and I liked that. We got to see more about Jeffrey (which I was hoping). (view spoiler)[ I loved it when Jeffrey finally realized that he has a family that actually cares. How he protected Clara in the end from Lucy, that was awesome. (hide spoiler)] 
 And the boys... (view spoiler)[ I was relieved when Clara FINALLY decided to leave Tucker and move on with Christian because I didn't want Tucker to suffer. BUT THEN she still dreamt about Tucker which was annoying. Like, DECIDE ALREADY. When she kept appearing in Tucker's barn, I knew how this was going to end. I feel so bad for Christian because I started to like him more and more. He cared about Clara and was willing to do anything for her. So even though I'm happy that she ended up with Tucker, I'm so pissed about what Christian must be feeling. Adsfdhfksgdj this is why I hate triangles. (hide spoiler)] 
 These books have been amazing to read and I would recommend the series with no doubt :) !"
2,"(2.5 stars) 
 Really bloody and a tad too outrageous (yes, even for a vampire paranormal romance). Once the zombies appeared, it was my cue to leave."
4,"Liked it better upon reread.... 
 3.5 stars 
 This is my first Sherrilyn Kenyon book. I know I am very late to the party. 
 Overall I enjoyed this book. It is a complicated world with loads of secondary characters, tons of history to learn and lots going on. I can see that if I decide to continue I am going to need to create a spreadsheet to keep everyone straight. 
 While I liked both the hero, Kyrian, and the heroine, Amanda, I found it hard to totally get into their relationship. Why? Because they had almost none! Most of the book is spent with him denying any feelings for her and them both knowing that they can never be together. He is also tortured by his history of a wife he totally loved betraying him in the most horrible way. Plus the sex, but no climax thing for him were some of the most annoying sex scenes ever. She came off as selfish and him too easily contained (which I think he would not be if he really cared about her). 
 The beloved dead wife thing is a real dislike of mine. However, his was a real bitch so it did not bother me in this book. But there were two things that REALLY bugged me. See spoilers below for the safety gang. 
 Kyrian's baggage was heavy. It made for some frustration and while I certainly understood I find it hard to believe that in 2000 years he could not find anyone he could trust. 
 Amanda was a pretty good heroine. She handled the chaos pretty well and she kicked ass when he would not fight for them. 
 Overall, it was enjoyable, kept me interested and I plan to move to the next book in the series. 
 Safety gang (view spoiler)[ 
 Ok so there are a couple of really weird things about his dead wife (who purposely got him killed) 
 First, he is sleeping by the heroine in the very beginning, they have just met, and he snuggles with her talking in his sleep to his wife. Not a fan of that! 
 The second...the heroine is psychic. She has dreams/visions. The hero is having a nightmare remembering the night he was killed. She is in his dream seeing everything from his perspective. The course of event includes him having sex with his wife as she drugs him. It is super creepy that the heroine is experiencing this, however, she can see the coldness and evil of the heroine. She is not disturbed by the sex. For some very odd reason I am not either. I would have thought this would bother me but for some reason it was told in such a way that it really was just a part of his torture and death so it was not really sexual. (hide spoiler)]"
5,"exciting finale 
 end of parallel read with eldest - both enjoyed - not sure where we'll go next"
4,"Emery Lord arrived on the YA Contemp scene with a bang thanks to her pitch-perfect debut, Open Road Summer. The story of wild child Reagan O' Neill and her country-music superstar best friend Dee Montgomery stuck a chord with readers everywhere and was a huge summer hit when it hit shelves last year. Now Lord is back, and while friendship is again a central theme in her sophomore novel, The Start of Me and You reads quite differently to Open Road Summer. This book may be a quieter, less dramatic affair than its predecessor, but this heartfelt story has characters you will root for and the slow-burn of a sure-to-turn-swoony-perfect-match friendship that will delight hopeless romantics everywhere. 
 Aspiring screenwriter Paige Hancock doesn't want her life to be defined by tragedy, but ever since her boyfriend Aaron died, that's exactly how her life has been. Paige and Aaron may not have dated for very long, but to the people of her small town, Paige is now known as 'the girl whose boyfriend died', forever the receiver of sympathetic looks, and sad, mournful smiles. Paige will never forget her time with Aaron, the fun they had, the bond they shared, but she's ready to move on with her life. It's the start of a new school year, a time for new beginnings, new challenges, and maybe, just maybe, even a new boy.

3,"This book definitely kept me interested, but it was quite confusing. It is set in the future, when computers are omnipresent. People have many ways of interacting - in person, through ""the matrix"" (hmmmm) where they all plug into a virtual world, stimsim which is like... a video game of sorts also that you plug into, and ... I forget the name of the last thing but basically he can plug into another person and hear all her thoughts and even touch sensations (aka, he screams in pain when she breaks her leg). And the author doesn't always tell you which ""reality"" the character is in at any given time, which gets confusing. Not only that, but there is lots of new terminology for devices and realities that don't exist currently, and it's hard to keep it all straight. Also, the author has a habit of just having something happen without any explanation, which is frustrating because I'm unsure whether I should know what's going on or not (I'd give an example, but I don't have the book in front of me). 
 However, despite all this, I still enjoyed the book and it kept me reading. I think I'll have to re-read it at some point and see if it makes more sense."
4,"Not as good as CLOUD ATLAS, but still pretty good. It's a much more linear book, but you still have the different time frames and shifting POV (always first person). An interesting, exciting story which fell quite flat in the last chapter, about a dystopian world spoiled by humans. People keep predicting the end of the world one way or another, but it never comes to pass. 
 Still, definitely worth your time if you're a fan of Mitchell's, or of modern fantasy."
4,"Eeeek! That was a fun read. I have a friend that cannot read/watch stories with any children in peril, and I kept thinking, this would be THE WORST book for her! Shout out to MT weather last night, which made it possible for me to finish this one up in the house alone while the rain poured outside and the wind gusted spookily. What was that noise?! 
 This book is pretty short and the story is taut - so much DREAD. Perfect for Halloween!"
4,"Actual Rating: 3.5 stars 
 I received an eARC of this book from Netgalley. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of this review. 
 It's no secret that I'm a sucker for historical fiction so I'm ashamed to admit that this book has set on my TBR shelf for more than a year. And I Darken by Kiersten White is the first in an alternate history series that imagines Vlad the Impaler as a woman. Honestly just typing that makes me giddy. I was so excited to start this book. It's an interesting concept to take one of history's most feared men and make him a woman. I was more than a little curious to see how the author would pull it off while also staying true to what is known about the time period. 
 And I Darken follows Lada and Radu Draculesti from birth. Told in 3rd person limited, the story unfolds showing Lada's cruel nature and Radu's ""angelic"" grace. Personally I'm not a big fan of 3rd person POV, but it works well for this story and these characters. Lada is someone that you both pull for and shy away from. She is cruel, spiteful, and full of anger, yet she has her tender moments that make you realize she is someone who comes from extreme circumstances. Radu is naive, childlike, and the constant recipient of his sister's torment. There are moments you feel sorry for him and others where you wonder how he could think such things about his own flesh and blood. He is a tortured character, always struggling to find the balance between right and wrong. The chapters alternate between the siblings, giving you a clear picture of who they are. 
 I was impressed with the amount of history the author manages to place in this book. Of course liberties are taken, they have to be with Lada being a girl, but for the most part the author keeps the history accurate. If you are unfamiliar with the Ottoman Empire and the rise of Vlad the Impaler, it's an interesting read and gives a little background to this story. Lada and her brother are sold to the sultan by their father as payment to keep his throne in Wallachia. The two are only 12-ish when this happens and so they spend their formative years growing up in the sultan's care. Knowing the danger they are in, it puts an edge of suspense to their growing up. Radu is innocent and follows all that is taught to him, while Lada resists, setting her sights on returning home at the first chance. Yet neither of them could have predicted Mehmed, the sultan's son. Mehmed completes their circle. The siblings trust him and love him, yet do they really know him? 
 Overall, I was fascinated by Lada's story as it played out on the pages. I was enraged for her and cheered her on with all her small rebellions. She is truly a feminist character in a time period where women were possessions. She insists that she is not. Radu broke my heart. He is such a tortured character, first by his sister and father and now by himself as he converts to Islam and makes choices he doesn't quite understand. Seeing the characters grow from children to adults and all the trials they faced along the way made for an excellent read. If you enjoy historical fiction and political intrigue, I highly recommend it. 
 Now on to the sequel..."
5,"Harper Fox writes some of the most evocative sentences I have ever read (or in this case listened too) and this book is a most prime example of this. The lyrical beauty of the highlands and islands is so evident in this book I immediately wanted to up-sticks and move my family. Maybe it's my (maternal) Scottish side yearning to be set free - or more likely it is just the gift of a wonderfully talented author. 
 When I read (I always feel weird saying read when I technically listened to the story but it's be a bit of a PITA to clarify every time I wanted to use the word) the first thing that will make me fall in love with a book more than any other is great characters. If I fall for the characters then I am pretty much guaranteed to fall for the book. What can I say, I'm easy. And in this case I really did fall for the characters. Nichol, Cameron and of course crotchety old Harry. I adored all of them. 
 The second thing that will go a long way to make me adore a book is beautifully written surroundings. It doesn't mean the area has to be beautiful, but rather that the descriptions are, and Harper Fox has this absolutely nailed. The narrator, with his strong brogue, only added to the wonderful sense of place this story created. 
 Funnily enough I think this story could have done equally as well (better??) without the troubled past Cam was running from. The beautiful story of loss and love and need and want didn't (IMO) necessarily need the action scenes thrown in. The lily doesn't need to be gilded. It didn't make me like the story any less, but I don't think it was necessary. I would highly recommend this book to everyone."
3,"I love Reyes almost as much as Lucien. Maybe even more than Maddox. I liked how Danika became a badass while running from the Hunters and the Lords. 
 I liked how the POV changes from different characters so you get a glimpse into what is going to happen. Big shocker that Legion was (view spoiler)[ a girl!! (hide spoiler)] I imagine that Legion is a gollum type character. Gross"
5,"This was a great mystery and a satisfying read. Harper does a great job developing her characters, but also keeps the plot rolling along. I couldn't put it down. The ending surprised me, but there were enough clues throughout that it didn't feel like the reveal came out of nowhere."
3,"I like most of the concept of Poison Study, though the story really would have benefitted from a much more refined writing style. As it is now a lot of it is stilted, and I often felt robbed of a sense of world building with the way the author writes. 
 The romance does take a very distant backseat to the story, and I'm not entirely satisfied with how it played out. There's a scene where the heroine and her hero finally get together, but I honestly could not tell what I was reading beyond the fact that they kissed. There was a lot of mystical, magical mumbo jumbo that was all very vague. It could have really explored this quite a bit more, even though the timing of the coupling (was it even a coupling? I couldn't tell) was not right, story-wise. I mean, with all that was going on and the fact that they were hiding, it didn't make sense. 
 Not sure I'll be going on to the second book, as this seems to be heading into the direction of magical-girl-from-important-bloodline-who-is-a-lost-queen-or-something territory, and there really is enough of that already. Plus the sequels are overpriced, and I'm not invested enough in the story to justify spending $6+ on an ebook."
0,I just could not get through this book at all. I didn't relate to the characters at all and the writing seemed flat.
4,This book series is so weird yet so addicting at the same time. I'M HOOKED.
3,Kinda dull but I guess kinda sweet story about innocent fun.
5,"REVIEWED FOR LOVE BYTES 
 Book 2 in The Silver Tip Pack series by Megan Erickson is just as explosive and consuming as book 1 and wouldn't work well as a standalone. This is very much a continuation of the story even though it features a new couple but rest assured Bay and Nash's story is right up there with Reese and Dare's story.Megan Erickson has brought a dark reality to the shifter genre and it works really, really well. There isn't quite so much blood and gore in this one but there is still plenty of action where the Nowere's are concerned and there is also evil amongst their own and that evil has impacted hugely on Nash. It helps explain where he has been for all these years but it doesn't begin to explain the why and the why is what keeps Nash living in fear and wanting to run and hide. Secrets, so many secrets. 
 Bay's discovery of Nash is both joyful and painful. Unable to believe he has found his friend and the man he loves he can't help but ache and rage at whoever has damaged him so much. Helping him return to good health is almost the easy part - helping him face his past and come out stronger at the end almost seems impossible. Nash seems to want to run away at every turn but Bay is determined to never lose him again. When they finally come together it's explosive, hot and near perfect and the surprise ending - didn't see that coming at all! 
 The story is clever, well thought out and leaves the author with loads of exciting options on how to continue. I was equally frustrated with wanting to finish this story and never wanting it to end. Silver Tip Pack is an absolutely superb series and I cannot wait for book 3!"
5,Possibly the funniest book I've ever read. Definitely Top 5!
1,"I may as well admit right off that I didn't like this book. I knew going in that it wasn't ""for"" me, in the sense that I'm not a big fan of vampire romance. Nevertheless, this book disappointed me on a level far more profound than I had anticipated. 
 Sparkling vampires are lame, but I knew about sparkling vampires from the get go. Vampires who choose to spend eternity going to high school are lame, but I knew about this, too. Bella I has thought would be a bland cipher, since everyone talks about her as having no personality. But she was actually filled with personality, all of it unpleasant (*); but I like plenty of books with unpleasant characters, so that's not necessarily a strike against it. 
 The point is, there are many bad books, and most of them will be forgiven on the Day of Judgment. Twilight has two problems that are perhaps unforgiveable. 
 1. The squick factor 
 Bella's relationship with Edward is icky. He pushes her around, bosses her around, pays no attention to her expressed wishes, and frequently asserts he's on the verge of murdering her. 
 Now, I certainly don't think fiction is under any obligation to depict only healthy relationships. Lolita, Death in Venice, and Fowles's The Collector are all fine books about unhealthy relationships. If Meyer had wanted to depict, or even romanticize, something like this, I'm not even going to object. I'm more of an anarchist than a moralist, and don't need books to agree with me on their relationship advice. However: 
 a. Let me be clear: I don't generally think that if you're writing a book for young teenagers you should watch yourself so thoroughly. Literature is supposed to be subversive (at least I prefer it to be). There are all sorts of gender dynamics you could put into a kid's book that I may not agree with, but I still wouldn't have a problem passing along to a child. But presenting a dangerous, abusive, stalking, aged, self-confessed murderer, who may kill you at any moment, as the greatest kind of boyfriend, is probably a little irresponsible. Despite what people may think of me, I try to make some concessions to the age of the target audience. Captain Planet may be a poor cartoon in any event, but it's only because of the fact that it's aimed at children that I really think it's vile. 
 And: 
 b. There's only so much you can learn about the sexual proclivities of an author before it starts to ruin things. This is always true. Piers Anthony you can read in junior high, before your perspicacity develops enough for you to understand what he likes, and then it gets too icky. Certainly Gilbert Hernandez is right on the cusp of ruining a huge chuck of his work. 
 What I'm saying is reading Twilight taught me too much about Stephenie Meyer. 
 2. The prose 
 Meyer's prose represents a failure not only on her part, but on the whole publishing industry (as well BYU's English program). She will probably go down in history like William McGonagall as one of the worst butchers of the language. I have read my fair share of science fiction and pulps, and I had thought that I was pretty hardy, but Meyer has knocked the wind out of me. There are many bad best-selling writers, but most of them are only as bad as they have to be. Meyer is much worse. 
 I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think she may be a worse stylist than Dan Brown. 
 ""Edward's plane was landing in terminal four, the largest terminal, where most flights landed -- so it wasn't surprising that his was"" (p436). 
 So often her clauses seem to be strung together in random order. So many times she reuses the same word in sentence after sentence. Copy editors are (and are supposed to be) rabid dogs seeking to flush out and destroy even mild idiosyncrasies. Who snoozed and coasted their way through Meyer's text? 
 ""Aren't you hungry?"" he asked, distracted. 
 ""No."" I didn't feel like mentioning that my stomach was already full -- of butterflies. (p91) 
 Worst of all is that fact that in a 500-page book with almost no plot, she was allowed to pad almost every sentence with superfluous words. This is not a tight book, and I do not know why it was not made into a tight book. I think its length could have been reduced by 25-30% if someone had just recast the sentences to make them less verbose. 
 ""It was in this town that I'd been compelled to spend a month every summer until I was fourteen"" (p3). --> ""I'd been compelled to spend a month in this town every summer until I was fourteen."" 
 For anyone who cares even a little about grammar or style, it's hard to read Twilight and not feel you're getting trolled. 
 ""'Let's you and I not push poor Mike any further this week...' 
 ""'Mike-schmike,' I muttered, preoccupied by the way he'd said 'you and I.' I liked it more than *I* should"" (p103). 
 Towards the end there started to be some vampire hunting action, and I started to get a little invested in the story; I must have stopped groaning and complaining because my girlfriend wrote ""I love Edward"" on my arm in what appears to be permanent ink. But I didn't like Edward, and I didn't like Twilight. 
 ----- 
 *Since so many people assert that Bella is a dull vacuum of a character, negatively defined only, a projection of reader's characteristics, I think it is important to establish how thoroughly the book invests her with personality traits. Most of these are negative in the sense that they're ""no good"": she is consistently self-absorbed, paranoid, catty, rude, aloof, faux-humble, shallow, irritable, depressed, and judgmental.(Also clumsy.) But she is also clearly a Mary-Sue wish-fulfillment character, something people seem to overlook. 
 p210, E to B: ""You don't see yourself very clearly, you know...you didn't hear what every human male in this school was thinking on your first day...Trust me just this once -- you are the opposite of ordinary."" 
 Literally every male non-vampire character her age who gets more than one line of dialogue hits on her. She manages to sacrifice and suffer nobly (we all want to have done that!), and yet when you look at it, her ""literal...personal Hell"" is not that bad (even better!). And she really is better than every other human character at everything that does not involve coordination. Her mastery of human dynamics lets her understand who has crushes on whom, and subtly guide them towards each other. Without her around her mother literally can't find her clothes, while her father can't prepare a meal without Bella babystepping him through it (she has to explain to him twice (once in writing) where the cold cuts she buys for him are). In Port Angeles, her fashion advice for her durpy friends is cogent (and immediately taken!), and she sends them off to be lesser people together while she alone looks for a book store. And of course she sneers at all the inferior people around her constantly, casually noting their bad skin and bad perms. 
 The funniest parts, I think, are when she remarks on how much better she is at school than all her peers: ""Bronte, Shakespeare, Chaucer, Faulkner. I'd already read everything"" (p15). 
 Talking to Mike about the Macbeth paper he had stupidly forgotten about: ""I didn't add that l was finished with it -- no need to sound smug"" (p143). No need, indeed! 
 She finishes her bio lab (with Edward) in record time and then condescendingly has to try to ""appear attentive"" as the teacher explains ""what [she] had seen without difficulty through the microscope"" (pp50-51). ""Without difficulty"" are the watchwords here. 
 It's possible that in future books she is ""given"" less, but in the first book she is actually fleshed out, and, furthermore, overwhelmingly displayed in a positive light (despite being incredibly annoying)."
3,"2.5 
 I wanted to love this book - but I just couldn't connect to the characters. I don't know if it was the format or something else. The concept and idea was great but I think that it was just not my thing."
3,"So I have to categorize this one as ""good but not for me."" I understand why people like it, and I warmed up to it by the end, but that didn't undo the fact that the first half was a slog. 
 Also, I think I just keep forgetting that I don't really like high fantasy."
2,"Hated 400 pages of the book and found interesting the last 100. I thought more than once to stop reading it but I forced myself to continue and the end was good. I don't think the end was so good that made me forget the rest of the book, but it gave some much needed explanations and it had a great surprise."
5,"What an amazing start to the series this book blew my expectations away. It is a multi perspective young adult tale that centres mostly around two best friends. One who is a truthwitch which is rare in this kingdom and if anyone knew they would want her and a threadwitch who can not make threadstones. 
 The world building in this book is amazing as well as the character building it is a great story of friendship and magic and prophecy I really enjoyed reading it and I am highly looking forward to the next one which I will be starting as soon as this review is done. 
 Susan Dennard took me on a high action ride with this tale. It also has a highly realistic romance and great side characters. Definitely a good book for fans of ACOTAR, ACOMAF and ACOWAR."
2,"I really wanted to love The Summer I Found You. It has such a gorgeous cover, and the synopsis sounded so intriguing and I loved the fact that Aidan wasn't a regular YA hero. He was flawed, he's come back from Afghanistan with one less arm, and is having to deal with everything that encompasses going to war. And I really, really liked Aidan. I liked seeing his journey, I liked the fact he had a lot of stuff to deal with and I enjoyed seeing him deal with it, and try to move on with his life now that he's no longer a soldier. 
 Initially I even liked Kate, although her fawning over Shelton drove me nuts. She was cute, though, and I liked that when she and Aidan first meet she literally says anything, including ""What does the other guy look like"" in regards to Aidan's missing arm. It was a bit thoughtless, but it also showed that she didn't care about his missing arm, and wouldn't tiptoe around it. My problem came with the whole diabetes thing. I've never seen someone have such a blase attitude towards a disease as serious as diabetes. Who CARES if you carry a pharmacy in your bag so long as you're healthy? Considering what Aidan is going through, a little diabetes is hardly a world-ender, not to compare their problems or make it whose problem is worse. But when you hear about Aidan's friend dying next to him, it sort of made me feel that Kate was just being stupid with regards to her disease. 
 I get it, it's probably not cool to stick needles in yourself or have people know your business, but I'd rather everyone know my business then pass out or get super dizzy. Because there was just no need for that. It just got me SO FRUSTRATED. Literally boiling with rage. It completely ruined my enjoyment of seeing her and Aidan get closer and closer, because all I could think about was the fact she was playing with fire with her insulin and stuff. 
 I wanted a really fun summer read - the cover promises as much, but it wasn't that and while I really appreciated learning more about Aidan and everything he's been through, Kate was just too silly and immature for me to really love this book."
4,"Ah, quick and daring, just like I like my HRs! I'm rapidly becoming a Lorraine Heath fan. I LOVE her complex and intriguing characters and I especially love how she continues with the descendants of these characters!!! I clearly missed a set of novels though because this one threw me off with a few of the couples who were babies during the Scoundrels series (ex: Duke of Lovingdon). So I'll have to go back and catch up - which is something my OCD self has to do!! 
 ADDED: HA!!! Found a guide to the St. James Scoundrels, Scandals and Hellions series on Lorraine Heath's page! I've got some catching up to do! 
 St. James Character Guide 
 Anyway, LOVED this book!!! I will admit that at first Ashe bothered me with his photographs of legs thing and his initial philosophy of women, but he quickly grew on me as I learned more about his difficulty dealing with the violent loss of his parents at such a young age. I thoroughly enjoyed 
 Edward's character and Loche's character intrigues me as he was very seldom seen. 
 I also couldn't get enough of Minerva as I empathized with her so much! And she was so strong and opinionated and didn't back down from doing what she felt was right. Her character was so refreshing! LOVE strong female MCs! 
 And the ending... OH so sweet! Can't wait to read Edward and Loche's stories - but first need to read the last three books in the Scoundrels series and then Scandalous Gentlemen series! WEEE!!!"
2,"***2.5 Stars*** 
 This book was a string of poorly thought out, rash decisions. The plot, the setup, the whole shebang just wasn't logical. Had there been an alternate motive, had the author took this in a different direction, had there been more then maybe, just maaaaaybe, it would have jived better. 
 Unfortunately, it was not meant to be. 
 The ""bad"" guys were bad in a way that made no sense. Like none. Their actions were completely counter to their supposed goal. 
 Our protagonist is an annoying 20/21 year old who acts like a 15 yo yet somehow manages to be the most bad ass out of the characters. 
 Really? Really? 
 How much is a life worth? 
 I don't know about a life, but I can tell you my time is worth a helluva lot more than this book."
4,"As always this book was a great read however can I take a second to complain about how annoying it is that books keep being added to this series. When the first book came out it was only supposed to be 2 books, then 3 and now there is to be a fourth. Vlad is fun and the series is great but how come he gets more books than Slade and Mencheres? Honestly I would love more books in the Nighthuntress series or in the Nighthuntress world series."
4,"This book starts right up where the last one left off, with Allie, her father, and Stone traveling into death's realm to rescue Zayvion's soul. She succeeds, but at a terrible price, having to sacrifice the magic that belonged to her soul. As dangerous as things are for her in that realm, those dangers pale in comparison to what awaits her when she returns. Some of the most powerful veiled have gotten a hold of the disks that were charged with the wild magic. These disks give them corporeal bodies and make them almost indestructible since they can draw on magic without any price at all. Allie might just have to do something she vowed never to do to make it out of this mess alive, trust her father. 
 This book seemed like it was the calm before the storm, without really being calm. There was plenty of danger and action, but with the war really starting to brew, I fear they have only scraped the edge of what is in store. Not only do the remaining members of the Authority have to deal with the ones who rebelled, but also a new unknown threat that seems to have followed Allie out of the gate. They seem to be getting it from all sides, and it will be a miracle if the small band is able to hold things together. I think they might just have to rethink their idea of closing everyone outside of their circle. They will need all the help they can get, and there are several magic users that could really be useful if the members of the Authority only allow them to help. I guess only time will tell if their stubbornness holds, or they give in and do the right thing. 
 I really missed the interaction between Zayvion and Allie in this book. I understand the man was in a coma for most of it, but I just wish there could have been a little more time spent together. Their relationship is one of my favorite things about the series, and it made this book seem to be a little lacking compared to the rest. That being said however, I did enjoy the increased time with her friends Shame and Terric. I'm not sure the two will ever be able to be completely at peace with each other. However, with that being said, they did make major strides at being able to at least work together without killing the other person. Who knows, maybe someday a miracle will happen and Shame will pull his head out of his butt, anything is possible. 
 Overall, this felt like a transition book, but still had plenty of action to keep me entertained. Some questions were answered about her father and his ""use"" for her. His continued manipulation and use of her without her permission makes him really hard to trust, especially since he keeps his true motives always hidden from her. I just hope that somehow his ultimate plan ends up being for the good of the world and Allie. Hey, I can dream right? All in all, I enjoyed the book, and I look forward to the next one, especially if there is more quality time between Allie and Zayvion. I have a feeling things are headed to crazy town and the next book should be pretty jammed packed."
3,"3.5 stars 
 As long as this was it felt a little incomplete. I liked the progress that was made but I think I expected a little more. I'm left with more questions than I went into this one with in a way. Actually reading Kayden's issue was a bit of a struggle. I felt bad for him so many times. I wanted better for him but I understand it's a process so I wasn't upset seeing him struggle so much. I wanted more for Callie but her progress was really good. For her I kind of expected a different outcome but what happened wasn't bad at all. 
 I also find it crazy that all of them have issues but I'm really curious about Luke and the life he has to deal with."
1,"Easy to read, but as I expected, not really my thing. I'm happy I gave it a try though!"
4,"This book reminded me very much of the fantasy worlds of Tamora Pierce, with its fighters, mages, and politics, particularly the Beka Cooper series and the Protector of the Small series. But I didn't feel that Lidell's first book was derivative--just that it shared some similarities of world-building. I loved the way she developed the characters from start to finish. Although the book stands on its own, there was enough foreshadowing to make me hope there are further books about these people in our future!"
3,"A decent story, very fast paced once you get past the initial chapters. Hopefully the second volume is a little more meatier."
2,"Okay, I'm going to hide most of my review because I need to get specific about why this book is so god damn depressing. 
 (view spoiler)[ First, perpetually depressed woman has several affairs. 
 Second, she doesn't even really love one of her three children. 
 Third, the child she loves the most dies in a freak accident. 
 Fourth, her husband beats her senseless when he finds out about the affairs. 
 Fifth, she kills herself. That is literally the last line in the book. (hide spoiler)] 
 Yes, don't read this if you're looking for something to cheer you up."
5,"I thought it was really well written. The main character Alice Lindgren, is based on Laura Bush. I don't know all that much about Laura Bush's life, but American Wife made me curious about her. I like the narrator's introspection, and inner dialogue. I found myself enjoying the entire book, all the characters were developed well, from Alice's slightly eccentric grandmother, to her childhood friend Dena. I find myself rereading certain parts, and this is definitely a book I'd read again, perhaps just to see how it ages."
4,"I enjoyed this WAY more than I expected to. A fun, fast read with likable characters and several chuckle out loud moments."
5,"Goddard keeps the momentum going with another excellent Season 8 volume. This book probably does the best of the series so far is capturing the tone on the series and backs that up with a very enjoyable story and some nice character development. 
 Fantastic work."
4,"A remarkable look into what destroys us. 
 Definitely recommended reading for anyone who wants to explore the things that have threatened, and continue to threaten humanity."
5,"While I enjoyed this immensely, I can't help but think it ended... weirdly. Who were the cops? Why did they show up? What happened to the mice? What IS the question?! 
 Overall very amusing."
4,"This post also appeared on Wayward Kitsune. 
 As of this time, By Your Side is my most favorite Kasie West book followed by The Distance Between Us. The whole time that I was reading this book, I cannot stop grinning from ear to ear. Who wouldn't want to be locked in a library with a cute and mysterious hottie? I know, I wouldn't mind (except the part where there's no food and no changing of undies, ugh) especially if there's a chance of cuddling with the mentioned hottie. Ha. Anyway, horniness aside, there's so much more about By Your Side than your feel good contemporary romance YA. The book tackled deep issues like anxiety disorder, child neglect, loneliness, conquering fears, and trust. These things may sound heavy but trust me, Kasie West still managed to make By Your Side as fluffy as possible. 
 If you know me, I am more inclined to read angsty books than fluffy ones but Kasie West's books really get me. And By Your Side was no exception. Although it kind of disappointed me that it wasn't about books (because hello! Most of the story took place inside a library), I was glad that the wonderful characters (I totally ship Dax and Autumn), the plot, the romance development, and the various issues tackled in the book made up for that. 
 I'm definitely looking forward to more Kasie West books. But before that, I must read P.S. I Like You first. 
 Thank you for providing yours truly a free copy, Edelweiss!"
1,"Well, well I was quite disappointed with this book. I had high expectations which were definitely not met. 
 First of all, I could not connect with characters. I did not hate them, I did not love them. I just could not connect with them. Secondly, everything was happening too quickly with not enough explanations. I had a feeling that author did not spend enough time with building the engaging storyline and something was missing all the time. Moreover, I was expecting some really juicy scenes but to be honest, there are so many other books with much hotter scenes out there. Even though I was able to finish it without some serious harm, I will not continue with series since I see it as waste of time and money. 
 And one more thing. Everyone compares this book to Fifty series. There were definitely plenty of similarities but for me it was only poor imitation of Fifty Shades. And while I liked Ana, I found Eva really irritating and naive. And even though Gideon is described as sexy possesive billionare, he was lacking some charisma from my point of view. Maybe I should not compare this book to Fifty series, but I just could not help."
1,"I'm not giving any stars because I wouldn't have made it past the second chapter if it weren't for the hype for the entire series. I'll make up my mind after I've read all three books. 
 It was quite bad, though. Attempted rape, forced oral sex (which IS rape) and physical abuse aren't the best ways to form a healthy relationship. I'm not even going to go into the racist undertones, as people have talked at length about that. 
 It did get better in the second half, in a ""let's pretend what happened before doesn't have any long lasting consequences"" way. I'm not that willing to forget, but it might make the reading of books 2 and 3 slightly more tolerable. 
 EDIT: i've finished the series and i have a question to anyone who loves it: why?"
4,"Wow, Anne is a principal now! I think this series is starting to lose momentum, but Anne of Windy Poplars was still a great addition to the story."
4,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this one. I had started getting into KA's Rock Chick series but kinda fell off when things started getting a little redundant with the whole hardheaded damsel in distress in every single one of the 3 books I read. I loved the first one but after that not so amusing anymore. Point is, I was afraid this would be more of the same. 
 Thankfully, I can say this was certainly not the case - big phew. And have to say I really liked this book, possibly even more than the first Rock Chick. Same alpha male atmosphere of hotness (and Shy is pretty damn hot) just like Lee Nightingale (lord knows I love me some Lee!) but without the over the top female heroine drama. Tabby's a pretty good character, sometimes she's a bit stubborn but she does what's right in the context of the life she's in. She's strong, I like it! 
 I dug the time lapses KA put in, very effective and you don't feel at all like you're missing pieces of the story. In fact, the passage of time makes it better, more realistic. This book rocks, 4.5 stars!"
4,"""I was one hundred percent not in control of this situation. This girl fucking owned me right now. I sat on that bed waiting for her to give me the time of day. I didn't necessarily like this feeling, but I suffered through it... for her. I convinced myself that I'd probably suffer through pretty much anything for this girl."" 
 ""ANYONE SEEN MY KITTEN?"" 
 ""Kitten, I'd break my fucking pitching arm if it meant keeping you safe."" 
 Cassie is new to college. So when she laid her eyes on infamous manwhore superstar of baseball pitcher Jack Carter. He never sleeps with the same girl twice. Everyone knows it. She stay away from him but Jack is persistent to get her attention that lead to something. 
 Cassie has trust issues because her father has let her down with broken promises. Jack has never had a real relationship. But they tried together. 
 The Perfect Game was a good read. 4 KITTEN STARS! I really enjoyed it but was frustrated at certain points. I loved watching their relationship grow. I loved Jack. He's sweet but he made some dumb decisions. He made a HUGE mistake. I salute Cassie for her forgiving nature though. 
 Can't wait for The Game Changer! 
 ""Kitten, 
 Letting go of someone who owns your heart is hard. 
 Sometimes holding on to that person is even harder. I 
 know I'm not the easiest person to love, but you are. 
 I'ts not that I can't live without you; it's that I don't want to. There's a difference. We all make choices in life and I choose you. 
 My heart belongs to you. And I'm not asking for it back, even if you don't want it anymore. I'm just asking for the chance to have yours again. I promise I'll be more careful with it this time. 
 Love Always, 
 Jack"""
5,"FOR MORE REVIEWS AND GIVEAWAYS, DO CHECJK OUT MY BLOG: 
 Foreplay 
 I LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH! 
 Reece was to put it lightly, one of the hottest male leads I have ever known. 
 ""I wouldn't have waited this long for you. I would have already showed up at your dorm the minute I decided I wanted you. I wouldn't leave until I convinced you that you were mine."" 
 I also loved the fact that Reece was not like the typical male lead. Typical being, a playboy and all. 
 He was caring, a little bit arrogant and had a great sense of humour. 
 The plot was not that unique but boy was it fun to read. It made me want to go to Disneyland with my boyfriend too.(Not that I have one. Nerd Life!) 
 All in all, it was a fantastic read that would make you wanting for more."
2,"This was like part Twilight, part Mediator and part Gemma Doyle, which made it much less interesting to me, since it had all kind of been done before. It started off pretty well, but kinda just went downhill from there; I liked Ever, the main character okay, and I was intrigued by her back story, which you don't really get details on until near the end of the book. Actually, I found that pretty frustrating, considering how much guilt-wallowing she did over how her family's deaths were all her fault. The payoff just wasn't there after that much of a build up. And then...well, the whole super-hot guy that's inexplicably interested in the main character, but sometimes acts like she doesn't exist, only it's too late because she fell completely in love at first sight plot? Ughhhh. In general, the characters just didn't have much depth, and their actions didn't always make much sense, and as a whole, I just found the entire thing a little too melodramatic and angsty and underdeveloped for my taste. But if you like that sort of thing, you'll probably love this series. I won't be continuing it though."
5,"Loved this book... 
 P R O S: 
 - Ruby was a badass protagonist. I can't stand to read a book where I'm annoyed with the main character so Bracken did something right; even if I didn't agree with some of Ruby's decisions (view spoiler)[ like friCKING ERASING LIAM'S MEMORIES (hide spoiler)] I understood her reasoning. 
 - LIAM. It was so refreshing to have a male love interest who wasn't brooding around all the time. 
 - The side characters were easy to relate to and had interesting background. Each individual character was awesome 
 - Cute relationships and not just the romantic ones. 
 - Witty dialogue aka everything that comes out of chubs' mouth 
 C O N S: 
 - That one part in the book where they are just driving around and the pace slows down - I was just waiting for something to happen. But nothing did for a while. 
 - Too many unanswered questions: HOW DID THEY GET IAANS? DO ALL KIDS HAVE IT? WHY WAS NO ONE IN THE BOOK CONCERNED WITH THESE THINGS? WHAT HAPPENED TO SAM? 
 - That really vague scene with Clancy and Ruby. (view spoiler)[Did I really read a rape scene? Or am I blowing things out of proportion? (hide spoiler)] 
 Overall, a really good book. Would recommend!"
2,"I'm not sure how I feel about this book. It was a mix of romance, alternate history, science fiction, fantasy, and gossipy-type chick lit. You can more or less surmise the writing style from the author's quick bio on the back of the book: 
 ""Ms. Carriger writes steampunk urbane fantasy comedies of manners to cope with being raised in obscurity by an expatriate Brit and an incurable curmudgeon. She escaped small town life and inadvertently acquired several degrees in Higher Learning. She then traveled the historic cities of Europe, subsisting entirely on biscuits secreted in her handbag. She now resides in the Colonies, surrounded by a harem of shoes, where she insists on tea imported directly from London and cats that pee into toilets."" 
 There were points when I felt that Ms. Carriger was relying too much on her quippy, irreverent narrative style, leaving the actual content of the novel somewhat lacking. It focused too much on ridiculing the mundane particulars of the world and showed the author's preoccupation with writing to assert the heroine's clear superiority to her surroundings -- Alexia Tarabotti is simply too smart, too self-assured, and too complex for Victorian society! 
 To further ughhh matters, it was all but painfully obvious that Alexia was a very flimsy stand-in for the author herself. I am basing this supposition on the fact that the style and voice of the bio above are indistinguishable from those of Alexia's in the book. This made the novel read, in some places, like a self indulgent enacting of Ms. Carriger's fantastical fantasies. Which is not objectively a bad thing, I suppose. I just don't like it when I can see strings being pulled in the book I'm reading; it makes me feel like the author is bad at pulling them. 
 All that being said, I was entertained. A little less so in the middle of the book, where I felt it began to lag a little bit, but still. If pressed, I'd say I liked it. I don't think I'll be continuing the series, but who knows?"
4,"A beautiful and nice summer read, with a touch of Gilmore Girls. I liked Caymen a lot, she has become one of my favourite heroines in YA romances. And Xander, well, I would love to see that smile that could bring peace to a war. 
 Highly recommended if you like such books as Anna and the French Kiss :)"
4,"Well written, as if this were the chronicles of a village. Gave me a fresh view of missionaries in Africa. Anyone reading this in 1959 must have blown out of the water."
4,"A fresh, lyrical retelling, spun from the golden thread of legendary Achilles. Breathes life into the Iliad's warriors."
1,"Maybe it's because I didn't read the first four books of this series, but this story was seriously annoying. The comedy was incredibly forced, the behavior was unrealistically juvenile, the love story was completely lacking in chemistry. Just nothing to recommend this. 
 This is a long running series with high ratings (including this book, so I can only surmise that the earlier ones are similar), so it must be pretty successful. Beats me as to why. I'm clearly not the reader these stories were written for. 
 Many other readers clearly like it, though, so while I can't recommend it, I don't discourage anyone from giving it a try. But look for a sale or freebie."
2,"Having only read Ugly Love and the Never Never series by Colleen Hoover (and having loved both), I pegged myself as a CoHo lover. I'm nowhere near the thousands of fans who hang on to her every word and have read her every book but I did like her work (the ones I've read) and Confess was a book I was super excited for. 
 And in case my rating doesn't make it very clear, I was not too impressed by this book. 
 I'm a bit late to the party--okay I'm pretty damn late--but I tend to read hyped books only after the hype does down. I don't read them when they just come out and I most definitely don't indulge myself in reading the 2865739 positive reviews they have on Goodreads. And with Confess, even though I'd pre-ordered it, I read this book almost 6 months after it first came out. I'd love to say that Auburn and Owen ""love story"" made me all mushy and melted my heart, but I was indifferent to them throughout the book. Owen was weird and kind of quirky (which I liked) but Auburn was...honestly, this girl was an idiot. 
 For starters, this book read more like an Adult book, than New Adult. I know that in the long run it makes no difference but if a book is pitched as NA, I'd like to see some NA. I'd like to see the characters behaving their age, and Confess just couldn't do that for me. I couldn't see any of their chemistry, the secondary characters were a joke, and of course, to add to the crap in the book, there was this shit: 
 ""What the hell am I doing? I don't do this kind of thing. I don't invite guys into my home. Texas is turning me into a whore."" 
 If it wasn't for the beautiful pieces of art in this book, the insta-love and immaturity of the characters in it would have made me run away screaming a long time ago. Owen's paintings are a beauty and I don't regret buying this book only because of the paintings. His paintings were inspired by anonymous confessions that people left at his doorstep and I loved that idea! I wish I could be that talented too. 
 All in all, a very disappointing, very unfulfilling story with a sham of characters and an ending that made me want to commit bloody murder. 
 Find more reviews @ Rhea's Neon Journal."
4,"This series is fantastic and while I enjoyed this book, it wasn't on the same level as the others I'd give this a 3.5 out of 5 stars. 
 The reason I didn't enjoy this was mainly because Rose was a sad sap and off on a bat shit crazy mission that didn't really start until half way through the book. 
 There are ALOT of flash back scenes that weren't in the other books but I didn't see the point in reading about them. Also all the re capping gets old quick. I get that this would have been useful for people that hadn't read the book one after the other but it really bugged me that I had to rad about crap we already knew. WE HAD MORE PRESSING MATTERS AT HAND RACHELLE GET TO THE FIGHTING PLEASE. 
 Rose: 
 Rose was so grief stricken, I felt for her I truly did but after a while I was just bored of it, I understand she was going through a lot but I just wanted her to be back to strong Rose again. 
 Lissa 
 Even though we weren't at school with her we could still see what she was doing thanks to Rose's bond. Lissa has made a new friend out of Avery and I hated it so much I felt like jealous Rose from book 2 and wanted Avery and her creepy brother out! (view spoiler)[ Avery was such an evil bitch but taking her down was one of my favourite scenes. Seeing all 4 spirit uses tap into each other and help strengthen each other was amazing and I didn't even feel bad when Avery's mind snapped on it's self (hide spoiler)] 
 Christian 
 Ah poor Christian. Christian is such a great character I can't find one thing in him I dislike (view spoiler)[ Seeing Lissa cheat hurt and I new something was horribly wrong but I just wanted everyone to make up. Lissa's stubborn and even though she cares for Christian she doesn't have it in her to be the first to run back (hide spoiler)] 
 Dimitri 
 Dimitri was just as terrifying as I imagined. Super strong, Fast, and evil as anything and really creepy. (view spoiler)[ All the 'loving' moments and capturing Rose was just weird and made me feel so uncomfortable (hide spoiler)] 
 Adrian is such a ball of crazy mixed in with great I love his personality and take on everything. He's a great friend underneath all of his vices and tough guy act and I really felt for him. 
 The ending of this book was completely crazy, but really by now how could I expect anything less of this series?"
5,4.5 stars. This one was better than #4. Non-depressed Charley is better Charley.
2,"I would give this 2.5 stars. I might be done with this series, as I seem to get more disappointed with each book. Also I thought this was the last book, so I persevered through all 500 pages of this overly long and boring book just so I could find out what happened at the end. Only to get to the end and realize that it is not over yet. The book wasn't all terrible, and there were moments that I liked. I think there is a good story with potential here. But a lot of it felt like Aveyard was just filling pages. A lot of pages. I think this could have been 200 pages shorter! I also didn't care one bit about the chapters from the perspectives of Evangeline or Cameron. I have to admit I am just a bit curious still as to how this story will eventually end. Curious enough to wade through another endlessly long book? I'm not sure yet."
4,"4.5 stars 
 I didn't enjoy this book as much as the first. And that only for one reason: Lia kissed three different guys throughout the whole book and I was so annoyed with that. And she has feelings for two of them, but agreed to marry the third...?! Argh I was so confused ... 
 But the story, the mystery, the betrayal, the language, the setting etc was perfect as ever."
3,Dystopian thriller-romance. No need to say any more.
2,"This book was sweet and cute and clean - basically a generic romance for teens. It just didn't have that WOW factor. The plot line is one that's overused and Hawthorne does nothing new with it here. Girl likes Douchebag guy. Sweet guy likes girl. Girl takes awhile, but eventually realizes Douchebag guy is a douchebag and falls for the sweet guy. Happily ever after. 
 Kate was one of the most oblivious and idiotic romantic heroines I've ever read. She met Brad (her brother's college roommate) once and ""fell in love"" with him. Right from the start she can't give any reasons why she's head over heels for him except that he's hot. She even says ""What else is there?"" when her Aunt asks her what other reasons she has for liking Brad. 
 The setting for this book is a ski resort where Kate and her two friends (all high school seniors) have to share a 3-bedroom condo with her brother Sam and his two friends (Brad and Joe). Brad is the roommate that Kate has a crush on. 
 As soon as Brad enters the picture it's made VERY obvious that he's a complete dirtbag. One of his first lines is about how his favorite things are ""driving fast and kissing babes."" He hooks up another girl on the very first night of their vacation and moves in to the other girl's house for the duration. His lines are all skeevy and douchebaggy, he moved in with another girl, and Kate still thinks he's the most amazing thing since sliced bread. 
 Enter Joe. The other friend of her brother's. It's made VERY obvious from the start that Joe has a thing for Kate. He's super sweet, super attentive, flirtatious with her, asks her on a date, kisses her, and is generally awesome. But she is wishy washy about it for the majority of the book (gotta get conflict SOMEWHERE I suppose). 
 It bugs me that authors don't realize the best characters are not 100% evil or 100% good. Making Brad a complete tool and making Joe Mr. Perfect makes them BOTH boring. There was never any 'love triangle' or any reason for the reader to ever believe that Kate wouldn't come to her senses and go for Joe instead of Brad. 
 I had two other issues with the book. 
 1) Were they or weren't they all having sex? It's kind of implied that they were. ALL of them. Kate's friend Allie sleeps in the same bed as Sam. Kate's other friend Leah moves in with a ski instructor for the duration of the vacation. Brad moves in with his new girlfriend. Kate sleeps in the same bed as Joe. While there isn't any explicit mention of sex, it's kind of implied that everyone is pretty much doing it like jackrabbits and that's something that annoys me in a YA novel - especially one that is otherwise packaged as a sweet and clean romance. 
 2) The ""Kate-have-a-good-time fund"" .... DROVE ME ABSOLUTELY NUTS. How many times did this saying need to be uttered? ZERO in my opinion, but instead it's brought up OVER AND OVER AND OVER. I know it's minor, but I admit I have occasional pet peeves and this is one of them. 
 Overall, the book was just mediocre. I didn't hate it, but I didn't like it that much either."
4,"It was years ago whenI read this one and with this book i had met with Stephen King. I still remember emotions I experinced with girl and his father' s survival and struggle with the world except them, that was amazing and tastefull!"
4,"""I smell him. Have to find out where he gets that cologne. I think it's called Fear."" 
 I was going to rate this book 3 stars. I already knew what happened to Melinda so the ending was spoiled for me (damn you Tumblr!). I wanted to get to that part so I rushed the first half of the book. It was my fault and I'm sorry. The ending though was what convinced me to add the fourth star. 
 ""I have survived. I am here. Confused, screwed up, but here. So, how can I find my way?"" 
 Melinda is a character you end up caring for. She's in pain, she hides a secret she's frightened to share with the world. She gets bullied and betrayed. Everybody sees she's unwell but nobody cares. It was just heartbreaking and unfair. Her journey is an awful one, she has to face her former friends growing up without her, hating her for a fault she doesn't have, and has to face the cause of her nightmares everyday at school. When she gets better it is because she decides to get better, she is tired of being passive, of being the scared rabbit who runs away when things get bad. She rationalizes her pain, understands she's been through something bad and that she's not accountable for it. Someone else must pay, someone else who's not afraid to hurt other people just like he hurt her. 
 ""I said no."" 
 I loved her journey and I loved the ending. This is a book everybody should read. It gives you a clear perspective on a situation that, if you're lucky, you've never experienced and never will. You need to read this book because this is the XXI century and we boast about how civilized we've become but there are still people who don't understand the gravity of a situation like Melinda's and who still try to blame people like her. I'm just so tired of seeing mindless people giving opinions about things they don't know or care about and this is why I would recommend this book to anyone."
3,"Verdict: Miserable. And not in a good way. 
 Let's get one thing straight. I loved book one and I'm still pumped for book 3. Unfortunately this is a bridging story full of side plots. It was the aftermath of book 1 and the build up to book 3, and there's one word to describe it. 
 Miserable. 
 What wasn't miserable was a half-happy memory, scarred by the dystopian world. That in itself is pretty despondent. 
 The beautiful prose made it sound like a reminiscent drone, and the scales were tipped towards pretentious in this book. Personally I didn't connect with it like I did the last time. In particular, I never really understood the many references to bees. 
 Life became grey for me when reading this. Well alright, the prose was beautiful so let's say a shade of greyish lilac. 
 So life was crap before and it's crap now. And it's only getting crapper. The people in their world don't even want to fix the issue. In fact, they'd rather kill more innocent bystanders than do that... 
 I just found it hopeless and impossible to connect with. If you don't give me anything to look forward to, nothing to believe in, and only show me disappointment, I'll put the book down - I'll do it. The only thing that kept me going was how short it was and how much I loved book one. 
 It ended in a typical book two style. The last paragraph leads into the next book, and it was probably the best, happiest, most exciting thing to occur in the entire title. It wasn't worth the read to get there, although now I will have to read the final in the series. Hopefully before I lose faith in the world.

5,"I stayed up way too late last night (yeah, like... nearly 3:00am) but I finished the book!!! ;D 
 This is such a good book! When I started reading, I wasn't so sure I was going to be able to say that. As the story progressed, though, I found myself liking it more and more. I also found myself crying... With a book like this, I think crying is inevitable, but that's okay. I also laughed. And sighed. It really is a very deep story rather than just being a light, fluffy read. 
 The story line was very interesting. Call me weird, but I have always been fascinated by tuberculosis and that is one reason I wanted to read this book in the first place. And I really liked the characters too. They were frustrating at times, but that is so realistic (after all, who do you know that doesn't have their frustrating moments?) and it didn't keep me from loving them just the same. 
 I did mostly figure out the mystery behind the harassment before anyone in the story even contemplated that option, but parts of it were still quite a surprise. And I don't mind figuring out the mystery early as long as the characters aren't being ridiculously dense and ignoring obvious clues in order to drag out the story. That wasn't the case in this book. I thought it was all resolved quite well. 
 As for the romance aspect of the story. Pretty tense at moments... and so sweet at others. I loved how it all turned out. And the epilogue? Perfect. Epilogues are very important to me. Sometimes, it can either make or break a story for me-- causing me to add a star or remove one. This one caused me to add one. I mean, I really liked the story already, but the epilogue just made it great. I couldn't have asked for a better one. 
 Overall, a very satisfying read."
4,"The second book of the Turner Brothers trilogy was as enjoyable as the first. 
 Mark Turner has become a celebrity of 1840s London--and finds the experience not to his taste at all. His practical guide on chastity has delivered fame and a knighthood even as he suspects that few have actually read the darn thing--how can they when they keep ascribing things to him that he's never said or even implied. Finding himself beset by fans wherever he goes and unable to get to know a girl without her life being turned inside out, London's most famous virgin decides a little time in the country might let things die down for a while. 
 Jessica Farleigh, on the other hand, is weary of the life of a courtesan. Scarred by abuse and ready to retire, she is hoping to cash in on an offer by one of Mark's enemies. Her job is to seduce and ruin Mark in a public scandal so that he will be removed from consideration for a remunerative government post. Her last reserves of cash are running low, but how hard can it be to seduce a virgin? 
 Again, we see Milan's forte play out here: real, legitimate obstacles where both the obstacles and the victory over them flow naturally from the characters. Jessica and Mark fall in love (duh, this is a romance) but how can they possibly reconcile their completely disparate worlds? 
 The dialogue in this book was fantastic, and I was pleasantly surprised to find Mark's discourse as scholarly as it should be. It's rare to get a character purported to be a historical philosopher actually able to present his points rationally and in the logical language of his day. It's clear that Mark is a practical intellectual from how he says things as much as by what he says. Milan pulls this off so naturally that you'd never know how hard it is to write without leaving modern audiences behind. Even better, Jessica is able to keep up with Mark, even though it's clear she hasn't had the advantages of his training. This, too, is pulled off so naturally we never doubt for a moment the reality of their interactions. 
 A note on Steamy: I'm not going to say if there are any actual sex scenes in the book. I'll just say that Mark behaves exactly how you'd expect a man of strong conviction to behave when he is presented with strong temptation. And yeah, there's some strong temptation. My personal steamometer measures this book on the high end, on par with Unveiled."
5,"This is emotionally brutal, yet still hopeful. There is a lot to consider here when it comes to choices, mistakes, consequences, and forgiveness. The story breaks down a whole community of people, and you get to watch while they struggle to rebuild themselves. So that's hard, but it's truthful, relevant, and thoughtful. I couldn't look away. 
 Pages: 384"
5,"This is such a must-read for anyone who ever saw and loved ""Silence of the Lambs."" Thomas Harris is an amazing writer and ""Hannibal"" really fleshes out the characters of Lecter and Clarice Starling in a satisfying way, while still leaving some of that mystery that makes them so fascinating intact. 
 One of my favorite things in this cat and mouse tale as Clarice pursues Hannibal is the way their characterizations are built delicately around secondary characters who, the way Thomas Harris writes them, are always thrilling on their own. From a brother and sister trapped in a twisted situation, the horrors of World War Two, to corrupt supervisors at the FBI, this book is built around injustice, and Hannibal Lecter's personal way of exacting revenge on those who target the weak. Just brilliantly written and great for anyone who loves horror. Read in the daytime with happy flowers around :)! 4.5/5 stars."
4,"I was NOT expecting the story to go in this direction. It's not that it was terribly surprising from a plot perspective, but rather that the author was brave enough to go to such bleak places. The first several chapters of the first book had me cringing in anticipation of a teen-angst, trope fest. Then, suddenly, it becomes awesome. Days of Blood & Starlight picks up days from where Daughter of Smoke and Bone left off. So, essentially, the central character has just learned about the genocide of her people. So yes, this is a dark, depressing chapter in these characters' lives, and we're offered very few reprieves. By the time Issa showed up, I needed her. I needed Karou to have one unabashed chimera ally. I do wish we'd spent a bit more time with the displaced and hunted chimera, but it felt as though the author made the choice to spend more time fleshing out the seraphim, who were a peripheral menace in the first story. Definitely necessary. I also loved the character growth of Liraz. And this has been a terrible stream-of-consciousness that makes little sense. But I loved the book, and can't waaait for the next."
5,"5 ""you must read this"" stars. 
 Ok this book completely devastated me, I just experienced a book that I will never forget. This story will forever be burned into my mind, never to get lost in the many many books that I will read after this one. I laid in my bed last night thinking about this book and the characters, the story replaying in my mind. This was amazing, heartbreaking, difficult at times, funny sometimes, sweet and made me so mad at times I wanted to hurt someone and finally scream ""NO"" at my kindle!! 
 This was a double whammy book, what I mean by that is there are two stories being told here. One is about William Lyons, grad student, soon to be divorced, abused, closed up, uptight and a very sweet soul. William needs finish his dissertation, so he decides to be the caretaker of an abandoned insane asylum. He needs someplace to live that's quiet and figures this will be perfect. What he eventually finds hidden in a wall is a tin box filled with letters from a long time former patient ""Bill"". These letters Bill wrote to his lover, knowing he would never get to read them. Through these letters we get a glimpse into his life, his feelings, fears and the horrific way he was treated simply because he was gay. These letters were difficult to read and completely broke my heart. 
 Thank god there is light and laughter and sweetness in this book as well. William goes exploring into the tiny town near the asylum and finds Colby. Colby is a sweet, charming, flamboyant, friendly to everyone. When Colby meets William he completely gets in his business and wants to be his friend. Slowly as their friendship grows Williams opens up, loosens up and starts to gain self confidence and self acceptance. It was inspiring and uplifting to see William find happiness. 
 There was so much to this story, I can't begin to do it justice in my review. It devastated me, completely wrecked my heart, made me laugh, cry, sigh, swoon. In other words gave me exactly what i was looking for, a book that moved me, and found a permanent place in my heart."
5,Awesome. Epic.
4,"I am sort of confused about this one really. 
 I liked it very much for the most part but there were times when I wanted to hit Becca over the head with my book. 
 Chris could have been less of a dick and Michael more receptive. The twins were pretty fun. And I really liked Hunter, I knew there was something about him. And I can't wait to read his story. 
 All in all I had good vibes about it and I will sure check out the next in the series."
1,"The whole book Dannika kept telling me that the main character was independent, didn't need a man and could take care of herself. Yet time and time again she let a man save her, stand up for her and take care of her problems. Guess what? Your main character has the backbone of a wet cardboard box. 
 There were so many inconsistencies in the storyline I won't bother to list them all, but this book needs an editor and to not have every idea that might be ""exciting"" put into it. It made the character really shallow as she didn't seem to give a toss when half her family were missing, infact she was much more interested in chasing sausage. 
 Not worth paying for if you like your heroines realistic and spunky and your storylines engaging and well developed."
5,"Prepare your heart for this one is a heart-breaker! I cannot count how many times I said ""Ohmygod"" and ""what the f"" on this freakingly awesome book! I don't think I can't get over this one for Clare has delivered an amazingly written book. 
 I. NEED. THE. NEXT. BOOK. NOW!"
5,An enchanting tale for children. I was completely and thorougly annoyed by Rhun as I'm sure Lloyd Alexander meant the reader to be. I'm glad we got to see our good old friend Fflewddur Fflam but strangely I missed Doli!!
5,"This is a hard book to write a review for. Not because I didn't like it. No, I loved it. The characters are so well done down to the ones hanging out in the fringes. It's a complex, rich story that pulls you in and invades your brain and heart. Nastya, Josh, and even Drew have taken up residence and I just can't seem to shake them. Nor do I want to. Sea of Tranquility is probably the best contemporary YA (or is this NA?) I have read all year, if not in the past few years. There is so much that takes place between the pages that I want the reader to experience on their own for the first time. So without giving too much away, here I go... 
 Nastya is bitter and full of hate. So much so, that she's hard to like. At first. Yet as her story unravels in fragmented pieces, she gives away glimpses of her real self. And her real self is bitter and full of hate. But she's also vulnerable and strong, she's smart, caring, and silently screaming for salvation. I found myself wanting to reach into the pages to save her (or shake her, in equal parts). I wondered often throughout this book if someone could be so far lost that there was no hope for a second chance. Can Nastya move forward? Will she, if she finds her way out of the darkness she exists in? 
 Josh isn't perfect either. He's cold, distant, and would rather be left alone. And yet, I liked him almost instantly. He's blunt, honest, and steadfast. He's lost his family, and desperately protects himself from growing close to anyone that it would hurt to lose. He's created a force field around himself (Nastya describes it this way) to keep everyone out. But even Josh needs a refuge, and he finds that in his best friend Drew's family. And this seems to be enough until he discovers that it isn't. 
 Nastya and Josh form an unlikely friendship. Soon they develop a strong bond, and yet the threads that tie them together are delicate. They both seem to understand this and keep things light. But that can't go on forever. There are too many secrets between them. Too many buried issues that they don't seem in a hurry to fix. It's not surprising when things begin to fall apart. It is, after all, what they've both been waiting for. They make mistakes that can't be taken back. Say things that can't be forgotten. Discover things they wish they never knew. And just when things may be getting back on track, their world implodes. 
 This story is gripping and powerful in its telling. Unimaginable things take place, and Millay doesn't hold back. It's an achingly real tale that will wrench your heart out of your chest. And before you know what's happening, you've fallen in love with two seemingly unlikeable characters and are pleading with the heavens that they'll find themselves again. And hopefully they'll do it together.

5,"I cant even begin to describe this series. It was so original and completely action packed. It had EVERYTHING I look for in a paranormal book - demons, tough as nails chick who isn't afraid to stand up for what she believes in, a few super cute guys, and action. 
 I recommend this series to anyone who wants to stay up all night."
5,"OMG I loved this little novella. It kind of, a little bit, maybe, probably not, satisfied my need for Tahereh's words. 
 That girl has one heck of a way with words. 
 This novella is about Warner. His way of dealing with his injury and his own reflections into his feelings to Juliette. Warner finds her little journal that she kept while in the asylum, and reads it. Thoroughly. And it confuses him and enlightens him in ways he couldn't even dream about. 
 Warner also gets a proverbial slap in the face and acknowledges to himself that the outside world is suppressed in a way that is beyond unfair and cruel. 
 We get a glimpse into his humanity and his flaws. And also into his father's. And next to his father - Warner is a freakin' saint! 
 I'm beyond ready for Unravel Me. BEYOND!"
5,"OUTSTANDING is the word I would say to start with! 
 Total Fantasy, Of course YA Fantasy, excellent story, perfect characters fascinating plot. 
 Story is about a magician ""Kell"", a special one, with powers to move around different Londons which no ordinary man can do. Tell you honestly, first three parts of the book (book is divided in 14 parts) were all about introduction. I really felt bored with that however, after that story starts to build up and builds really spellbinding. He meets a cutthroat, a thief ""Lila"", Bold and Daring, on one of his adventurous nights and it turns out to be his partner for the most important fight which he intended to fight alone. 
 The Story revolves around basically how Kell tries to save his London (where he belongs) from cunning/ruthless/heartless/soulless the King and queen of another London who are keen on taking over Kell's London. He gives his heart, soul and body to save his world. 
 There are many mesmerising/spellbinding scenes which makes you feel you are watching a motion picture actually. All Fantasy lovers MUST MUST MUST read this ... Totally recommend! 
 Now lemme hop on to Book 2 :)"
5,"I can't even comprehend how much I adored this book. Not only was it absolutely perfect for a final installment to a trilogy, but I can also proudly state that The Death Cure by James Dashner is officially the 200th novel I've read in my lifetime. It's a happy, happy day."
3,"I think I'd give this one 3.5 only because I think the story has some flaws in it. Ethan, a kid from a small town in the South, falls in love with the new girl in town who appears normal at first, but then he finds out she's a caster. He ostracizes himself from basically everything and everyone he grew up with to be with Lena. They discover secrets about their ancestors, who had a past together, and secrets about their current families. It was interesting reading from Ethan's point of view. Usually you hear from the girl's perspective so this was a nice change. Boys aren't so emotional. 
 Ethan, it is shown and told to us, somehow has the power to protect Lena from the dangers that currently face her. However, at the end when it really came down to it, he did nothing to help. He doesn't even know he made it worse because Lena erased his memory. So I'm not sure why it was told to us the whole book he had to be with her to protect her, and then not actually protect her at the end. He does have some abilities of protection, though, and I am waiting for them to be explained. 
 Sure, the book was gripping when I was reading it and I had to find out what happened next, but when I wasn't reading it I was thinking how incoherent the storyline was. Since this is a series maybe Ethan will actually do something at the end of a few books? I haven't read the next book yet, but after Lena messed with Ethan's memory I can guarantee you Lena will be unhappy the whole next novel and Ethan will be down in the dumps not knowing how to cheer up his girlfriend because he doesn't remember what happened and can't guess what it could be. The plot better be worth the teenage angst! 
 I wish the story would have been as pretty and captivating as the cover, which I have been eying for quite awhile. 
 P.S. Wouldn't you just love to be able to communicate telepathically?"
2,"It felt to me like the kidnapping story was something thrown in as an afterthought. Most of the plot didn't really have to do with this big event in Oliver's life. 
 I was annoyed the most by the grammatical errors and the inconsistencies regarding time. For example, they go to a party in Emmy's van, but no mention is ever made of getting it back. They completely skipped over that. Not a big part in the grand scheme of things, but it is the little things like that that are the most annoying."
4,"Oh! Oh squeeee.... 
 *__* 
 Well, I guess Stephenie Meyers should just stick to writing single volume luuuuurve stories because her sequels really drag and show the flaws in her stories. But for one volume? Oh the angst and the triangles and woe are perfect! 
 I didn't give 5 stars because the main character was a crybaby doormat, lie-down-and-die kind of person/alien, but in the context of the story, I got over it. And she finds true love! *_* I knew I liked that guy better, hehehe. 
 Good stuff, the author has a way of writing that flows easily, quickly, and sounds natural. No doubt english/grammar freaks will fine-comb it and find all kinds of flaws, but for people who just care about how fast it makes them turn the pages, this is a great, enjoyable read. 
 * * * 
 ETA: This is perhaps not the best kind of book for re-reads, however. During my re-read, I thoroughly enjoyed it up until 3/4ths of the way in. After that...I had that kind of sickly feeling you get when you eat too much candy or junk food. :P It's fun and good, but only in moderate doses."
5,"Wow. What can I say? This book was tremendous. And Andy Weir is some kind of genius, which is what you need to be, I guess, to survive on Mars. Which pretty much means if I ever find myself on Mars ... yeah, I'm pretty much a goner. And check out the brain on Mark Watney. 
 The story is what makes this book so great, but the research behind it that generated an unmatched sense of realism (especially to a science ignoramus such as myself) is just unbelievable. A real masterpiece of sci-fi and literature. So compelling. And surprisingly funny. It's been a long time since I laughed out loud this much while reading a book. Seriously, if they do the movie right, it should be Best Picture material for sure. 
 The writing style is very unusual, though. It combines a first person narrative with a kind of third person omniscient pov, which I think is very hard to pull off. But in The Martian, it works. Props again to Andy Weir for being able to write like that. I'm jealous. 
 Definitely check out this book if you haven't already done so, even if Sci-Fi isn't usually a genre you read."
4,"I'm a fan of the Harry Potter series, let me say that at the outset. 
 Those perspicacious and persevering review police among you will note I changed my rating of HPDH from 5 to 4. 
 This happened after a dangerously near-death overdose of LOTR dvds, and subsequent (why-oh-why can I not accept the movie as it is without having to go back afterwards and bury myself in the book?!?!) bleary-eyed-and-blinking-through of how many squillion pages of Tolkien's prose, whereby I'm forced to admit: 
 there are too many similiarities between LOTR and HPDH (and to be honest, much of the whole of the HP series) for me to ignore any longer. 
 Gandalf flying from Saruman's Tower on the back of the eagle = Sirius flying from the Tower on the back of Buckbeak; 
 The ring (oh the weight of it) = the locket growing heavier and influencing its wearer; and 
 Gollum = Scabbers, Gandalf = Dumbledore, Frodo = Harry (they even look the same in the movies!). 
 I won't bore you with the rest, nor comparisons to the Le Morte d'Arthur. 
 But is HPDH still worth reading? Is it still entertaining? Will I return to immerse myself Harry's world? 
 You betcha."

 Hermione Upperton is a strong willed, independent woman who unfortunately lives in a time where she has little to no rights. She loves to race curricles, and she finally joined a driving club, The Lords of Anarchy. She is the only woman to have done so. Unfortunately, her gambling addicted father loses her horses the night before her first race. 
 Jasper, the Earl of Mainwaring, initially thought that Hermione's pursuits of race driving were a bad thing. His attitude changes though as he comes to know her. He watched helplessly as her father lost the horses at the gambling tables, and wished there was something he could do to help his friend. 
 The two end up getting tangled in a plot of horse thievery, gambling, and murder. No one seems safe throughout most of the book. I didn't realize this book was going to be part mystery, and I think too much of the meat of the story centered around that instead of around the growing relationship between Hermione and Jasper. 
 I did like the characters. We are given a little of Hermione's and Jasper's backstory, and their personalities stay strong and true through most of the book. The sense of danger did spice it up a little as well. Reading about the side characters has now gotten me interested in reading the other books in the series. 
 One pet peeve that this book poked at me with was the confusion with the title. It doesn't fit the book at all. I don't remember anything to give reason to the thought that Jasper went bad in any way. It's a catchy title but misleading. This is a small issue to have though with a book. I still recommend to anyone who loves historicals about strong independent women and mystery. Also, I would suggest reading the first book in the series prior to reading this one. The very beginning of how couple meets happens there, and so I missed out on that bit.

5,"omg. Soooo good. Way better than the first book. Oh and btw, if you're reading this, don't expect a proper review because I mostly rant because I like looking back on how I felt and what happened. 
 But of course, this will be a good rant because I gave it 5 stars :D 
 non-spoilery part: 
 1. Well first, let's acknowledge the fact that it took me a little more than three weeks to finish. Like omg, I just wanted to keep on reading the book because it was so good but school got in the way. Ugh. Why must I take such hard classes? 
 2. Anyways, the plot and writing was great. In the first book, I didn't really like her writing style because it was sometimes hard for me to understand or picture. But now that I've read the second book, I appreciate her writing style more. The more that I think about it, I wish I could write like her. The plot, well, I gave it a 5. Need I say more? 
 3. The beginning kinda annoyed me. It felt slow. It could be because I read the first book a few months back that I forgot some things. I also didn't understand why Mik and Zuzana would pop in from time to time but it later made a lot of sense. 
 4. You'd think there would be a lot of romance-y part because of what made the story but there wasn't a lot. Weirdly enough, I actually liked it that way. Plus, the new characters made up for it ;) 
 SPOILERY PART 
 PLEASE GO AWAY 
 PLEASE LEAVE 
 OR EVACUATE 
 IF YOU WISH TO NOT BE SPOILED 
 AGAIN, 
 SPOILERS AHEAD. 
 Alright. The ending. Omg the ending! It's kinda like a cliffhanger but it isn't really. I'm really satisfied with how the book ended. Damn you Jael for bringing angels to Earth. BUT HELL YES AKIVA WAS WILLING TO TEAM UP WITH KAROU. YES. 
 The email exchanges in the beginning between Zuzana and Karou was really funny. Especially the one where Zuzana thought Karou was dead. I about laughed my head off at how it was written. I was also surprised that Zuzana was able to locate Karou through that simple reply Karou answered with. Like, she could work for the FBI or some top secret agency. Oh and Mik, lol I ship him and Zuz so much. They're so adorable together! I just remembered the part when she was demanding Mik to pee in a water balloon to throw at Karou's ex. Hilarious! 
 The white wolf. Ugh. I hate him so much! First he kills Madrigal, and he tries to rape Karou! What the hell?! AND HE HAS THE DECENCY TO TELL KAROU THAT HE LOVED HER AS MADRIGAL. UGH. At first, when he and Karou started working together, I thought it was for the good. Apparently he was just using her. But I kinda got on to that soon. Ten. I don't know how to feel about Ten. Is she an enemy or an ally? 
 Ziri! Omg I love him so much! I loved how they were able to reconnect since at the beginning, they didn't really interact. Apparently it was because of that damn Wolf, Thaigo. I like how he was just a boy when Karou was Madrigal and those little reminiscing moments described when he was little and admired Madrigal. Also, omg. He has feelings for Karou! Why does everyone have feelings for Karou?! 
 When Thiago almost raped Karou and when she killed him I was pretty glad. But the next day when the White Wolf barges in, I was just like WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. But thank god it was just Ziri in a new form. Also, can we talk about Hazael? WHY DID MY BABY HAVE TO DIE?! Like, he was so funny and nice and perfect and why?! Why must he die?! 
 I feel like Karou and Akiva only met like twice in this book. The first time being when Akiva followed an injured Ziri back to their base and saw that Karou was alive and he gave her the thurible that contained Issa. I was so happy that Karou finally had a friend. It may not have been Brimstone himself but it was someone. But this meeting between Karou and Akiva was so heartbreaking. WHY CAN'T THEY JUST BE TOGETHER?! Oh, right, because they live in a fucked a world. 
 The second time they meet, Liraz and him had Hazael body with them. Asking Karou to heal him. It broke my heart to know that they were not able to salvage his soul so he was not saved :( My baby. 
 Btw, is it weird that I like how Akiva is jealous of Ziri and the ""Wolf""? Like when Karou healed Ziri and they slept beside each other, Akiva saw. And how Akiva noticed that she was always near the the Wolf (but it's Ziri). 
 Anyways, fantastic book! I can't wait to read the next."
4,"An interesting YA novel on the 2015 Carnegie shortlist. The opening section when Triss wakes up and starts to interact with her family and dolls is genuinely creepy. It is initially unclear whether the genre is a thriller or paranormal which helps to create tension. However, I did feel that the build up was overly long and could have been edited. The pace picks up significantly after Triss' visit to the cinema show and the novel settles into its chosen genre. Hardinge takes a fairly straightforward idea but develops it well. My only reservation (apart from the slow pace in the first third) is (view spoiler)[ that if you like thrillers you might feel cheated once the novel settles firmly into paranormal fantasy. (hide spoiler)]"
2,"What I Loved: Not much really and I think this totally has to do with me being a fan of the show. So this is one case where the show ruined the books for me. 
 What I Liked: In comparison to the first novel, I like that they have given you more of Damon and Stefan backstory. Matt is actually a very likable character in the books, so he is a bit of a joy to read. 
 What I don't like: I think L.J. Smith must have gone to a very small school with only shallow type of girls in it because most of the women in this book are annoying. I find myself not caring if anything bad happens to any of them....except Meredith (she appears to be a truly caring character). 
 Why it got a 2: Plain and simple--I enjoy the show 20 times more than I am enjoying the books. Will I finish the books--eventually since I do own them. These are not badly written and they are somewhat quick reads. I would say check them out if you are curious or better yet if you haven't seen the series. Otherwise, don't bother bumping them up on your TBR list, just read them when you get to them.

 Review: This might be one of those times it hurt me to see the show before reading the books. 
 What I loved: I didn't really love anything about this book. I did think it was a quick read and really well written though. 
 What I liked: I liked the amount of detail put into the scenery, something I think is missing from alot of book. I liked Stefan, Matt, Bonnie, and Meredith. I thought Caroline was sufficiently *itchy. 
 What I didn't like (still not warmed up too): Elena. I am sorry but at no point do I think she deserves to get the guy. She is shallow, self-serving, manipulative, and a little to much like Katherine from the show. All I kept thinking is Stefan and Matt have the worst taste in women. I might start to like her as the series progresses but right now I just don't like her character at all. Which could be a problem since she is the center of the series. 
 Overall I gave it a 3, there was enough good parts to outrank my dislike of Elena.

3,"This book is funny, yes. Kind of. There were a few times when I really had to restrain myself from laughing out loud. I really enjoyed reading the first parts, getting to know the characters and the story, but not much happens after that. And Gavin is cute but sometimes that little devil is a bit disturbing."
5,"Review first appeared on my blog: Book Addict 24-7 
 I received a copy from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review 
 Hannah Moskowitz's Marco Impossible is a middle grade novel that follows the adventures of young detectives Stephen and Marco during their last few days before their grade eight graduation. 
 The great ""heist"", as the two boys nickname it, begins with Marco's need to tell his crush, Benji, that he loves him. But as the time for the great revelation approaches, the boys are faced with complications, previously ignored issues in their friendship, and the difficulties of being a young gay boy. 
 Moskowitz's novel is an important read because it teaches its younger readers about self worth, standing up against bullies, the importance of honesty, the power of friendship, and how to be yourself. While Marco is definitely confident, it is what he does not admit to that makes his story all the more powerful. 
 Stephen is the narrator, but he places Marco on a pedestal, making the story feel more like a retelling of Marco's influence on Stephen's life. The narrative is consistent and reflects Stephen's afflicted emotions and passive exterior. His inner dialogue portrays a young man trying to not just understand his place in his best friend's life, but in his own world. 
 Marco Impossible is extremely well written. The prose is sharp, at times witty, and incredibly captivating. The character growth is realistic as characters face the hardships of growing up and accepting what comes to fruition. Moskowitz laces her storytelling with fun details like the detective notebook Stephen carries with him, or the mystery of a missing sock--for example. 
 But the heart of the novel is the bigotry found in this book for younger readers. The way that Moskowitz handles the abuse Marco and Stephen, by association, receive isn't as raw as in books for older audiences, but it is hinted at. The reader simply knows that the abuse is not okay because of how Moskowitz alludes to the events. The bullying, the lewd comments, and the physical abuse are not too intense that it would scar a child, but are powerful and very important as themes. 
 I was not expecting Marco Impossible to be so memorable. The premise sounded cutesy and like a light read. Be warned, this story is not a light read. Family and social issues sprinkle the pages, making Moskowitz novel a near in-depth analysis of young teenaged boys and their friendships and associations. 
 While Moskowitz explores adult concepts in Marco Impossible, she also retains the usual concerns that younger readers may experience. Her characters are learning to become who s/he is meant to be, what matters in life, and the hardships of first love. But most importantly, like many young readers, Moskowitz forces her characters to ask, ""What will happen now?"" once the adventures conclude and real life sets in, ""What will happen when I graduate and go to the next phase of my life?"" 
 I recommend Marco Impossible to readers of middle grade novels, and books that have meaningful messages intertwined with a seemingly light storyline. Romance, mystery, family, and friendship are all major players in Moskowitz's novel and if you're a fan of those genres, then you should definitely check this one out."
4,"I really liked the plot of this romantic suspense and the secondary romance was nice but sometimes the hero seemed a little too angry then the heroine a bit too stubborn, still overall a pretty good story. Kate's husband dies and she finds clues about her life before amnesia that lead her to widow Ryan."
2,"At the end of Spinelli's Stargirl, Stargirl moves away and we see Leo over the years without her in his life. Love, Stargirl supposedly picks up the narrative from Stargirl's perspective a month after she leaves Arizona and progresses from there. 
 This is one of those books that was clearly not meant to be written. Stargirl was a fully contained story. Over. Done. But it was really popular so I suppose Spinelli decided to write a sequel for the heck of it. There are a couple problems with that however. This book feels disconnected from the first and the only relation between the two I can see is the title. The events in Love, Stargirl seem to contradict the info in the last chapter of the first book. And the characters are completely different as well. Stargirl is NOTHING like the girl from the first book. She's more mundane, main-stream and just plain boring. There is NO story. It just drags on and on with a host of cardboard disingenuous characters that aren't enough to carry the story. WHY would Stargirl be obsessed with Perry, a boy who basically has a harem, is a kleptomaniac and a jerk. But oh no, she just can't get him out of her head. Ick. And Dootsie drives me completely insane. I have a five-year-old and Dootsie acts and talks more like a hyperactive three-year-old, she's not at all believable and rather annoying besides. On the whole I sincerely wish I'd stopped with the first Stargirl book, it was a thousand times better than its sequel."
4,"4 stars! 
 I liked this story. 
 I found this author's writing, characters, and story-line very similar to Kristen Ashley's early work (ROCK-CHICKS)."
2,"Personally, I've never seen the appeal of Jane Austen and her contemporaries. Her novels of manners in high society/minor aristocracy/landed gentry is as far from my kind of book as I think it's possible to get. If I wanted to read a novel set in this era I would at least want it to be about ordinary people, which is why Charles Dickens gets something of a pass from me. Comedies of manners like this one emphasize character over plot, and its the latter that would much rather read about. Not just any old plot, but something lively - with action, explosions, peril and ....zombies? Well, why not? 
 It's hard to tell is the author is a fan of the original novel or wanted to parody it, but certainly the whole idea of inserting zombies at strategic points in the story is an intriguing one. It starts off well enough, but as the story progresses the zombies become less and less interesting, which means that the original story takes front and centre. It's often an issue with zombies of course - once you've seen and dispatched one, you seen and dispatched all of them. It's something that series like The Walking Dead continually struggle with, and as a result the zombies end up as background to the more interesting dynamics between the living. As I wasn't particularly interested in the whole Bennett/Darcy story I became more and more bored as I went on. 
 One potentially interesting subplot was the conflict between Elizabeth Bennett and Darcy's aristocratic aunt Lady Catherine, re-imaged here as a deadly ninja assassin. Unfortunately the story goes nowhere because it is constrained by what happens in the original, which has her eventually come around to the relationship. I would have much preferred a few round of assassination attempts. 
 So in the end this book is an interesting failure, unless of course the author's intention was to get more people reading the original story, in which case it is a wonderful success."
5,"To put it simply, this is one of the best graphic novels I have ever read. 
 The main character, Jack Joseph, is an offshore oil rig worker responsible for scuba-diving and repairing the rig. On shore, his wife is pregnant with their unborn son and Jack feels the pressure of impending fatherhood. On one dive, Jack encounters a supernatural presence at the bottom of the sea that puts him in contact with the ghost of his own father. The story explores themes dealing with the relationship between father and sons and memory and reality. 
 This book is completely in black and white. All Jeff Lemire does is through the strokes,shades and layouts. And specially the double page spreads are mesmerizing. 
 The characters, heartfelt emotions, some amazing art pieces and a great storyline is what makes this book great."
5,"5 'Dash Wallace' stars 
 Look no further if you are in the mood for a fun, smart, witty, charming and sexy romance. HardBall had it all in spades. I know CD Reiss is famous for her kinks, but don't you even worry about the BDSM element because it was very minor and only being hinted at. I'm a little bummed that there isn't any whipping involve. Well, a girl can't has it all. 
 I'm sure everyone will loves the heroine, Vivian Foster right from the start. She feels so real and relatable. A grade school librarian who loves her underprivileged kids and everything baseball. Recently got dump by her loser boyfriend, she was having a little self esteem issue, but that didn't deter her from putting her best foot forward. 
 I was a public school librarian with a reading habit, and he was a mysterious and gorgeous athlete with the grace of the wind. Our paths had no reason to cross. 
 Dash Wallace is the star baseball player. He is perfection from the outside, and from the inside, he is quite a mysterious guy. The one who keep his personal life away from the limelight. I'm not one to swoon over any good looking guy on page, but Dash really did make me weak on my knees, whenever he quoted Shakespeare. 
 ""Grace on my lips, and if those hills be dry, stray lower where the pleasant fountains lie."" 
 Their interaction was the main highlight of the book for me. Their texting and flirty banter is turning me into a giggling school girl. Or maybe is every girl fantasy to capture the attention of a famous jock and the said jock actually turns out to be a total geek like you. What are the chances? 
 ""Were you feeling all right?"" 
 ""No, not at all."" 
 ""Bellyache?"" 
 ""Yeah, a two-month bellyache called Vivian-itis. Symptoms include desperate longing and inability to do anything but feel like a douchebag. Patient can't do shit on the field but stand there like an ass, wondering what the fuck he's doing with his life. It's chronic. No known cure."" 
 There are a lot of references towards baseball, which left me feeling puzzle. I don't watch baseball. Give me English football anytime, and I will know all the technical terms. Anyway, not knowing what the heck they are talking about didn't deter my overall enjoyment of the story. 
 About the main crisis in the book, is all about superstition. I can't believe baseball player or more accurately Dash Wallace is such a superstitious man. I thought we Asians are hardcore, he is worst. Omg! He had so much routine and tradition that he needs to stick with in order to win. Poor Vivian is torn between feeling flattered and burdened to be his lucky star. 
 ""Be my ever-fixed mark. Be my north star."" 
 I find the dilemma faced by Dash towards the end was pretty fitting. Before it all went down, I'm a little worried about his stubbornness and strictness towards his game plan. I'm also worried for Vivian, whether is she being too compromising for the man she loves. So a great applause for CD Reiss for making the ending such a perfection. This is the kind of book I don't mind rereading again and again. 
 I was a small man in a big world I didn't understand. A fool and a fraud. A gambler whose luck had run out. I was a meaningless ball of thoughts and fears with no control over the way my life unfurled. But with her, I wasn't afraid."
5,"This book. I hadn't cried over a book about World War II in some time. After a while, I guess you just grow numb to all the horrors. But this book made it come alive for me again. 
 The Nightingale allows us a look into the lives of the French Resistance--specifically the women. They are often the forgotten backbone of the story. 
 Read and remember."
5,"I've heard a lot of great things about this book and was psyched to find out that it absolutely lived up to all the hype. 
 The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer starts off with our protagonist, Mara Dyer, waking up in a hospital bed and being told her two friends, and her boyfriend, are dead. They were in an abandoned building when it collapsed, subsequently killing her friends and leaving her- for the most part- unscathed. To make matters worse she had absolutely no memory of what actually happened that night. 
 In an attempt to get away from the town her friends died in; her family packs up and moves themselves from Rhode Island to Miami, Florida. This is where our story really begins as Mara meets a boy named Noah Shaw and periodically gets pieces of her memory back from the night that her friends died. And she begins to find out that there may be more to her friend's deaths than a building collapsing due to old age. 
 Writing:: I'm not sure why, but I felt something oddly comforting about the writing in this book. I know this comment may get certain people upset, but something about it reminded me of Twilight, but in the best possible way. Don't get me wrong, I love Twilight, but we all know there is a sort of stigma attached to the book. Anyway, what reminded me of it was that I got a feeling reading this that I haven't gotten since the first time I read Twilight. The feel of the book and the utmost desire to know what exactly was going on with our male lead. I could contribute this to the plot, but it wasn't the plot, that was nothing like Twilight, It was the feeling I got while reading it which is something that, try as I might, I can't explain to a person. So yes, this comparison is a very positive thing coming from me. In fact it's probably the biggest compliment I can give a book; it's that feeling man... 
 Plot:: The plot of this book is another thing I adored about it. I can say without a second thought that I have never read a story like this before, which is more than I can say for a lot of YA books which seem to have a lot of plot points in common. Let's hope Noah doesn't leave in the next book so this originality can stick through out the rest of the story. The one negative thing I can say, probably about the whole book, is that I did get confused at times. There were moments when I wasn't sure if what was happening was real or a dream, and other times when I was just completely lost with what was going on. It affected the way I read it when I was thinking she was dreaming and it turns out she really wasn't; it tends to take on a much more... trippy... atmosphere in my head when a character is dreaming. This also could have been contributed to the fact that when I'm really into a book I tend to read faster because I want to know what's going to happen. 
 Romance:: I LOVE the romance in this book. Through out some of the book I was a little hesitant to like it because it seemed like the typical situation where some guy who hardly dates, or is a huge player, takes a interest in this new girl for absolutely no good reason. In this instance, you find out in the end why he developed such an interest in Mara and it makes sense. This actually leads me into my next topic of discussion... 
 Characters:: Mara was actually a female protagonist who I didn't want to kick in the face. *claps for Michelle Hodkins* This led to me understanding for once what this extremely sexy guy saw in her. She was to me the quintessence of what a female protagonist should be; she had the perfect mixture of qualities. She was independent and didn't need help constantly from Noah- though she took it when he offered; she actually tried to deal with life on her own. She didn't constantly obsess over her looks, in fact they were hardly discussed, and she kept the number of unnecessary stupid acts to a minimum, and fell once without feeling the need to talk about how clumsy she is for the rest of the book. 
 Noah.... He was British. That makes Kayla smile so she feels she doesn't need to say much more on the subject. Okay, well maybe he was suffering from a bit of perfect boy syndrome but that doesn't bother me like it bothers some people. The unnecessary display of his wealth was a bit annoying, and the speaking multiple languages, but that was made up for by the fact that he was a bad boy with a heart of gold. I loved all the other characters too. Her brothers, her dad, her mother annoyed me a bit sometimes but that probably comes down to the fact that I'm a teenage girl and can't really the side of a concerned mom. Hated the mean girl character, I honestly can't remember her name for the life of me, and her little friend- but you weren't supposed to like them so there you go. Loved Jamie, all the characters were just so amazing and I wanted to hug them all. Oh and I love the name Jude so that was a high point for me. 
 Ending: What?!? Only word to describe my reaction to the ending of this book, I may have actually yelled it out while reading it. I'm not going to spoil anything, but let's just say, a whole other can of worms is opened up within the last few pages of this book. And it will have you cursing the world that the sequel isn't already out. 
 In conclusion, I think it's blatantly obvious how I felt about this book. It was freaking amazing. I love that it some how managed to be a paranormalish romance that also brought up some very serious moral issues. Spoiler:: Like for instance, is there a difference between killing someone while not actually knowing your doing it or making a conscience decision to do so? ::End spoiler:: This book was surprisingly very dark, especially for the genre, it definitely had it's more serious parts. I can't wait for the second book, and suggest that right after you finish reading this you go out and buy yourself a copy of this book.

5,"It's not very often that I add a title to my list of favorite books, and I've never felt the burning desire to create a shelf for my favorite reads on Goodreads - that is, until this moment. After finishing up with Mindy Mejia's Everything You Want Me to Be, I am nearly speechless. What Mejia has pulled off in her book is nothing short of a impressive. 
 One of the things that caught my interest when I was browsing through titles to request on NetGalley was the synopsis for this novel, which I found to be unique. Most books give you a loose summary of the plot, sans spoilers. It's the information that you usually find on the back of a book, really. That little tidbit of information for Everything You Want Me to Be came defied the norm in that regard by blatantly telling potential readers that they would be following the life of a girl up until her death which, if you ask me, is a pretty big spoiler: one that leaves a challenge at that. If you tell your readers that the main character is dead, the question that remains is this: how are you going to keep them hooked? Mejia's reply to that query comes in the form of a plot full of nerve-wracking twists and turns that, no matter how certain a reader might be, is likely to still leave them searching for answers. (I was actually guessing until the very end how this book would play out, and I did not figure it out until the very last moment, when there were only lines left until the major reveal.) 
 Everything You Want Me to Be is a whodunnit novel - of that, I have no doubt. Eighteen-year-old Henrietta Hoffman, full of talent and with her whole life ahead of her, is murdered. It was someone close to her, according to evidence, and its left to the sheriff, who happens to be the girl's father's best friend, to find out who's behind it. It is also a psychological thriller. Reading this book, I felt things I did not want to feel. Where I felt I should be directing anger and disgust, I could not; in fact, my least favorite character is actually the victim, rather than the various suspects I encountered as I read. 
 Henrietta, or Hattie as she prefers to be called, is a typical teen-aged girl, facing the usual obstacles of small town life. Having been in her shoes, I was able to connect with her and, in some ways, relive my own past as I read through her dialogue. Born and raised in rural south Minnesota, Hattie has dreams of the Big Apple. Every moment of her free time is spent focusing on those dreams, and while she's browsing through a forum, she meets a guy that she ends up falling in love with. Through private messages, a relationship blooms, and she and this guy embark upon a journey with an unknown destination. It's a pretty easy web to get caught up in, especially when one spends most of their time pleasing other people, which Hattie obviously does. 
 The book is told from three perspectives in total: Henrietta's, Peter's, and Del's. Peter is a teacher at her school and Del is the town's sheriff. In addition to these three vastly different points-of-view, there is a plethora of minor characters and, surprisingly enough, they all have their own quirks and flaws. I have to admit I'm actually impressed by how much depth there is to Mejia's characters and that she's written them in such a way that it's easy to remember their traits. More often than not, when there's so many characters to flesh out, it is way too easy to lose track of individual character traits. 
 I can't say a whole lot about the plot's flow really. To be honest, it is a bit all over the place. Considering that Everything You Want Me to Be is written in a loose journal-style and one of the speakers is the sheriff, that is to be expected. Obviously there isn't much of a need to include him prior to the discovery of Hattie's body. Also, the story starts at the end, then hooks back to a year prior to the murder. Fortunately, each shift in voice is dated, so it's not too much of a challenge to keep up with. 
 Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for providing me with an advance copy for the purpose of an unbiased review. I can't wait for a chance to purchase a physical copy of this book for my shelf!"
3,"I guess you'd call this a companion book to the Doctor Who episode ""The Angels Take Manhattan"". It is not THE book that features in the episode (which is really disappointing) but it's still a fun bit of fluff, with a few bits of yowza."
5,This book is amazing!!! Cant wait for the movie!!
5,"4.5 stars 
 This book may have very well saved my book-brain's life. I was in rut, stuck trudging through a book with no end in sight. I've got worlds to discover, people's lives to live, and love to conquer. My brain, she needed a re-boot (please excuse the speaking about body parts as separate entities - I'm reading Darynda Jones at the moment and the book spilleth over into life). I picked up some other books and two other genres didn't fix my rut. Drastic measures were needed. 
 Those drastic measures were a brand-new-to-me author, a book of so few pages I knew it would be subdued in no time, the safety of a favorite genre, and going for the jugular, I chose a book with a storyline I would love. Boo-ya! Brain, she is a humming along once again. How'd it happen? 
 First, new adult romances are happy candy for me but Charlie and Jonah's story isn't just the cheap, grocery store milk chocolate kind of story (there's lots of it but it's not that great of quality). Their story was more like a truffle from the Godiva counter. Small but oh, so good for that short time. 
 Charlie and Jonah had actually dated when Jonah was just finishing up his senior year in college. When he graduated, he took off without so much as a goodbye to Charlie. This crushed Charlie and for years she always thought of Jonah as ""the one that got away"". And she can't really escape his memory because he taught her everything about hacking and gaming. 
 So it's only a small surprise Charlie runs into him at the Hackfest she's entered. Jonah's intent on apologizing to Charlie for how he left. Charlie is intent on avoiding Jonah and concentrating on her future by winning Hackfest. 
 Jonah has made mistakes in the past with Charlie but he continues to make even more at Hackfest. I think that made him more human, fallible, and ultimately humbly in love with Charlie at the end of the book. All that endeared him to me even more. He was just too adorable not to forgive. I will spill that I thought his reason for running after graduation was kind of weak but I get his point of view. 
 Charlie was awesome in her own way. She was a balanced character who was a homebody geek (happier staying in than going out partying), super whip smart, but she was also polished and slick enough to sell herself to company recruiters. And she had no qualms about standing up for the rights of others. 
 But back to my list of how this book saved my life... with this story being as short as it was, I was able to sit and read it in one sitting. That's it! I was in and out and no one got hurt. I literally read this story in bed one night. Granted, I was up until 3:30am but that's just a testament to the story's appeal. 
 Thirdly, the story appealed to me because I'm a wanna-be gamer. My hubs plays first person and RPGs for hours at a time. I try and play my son's games and just don't own a cell of coordination in my body. I could not work a controller if my life depended on it. It's very sad. But the world intrigues me, especially all the Cons and everything else related. 
 And because I'm such a wanna-be geek over gamers, I stayed up until 3:30am to live in a romantic world where the geeks got their HEA. And I successfully got my book-brain's mind wipe *drool*... side effects may vary. 
 Review appears on"
5,I swear these books are addicting. Moving into the next one...LOL
3,"This is my least favorite Jane Austen, although it's the one my college professors seemed to love the most."
5,"I adored this book; I can't recommend it enough. At the Water's Edge takes place in Scotland during WW2, but it's themes are timeless. The beauty of love and friendship is contrasted with the horrors of war and the destructive power of selfishness. Add a bit of Gaelic superstition and you have a story you cannot put down."
4,"I am exhausted. Totally exhausted. 
 I can't believe I only started this book two hours ago? I feel like I'm been reading for days! 
 I really liked this one, though I missed the mystery element since I figured out the big plot twist very quickly. The way the author wrote Annie's voice was fascinating! Even I was getting confused about certain things- whether or not she was just hearing people call her Nanny etc. 
 The descent into Annie's breakdown was perfectly done. It was just disjointed and crazy enough to be realistic, which later makes a lot of sense (view spoiler)[ as we find out it was orchestrated by Libby. (hide spoiler)] 
 I really enjoyed Annie as a character, and really felt for her as things started going downhill. I also loved Owen- I particularly enjoyed that the author didn't make this a romance novel. Don't get me wrong, I love a good romance, but it was nice to have a mystery/thriller novel with just a little romance on the site. Owen still played a vital part in the story, but without it coming across like the Romance was the most important element. 
 Zoe, in my opinion, was by far the best character in the novel. The author simultaneously captured the voice of a three-year-old and the voice of a child in an uncomfortable situation. I felt that Walker and Libby - like most adults when it comes to kids- very much underestimate how perceptive Zoe was. I think she had an inkling (view spoiler)[ that something wasn't right with Libby all along, and was in fact scared of her. (hide spoiler)] 
 As a mystery novel, this one falls slightly short. If you're looking for a big plot twist, didn't-see-it-coming kind of book then this one probably isn't for you. As a thriller, though, The Ruining is absolutely one of the best I've read this year."
3,"3.5 stars, but I just couldn't give it 4 when it hasn't weathered well in my memory. See the addendum at the bottom for thoughts on why. 
 --- 
 i reread 'the name of the wind' last week in preparation for sitting down to read this book, and realized as i did so that i hadn't really retained much of it. but this time, after getting through the obligatory three silences nonsense, i found myself completely enthralled. these two books have everything i loved about 'a wizard of earthsea', but it's not just a story of ""yay i'm going to school to be a wizard"". there's a bit of the atmosphere of 'the prestige' in there, a bit of arthurian legend, a bit of a dozen other fantasy stories i've loved that mix to make a really fun reading experience. but for all that there's a strange quality to the book that has only become clear to me after two days of thinking about it. 
 in a lot of fantasy series you get a sense early on of who's an important character to latch onto, and who isn't. who's going to stick around, and who's just an anecdotal character. in this series (so far, at least) almost no one besides kvothe feels like a central character (except for denna, obviously, but her mystery is a whole separate thing for me). wil, simmon, fela and the others at the university are interesting and fun, and i enjoy their presence in the books, but i don't have a sense of where or how they fit into the larger story. same with the maer and the mercenaries and the adem that kvothe meets on his travels. how important are they? should i get attached or not? are they still a part of kvothe's life, or even still alive, in the later timeline? 
 because the thing is, with these books there's the knowledge hanging over my head the entire time that Bad Shit is going to go down, and a lot of it. not only does kvothe still have to get booted from the university and presumably kill the king, but he is nowhere even close to hunting down the chandrian. there seems to be a great gulf between the kvothe telling this story, and the kvothe he's telling the story about. who the hell is denna and who is her patron? where does bast enter into the story and what the heck is he up to now? furthermore, i get the strong sense that when kvothe's done telling his history to chronicler there's a bit of asskicking still to be done, and where is that going to fit? and while i don't doubt that rothfuss has a lot of plot devices still up his sleeve, it's hard to believe he's going to be able to wrap this all up in one more book. 
 aside from all that, though, i honestly could not put this book down. and while its end left me troubled and feeling disjointed and a bit overwhelmed with all the pieces of story thrown at me, and completely at a loss as to how they might fit together, i was sad to finish it. the writing is good, and the story is intriguing and the parts flow smoothly from one part to the next. 
 Addendum: 
 On rereading, I have to say there's more that bugs me about both of these books that I think I was too caught up in the story to notice the first time through. The plot holes-- all the questions I asked in the second-to-last paragraph-- are much more jarringly noticeable, and the degree to which Kvothe is the typical man's man archetypal hero gets a bit eye-rolly after two books of it. 
 Maybe it's just that (perhaps an unfair comparison, but one I'm going to make anyway) on the heels of The Republic of Thieves, this sort of high fantasy that fits the tropes instead of subverting them feels rote and expected. There's something to be said for the fact that as I discovered with my reread of TNOTW, with two years' distance between now and the last time I read the book, I *still* didn't remember a whole lot about it. Some scenes stuck out, some plot threads, but the bits that are the most interesting are still the bits with current-day Kvothe, Chronicler and Bast. The rest is just a bit too David Copperfield to make it into the top of my heap. 
 I'll still read the third one when it comes out, of course, and I'm sure it'll make great TV when the show finally gets off the ground. But thus far the books haven't weathered the test of time as well as I'd have wished they would."
2,"I hate to say this as I was so looking forward to this book but I really didn't like it. I found Isla and Josh so irritating. They fell in love too quickly and were too obsessed with each other. I found Isla to be really unlikable especially compared to Anna and Josh was not as charming as I expected him to be after meeting him in Anna and the French Kiss. I'm not going to say anything more about it as I really do love the author and her other books. The only positives I can give are that the first meeting between Josh and Isla was hilarious when she was high on drugs, Kurt was adorable and I absolutely loved getting to see past characters again."
4,I love that the overall plot finally moved a bit and this books is pretty cool as well (with some unnecessary deaths). They are still the same standard as the rest of the books and I loved it.

 Sarah Ockler is one of my all-time favorite authors, with just her first novel, she won me over, so I was supper exited to read Fixing Delilah, and it didn't disappoint. 
 Fixing Delilah centers more on family relations, the responsibilities, troubles and joys that come with it, sometimes even secrets. The story follows Delilah Hannaford's summer, and all the things she goes through: Love, Friendship, Family, Self-Discovery, and finding someone you thought you'd lost forever. 
 Delilah Hannaford was a character that I deeply enjoyed. I loved the way she changed through the course of the book. How everything between her family, relationships, and herself, get completely tangled up, and there seems to be no way out. No way to get rid of all those ties and knots that are making her life so complicated. To a point where she is so broken, so lost, that everything just, collapses; and she ruins her relationships and it seems that herself too. But Delilah, being a strong and beautiful character, grows, learns, and gets herself ""fixed"".

 Every character was just beautiful in this story, and specially Patrick who's just....just... *sigh*, yeah, he's just that . The scenario of the town, Luna's coffee shop in which I'd LOVE to spend my summer, reading, drinking delicious chocolate hazelnut lattes... and hear Patrick sing... *sigh*... 
 What I learned from Fixing Delilah: Some question can't or simply don't have a logic answer, and that's ok. You'll screw up, BIG TIME, and you just have to learn, not to not screw-up, but to always get up. That you make terrible mistakes, mistakes that there's no coming back from, but you would never change a thing, because what you've got, its worth it 100%. That family is complicated, but its all you've got. Friends are everywhere, you just need to look closely, and love always finds you, no matter how hard you hide. Oh! And, that we are not elephants (you'll know what I mean ^^). 
 Even though Twenty Boy Summer keeps being my all-time favorite, Fixing Delilah got its room in my heart, a delightful summer novel, characters that became my family, and an incredible journey fixing Delilah. Fixing Delilah is a must-read summer book. Actually, it's a must-read anytime. Any Sarah Ockler book is a must-read anytime actually xD!

3,"3.5 STARS 
 Ooookay, this is disappointing. 
 First, the book is not written like a book. It was more like a script. There are no descriptive paragraph describing the characters' feeling, what they're doing. The book contained conversations. Exactly what a script is. 
 I honestly expect more from this book, I want more. 
 This story revolves around Albus and Scorpio and time travel. This is a story about Albus who wants to prove worthy of his father, thus almost destroy the world. 
 As in love as I was with the previous series, I can't say I'm in love with this book. It lacks of adventure. 
 //SPOILER SECTION// 
 The book started with Albus's first year, as shown in the seventh book's epilogue, Albus was nervous about getting sort to Slytherin. Though, it was true he did get into Slytherin (I was so happy, because finally, something new. He befriended Scorpio Malfoy and together they were kind of the losers in the school. Because well, Albus is Harry Potter's son who got in Slytherin and Scorpio, there are ridiculous rumor that he was Voldermort's son. 
 Then one day when Albus overheard Harry's and Amos Diggory's conversation about how Amos heard about time-turner and wanting the Ministry to go back in time to save Cedric, Albus decided to go on adventure with Scorpio to save Cedric. This resulted with a lot of destruction for time. World nearly got destroyed, Voldermort ruled, etc. 
 Anyway, Harry showed up and saved the world. Again. 
 Honestly, I have to say this again, I expected something more. I wanted to know how all the characters doing. I desperately wanted to know about George Weasley, because he and Fred are my favorite character all the time and there were no mention about George at all. 
 Like I said, the story is told narrowly. 
 Additional point, I love the reconciliation between Harry and Draco <33 
 But I have no doubt that the story will be amazing on movies. I only wish that it was nor written in a script form. 
 Overall, I was not satisfied about the book, because it only gives us a little peek of Harry Potter's life and none of other."
5,"Much like the first book, Undeniable, I devoured this! It was so good. So much drama, and it is written so beautifully! 5 stars!!"
5,"Sanderson wrote A Memory of Light and The Bands of Mourning at the same time and Wayne's character is along the lines of Mat from Wheel of Time (Especially A Memory of Light), I loved both characters."
3,"I read this book because I was already two books into the trilogy and really had to find out what happened. And there is a really good and exciting plot buried under all the unnecessary pages. Had this book been 400 or even 500 pages long, it would have been fine. But there was so much extra verbiage and whining, especially, on the part of the main character that there were moments (the entire last two thirds of the book, for example), when I was just shouting at the book to get on with it. 
 But at least finishing the series was satisfying."
2,"Um. This reads like Twilight fanfiction. I even googled to see if was originally Twilight fanfiction. It doesn't appear to be, but ... yeah. Not good."
4,Matty. I love you. But I love Julie's POV a bit more.
4,"Although I could see where it was headed, the black-out ride to get there was a fun journey!"
2,"Actual rating: maybe 2.5 
 Well... that was disappointing. Really wanted to love this one, especially with a gorgeous cover, but I just couldn't. 
 It took me ages to get through just the first half alone, due to cardboard characters, predictable dialogue, and just an obvious sense of where the plot was going. Luckily, it picked up a bit more in the second half but by then I just waiting to see if it would be any better. 
 Lukewarm feelings overall."
5,"""Did you ever have a night that just...seemed to change everything?"" he asked, ""And everything is different afterward?"" 
 Wow. I mean just. wow. This book was so heart-wrenching. I mean like pulls-at--you so hard, you wish the pain would stop and just end already. I mean, at least that's how I felt. 
 Second Chance Summer follows a seventeen year-old girl, Taylor Edwards. Her family is to spend the summer together at their old lake house in Pocono Mountains, a place she hasn't been in for five years now. And the thing is, the last time she was there, she left a messy mess with two of her closest friends. She's back now, and a lot has changed. Yet, some things are still the same. 
 This story is exactly as the title implies. It's a story of believing you can change things, do things better if you're given another chance. It's a story of embracing your fears and learning how to overcome them. I thought Taylor was somewhat of a coward. Her solutions to her problems were to run away. Literally. She would just run away from her home when things got bad, choosing to not confront them because she couldn't handle it. This summer gives her the chance to learn how to stay put, to stand up in the face of fear. I loved reading about how she grew into a stronger girl, how she understood what it meant to not run away. During the summer, she's met up again with Lucy and Henry. I was rooting for Taylor to finally confront them both, and give them the explanation they both deserve. I loved reading about how their relationships progressed throughout the book. It was honest, toughing, and very hopeful. Taylor's family is a very crucial part of the book. You seriously cannot help but love them. I learned to love them like they were my own family. They are disfunctonal, yes, but they still stick together through the rough times, the toughest of times. Taylor says that she and her family had never been close, but this summer, we get to see her mend the rift between her and her family; we get to see her form a relationship she's always wanted, a relationship she wishes she could have had years ago. 
 The romance was slow to develop, but don't worry, because it is there. It was one of those that slowly creeps into your heart, that makes you yearn for one of your own. Henry was such a romantic guy. I could just see his smile, hear his voice. I felt like I was Taylor, and that it was me Henry was laughing with, kissing, talking with, sharing his secrets with. I was upset at the times that Taylor hurt him, but I sympathized with Taylor too much to really hate her for it. And boy, I got just as jealous as Taylor did when she thought of Henry with another girl, when she saw him with another girl. It seriously punched me in the gut, and we were both left to wonder if Henry felt the same way as we did. Or, for Taylor, not me. Henry doesn't even know me. Haha, he's nor even real...so, anyways. He's swoon worthy. 
 I closed my eyes and, as the rain and wind whipped all around us, he kissed me. 
 The crying part. You should know, the last forty pages or so, I was bawling. Not crazy bawling, but bawling enough to make the pages in front of me extremely blurry. Taylor goes through something that no one ever wants to go through. What happened, I felt as if it were happening to me. And that is what made me cry. Because it felt so real. It felt like I was there in the room with her, that I had to endure this pain, come to terms with the fact that what was happening, I had no control over. That it was going to happen no matter what. And I'm starting to cry all over again just thinking about it. It's so heart wrenching. And I understand that I've already read books where situations like these have happened, but in this book, we get to experience the whole thing like it's really happening to us. I might sound a little cryptic, but you'll have to read this book to see what I mean. 
 I finally got what Dickens was talking about. It was the best of times and the worst of times, all mixed into one. 
 So, I am recommending this book to any summer lovers, to people who believe in second chances. And if you're looking for a light summer romance read, this isn't the one. This is a story of a girl who grows up in one summer into a person she can believe in. There is grief and loss, but there is hope and love. I laughed quite a lot, in this book, actually. It brought tears of joy and sadness to my eyes, and any book that does that to me is special. I loved this book, and hope whoever else reads it is just as impacted by it as I was. Morgan Matson is officially a favorite author. I just can't believe I haven't read Amy and Roger's Epic Detour yet."

 God I love his name.<3 God I love this book. I loved everything about it Perkins has an extraordinary talent for totally hooking readers in.Her characters are lovable and very very believable. They have feelings and do stupid things and it makes you love them that much more when they do cutesy things. 
 I found myself falling in love with their relationship...... then dying all the way till the end. 
 Im currently trying to convince my parents to fly me to Paris so I can sip hot chocolate so thick its practically syrup, visiting Pere Lachaise Cemetery and Kilometer Zero, Notre Dame,and the Eiffel tower. 
 Perkins paints that lush vibrant green and magical quality of spring in Parisink it's all I ever think bout now. 
 I cant wait to share that experience in the city of lights, I hear there much more forgiving of Canadians <3"
4,"February 25- Holy Hannah, this book was a wild experience. I can't even decide if I want to mark it as ""favorite"" or not. It was certainly thought-provoking but it left me with an uncomfortable amount of questions. Firstly, the fate of the MC. Where did she go? Did she kill herself? Was she murdered? Did she have a baby? Did she ever see Luke or her daughter again? These wonderings are haunting me but I don't know if I could reasonably demand answers, since this reads like a diary and obviously nobody puts all the answers in their diaries. Still, I would like to feel some sort of personal closure. I liked that the end of the book had a bit of an explanation of what happened leading up to Gilead and the timeline of it all, but I still want to know how the MC turned out and how she recorded the tapes and how she escaped (if at all). ;____; *TELL ME.gif*"
3,"This book nicely weaves the present timeline and the story of the Salem witch trials together. Only one thing got on my nerves with this book: Connie, as a talented and well-read graduate student, ought to be a lot smarter than she is. I'm no colonial history nut, but if I'm catching on to things chapters before Connie does, that makes me worry what kind of history professors Harvard's churning out these days. In some places Connie made me wish for Robert Langdon of DaVinci Code fame, because whatever else Langdon is, at least he's a smart character who figures things out. Connie needed several sharp smacks in the head at times. Overall, though, a solid first book, a good historical novel, and a fun read."
5,"When I was in tenth grade, my English teacher set us an Essay Assignment one semester: It is the year 2100. You are exactly the same age you are today. Explain with detail and examples, a typical day in your life. (Something along those lines.) 
 I had forgotten all about this assignment up until I had started reading Ready Player One. But as I got further and further into this book, it started to come back to me. This is pretty much what I had predicted. (Although, Ernest Cline definitely wrote it better than I did!) Either way, this book struck a chord with me for sure. Not only have I decided to give it five stars, but also, I have placed it on my favourites shelf, something I haven't done for a book in a few years, I think, unless your name is JK Rowling or Robert Galbraith! 
 Ready Player One takes place in the year 2044. When you stop to think about that, that is actually not that far away; we will all probably be alive when it comes around. And that is a truly freaky thought, if we are going to go by what Cline has laid out for us, on our beautiful blue planet; we are running our of space, out of food and out of resources. It would be a far stretch to continue to call this our ""Blue Planet."" 
 That is why children and adults choose to live their lives mostly in the OASIS. A virtual reality game where you can be anyone you want, do anything you want, build what ever you want. You can base or even recreate your favourite movies, TV shows, books, etc. (Indeed, I've already spent more hours than I care to admit imagining my what my avatar would look like, and where I'd be - Planet Hogwarts and BFFs with Harry Potter, duh!!!) 
 We follow the life of Wade Watts a high school student who, like almost every other OASIS user, has dedicated his life to finding The Egg. 
 OASIS' creator was a bit of a shut in himself. Meaning no heirs. When he discovered that he was dying he set up the biggest treasure hunt in virtual reality. The winner who finds the three keys and completes all the quests, and gets to the egg first, wins it all. The entire OASIS program, and the billions that go along with it. 
 The creator, James Halliday, grew up in the 1980's. He was a nerd to the nth degree. So he based this massive hunt after all of his favourite movies, games and TV shows from that era. An entire generation in the future, furiously studying everything that happened back then. Not only studying, but enjoying and obsessing over. Countless times you hear Wade geek out about the show Family Ties, or the movie WarGames. I think it goes to show what kind of faith Cline has in the creativity of our future, if everyone is going to go back to the 70's and 80's and thoroughly enjoy what they had to offer, even with crude special effects and the like. 
 Its not just fellow gunters (egg hunters) who are vying for this specially prize. OASIS' top competitor, Innovated Online Industries (IOI) were also competing for this takeover, by whatever means necessary; stealing, cheating, even murder. (And not just in the game, either.) It is an all consuming competition. 
 There are some truly chilling parts to this book. Mostly about how most humans shun their physical lives altogether. Living in little boxes big enough to hold their gaming consoles and themselves. No real physical activity, no direct sunlight. (Wade goes six months without stepping out of his flat at one point.) No real contact with actual people. (That being said, as I contemplate this awful turn of humanity, as I myself try to do everything one handed, cook, eat, walk my dog, the other hand shoving this book in my face) We don't really have that far to go to get to that point, do we? 
 I loved everything about this book, though. The references are a great reward for everyone. I missed the 80's but grew up in the early 90's, so I'm pretty sure I got most of the references. I definitely created a list of things I want to check out though. And Cline referenced FIREFLY twice so I freaking love this guy. 
 I think it also goes to show the level of writing Cline is at; there are very few conversations in this book. A lot of it is world building, contexts and description. For the most part, I find that very difficult to read, but in this case, major exception! There was no real part of this book that felt like it was dragging for me. No way. I am just sorry that it wasn't a longer book! 
 Recommending this to absolutely everyone. Such a fantastic read! Slightly ashamed I've never hear of it until now, as this book has been out since 2011 I believe. Everyone needs to read it! 
 GAME OVER."
5,"Update: As of my re-read in October 2016, I still stand by my initial review. I'm pretty sure I actually liked it even more the second time around and waiting for book three is pure torture. 
 --- 
 I finished ACOMAF three days ago and I am still reeling from everything that happened. I know it might be a bit early to say this since we're only halfway through the year, but I think ACOMAF is my favorite book of 2016. 
 I'm sure I could write my own novel regarding the things I loved about the book, so I'm going to try to keep this short and sweet and just list my favorite things: 
 I was obsessed with Tamlin at the end of ACOTAR. I was sure I'd go down with Feyre and Tamlin as my ship, so when ACOMAF changed that I was unsettled. But Maas pulls off this change of heart so well. There's no love triangle - it's Feyre getting out of a toxic relationship and environment, then finding the happiness she deserves with someone else. Another thing she does well? This ""change"" we see in Tamlin doesn't feel out of character. Maas does a great job of showing us and Feyre that this was how Tamlin acted throughout ACOTAR, as well. The only difference is that Feyre is no longer a human seeking protection - she's strong, independent, and refuses to be sidelined. And Tamlin? He doesn't know how to handle this. 
 Which leads me to my next favorite thing - Feyre's character development. Can Maas be get any better at this? If the answer is yes, please please please give it to me because I thought it was so brilliant in ACOMAF. I loved how she was strong, beautiful, independent - and she knew she was these things in the end and was not ashamed of it. 
 The introduction of all the new characters was perfect and I love them all, Maas's writing style blew me away, and everything felt so natural in the pacing that it was easy to believe everything. I'm honestly glad this was over 600 pages because anything less would have been way too rushed. 
 (view spoiler)[And lastly - RHYSAND! He is brilliant. The crappy things he's done and occasionally does in ACOMAF are never excused - he admits he's done bad things and attempts to atone for them. AND THEY ARE MATES! I adored everything about they're bond through the bargain and the bond in their souls (hide spoiler)] 
 Now, with all those beautiful things said (and so many more left unsaid) there are three things that leave me a tad bit bothered - and only slightly: 
 I feel as though a person could read this without having to read ACOTAR. This isn't a completely bad thing for me because ACOMAF blows it out of the water, but it just feels... weird. It's become a series in which the words ""get through the first and then the second is damn near perfect"" come out of my mouth when I recommend it. 
 Second, there are a few parts that get a bit slow and dry, but those are quickly made up for with the countless other parts that had my heart jumping for joy. 
 The last thing? How the hell am I supposed to survive the year until book 3? Because A Court of Mist and Fury has one of the best endings I have ever read."
0,"Good story; some editing issues that need to be ironed out, but overall I enjoyed it. Full review to come."
4,"I love Abbi Glines' books and was really looking forward to the conclusion of this series. However, whilst I enjoyed it, I felt a little bit like 'so what?' when I finished, it was over too quickly and it seemed like several chapters were missing from the middle of the book. My one major gripe were the errors in the book. For me, if I see grammatical mistakes or words missing it really disrupts the flow - I know there's a bit at the end explaining the editing, but at the very least, use a spellcheck!"
5,"Growing up in a household where Court TV was seemingly always on, I've known the Dahmer story for quite some time. I spent much of my young adulthood reading the stories of various serial killers so in a way, I felt as though I knew what to expect going into this; A story from a former classmate who was either trying to cash in on publicity or make us feel bad for a person who is essentially entombed in bitter infamy, and rightfully so. 
 Boy was I wrong. 
 Backderf begins his story by talking about how he felt empathy for Dahmer only up until the moment in which he decided to kill. By delving into this striking piece, you'll end up on the same page as him. Dahmer is portrayed as a troubled and quiet, yet attention-seeking young man who imitates his mother's epileptic fits and boozes on school grounds; In short, just as he historically was. There is no guise in this piece, no thought of ""what a poor, quiet boy."" Dahmer is presented as he was: twisted and troubled, yes. But certainly not a man to forgive and feel one-ness with. 
 I particularly enjoyed Backderf's commentary on the Dahmer parents, Lionel and Joyce. It's very interesting to me the things that our peers are able to glean from our personal lives through the small bits of our home we allow ourselves to share with them. 
 And, of course, nothing will ever beat that cafe scene with Backderf and his friends. (view spoiler)[""I bet he's a serial killer by now."" (hide spoiler)]"
5,"Wow! I read many reviews of those who LOVE this book and so I finally got around to check it and see what the fuss it about. Layken made for an adequete protagonist, at times I found her pretty immature and a bit of an idiot, but I chalk that up to my old age as I'm sure I would've been in her shoes at a freshly turned 18. But I digress...anyway, there are a number of element to this book that are touching, funny and heartfelt. There were several times when I had to stop myself from tearing up in front of the strangers on the morning bus ride *sniff sniff. 
 Overall, quite a nice read! I could see myself adoring this book if I were still in my teens but alas I remain wrinkled (not really) and jaded (yes totally), so I just give it a solid girlie wink of yay."
4,So deserving of this year's Newbery. Highly recommended; esp for city parents! More later.
2,"This was recommended to me because I am all about some fantasy adventure time. It was a cool read, but it was a rocky one for me. I give it two stars - I liked it enough to finish."
4,This the finale installment of Ms. Peregrines Home for peculiar children is indeed a rare treat. Jacob further develops his understanding of his own peculiarity. Overall it was a fitting and satisfying conclusion to the series.
4,"This book had such an intriguing premise, and it was well written too. The thing that interested me the most, though, is how different in style and voice it was from Schwab's adult book, Vicious. I'm always amazed when people can pull off one thing well and another thing equally well but completely differently. The voice in Vicious was spare and sophisticated, and while I liked the way she told this story too, it's completely a YA novel, while the other is completely not. I'm not saying you wouldn't enjoy one if you enjoyed the other (you would), or that teens shouldn't read the adult book (they should!), just marveling at the stylistic differences."
4,"I find I don't have very much to say about Flame. From the moment I put down my copies of both Glow and Spark, it was as if my fingers were possessed, desperately needing to type, to crow in glory, to shove this series into the hands of every unsuspecting bibliophile. After Flame, however, I remember sitting. Simply sitting, soaking up the lingering words in my mind. I was - and still am - very much shocked by the brilliance of this concluding installment. While I may not have much to regale about this novel - not without giving away spoilers, at any rate - Flame has been one of the few satisfying conclusions I've read in a very, very long time and I suspect it might remain that way for awhile to come. 
 Compared to its predecessors, Flame is a much slower novel than Glow or Spark were. And rightfully so. After the bitterness of violation, the anger of rebellion, the closed fist of anarchy, and the open strike of betrayal, these characters are exhausted. Kiernan and Waverly are now on the New Horizon, back under the influence of Anne Mather. Or are they? When Waverly meets an old doctor on board the New Horizon, she agrees to help him take down Anne Mather but, soon enough, she begins to question just who is the true enemy aboard the New Horizon. Meanwhile, Seth is - once again - a fugitive aboard a space ship, only this time it's the New Horizon. While he receives help from a small group of rebels aboard the New Horizon, his health is slowly deteriorating. All aboard on the same ships, friends and enemies alike, these teens don't know where - or who - to turn to. Despite having their parents back, they have been brainwashed by Mather and follow her blindly. Which means that, once again, Waverly, Kiernan, and Seth are alone. Only, this time, if they don't stop the evil aboard the New Horizon once and for all, they might not get another chance. 
 What makes Flame such a spectacular sequel is the fact that it stresses ideals such as redemption, friendship, and love. After writing such a bloodthirsty, violent series, Ryan comes back to these core values in a manner that never feels jarring but one that, rather, slips into the story line perfectly. Waverly and Kiernan, despite the differences they've shared, learn to set those aside and work together for the first time since their break-up. While they, along with Seth, try to infiltrate the New Horizon from within, though, they are no longer as convinced of Mather's cruelty as they once were. As they learn, Mather is not the only tyrant aboard the New Horizon. Escaped convicts from the prisons of the Empyrean have made it back to the New Horizon with the intent of wrecking havoc and Waverly's doctor has a following of adults who don't seem wholly trustworthy. Although these multiple villains may seem to overwhelm the plot, in reality they paint a picture of different kinds of evil. Mather has always been a villain with an extraordinary amount of depth and her gray matter is explored in even more detail within this installment. Although the other ""villains"" in this conclusion do not share the same degree of depth that Mather does, they nevertheless contribute to the slow, but constant, build-up to the climax of this tale. 
 As far as the plot goes, Flame is impeccable. It forces Waverly, Kiernan, and Seth to reach new heights as characters - areas from which they are able to look past the injustices done to them and the anger they feel. Ryan has truly made these teens transcend their barriers and the bumps they experience along the road are realistic. Additionally, this novel wraps up perfectly too. Ultimately, there are sacrifices that must be made and bittersweet separations as well, but I ended this novel utterly satisfied. While Flame is the most romantic installment to-date, its love stories never overwhelm the focus of the story. Although these romances remain minimal, they are heartfelt, equal, and true which I appreciated. Moreover, and perhaps best of all for me, is the fact that every loose thread is tied up, albeit not always in ways we want. Seth, Waverly, and Kiernan don't find the answers to all their questions, but they find enough to live by. Ryan has always been impeccably realistic, to the point of harshness, in this series and I loved that her stance on realism was never compromised in this finale. 
 Ever-so-slightly bittersweet, achingly romantic, heart-pounding action, and an influx of complex moral situations made this a conclusion to love. Amy Kathleen Ryan: write something else amazing! Quick!"
5,"Oh how I love you Rhage,I swear I've read this book like 6 times that how much I love this book. Words can't describe how amazing this book is 
 Rhage aka Hollywood is a sexy beast ;) Mary is the soft spoken human who doesn't think highly of herself. We get to see a different side of Rhage when he meets Mary, he's usually the goofy, flirtatious brother. But with Mary we see the softer side,the vulnerable side and I love it. I love the sacrifices that were made in this story.I have to say you wont be disappointed when you read Rhage's story."
4,"Absolutely loved this and read 60% of the book in two hours! Broke my heart a little bit, although I should have expected some ""impending fragmentation"" with a John Green book. Even though I couldn't stop reading, I'm not in a state of post-book paralysis, and there weren't really any amazing plot twists or anything so it gets 1 short of the full five stars. I loved Miles as the narrator and all the characters were great. I think The Colonel was my favourite character. 
 One of my favourite elements to the book was Miles' obsession with last words. I found it really interesting! 
 John Green left me once again questioning life and what the labyrinth of suffering really is."
4,"Funny and sweet. A light and quick read, perfect for those occasions when you wish to believe the world can be a happy place, even if only for a short time. (A healthy appreciation for 1920s culture doesn't hurt either!) Good fun."
4,"My only complaint: the last third of the book was slow and a bit too pat, with too many coincidences about running into people from her past."
4,"Over too soon! 
 I really enjoyed The Law of Attraction however I really wished it were a bit longer or had an Epilogue. Their was definitely potential for a second story if this were to become a series and I would be one of the first to read it."
5,"It's been a while since I read this, but I just wanted to say that Rick Riordan brought Greek Mythology to life for me. I had grown up learning in my own time about some of the myths and legends - familiarizing myself with certain stories and people/creatures/Gods. These books just topped it all. I absolutely love the whole lot of them, including the Heroes of Olympus, and that is all I can say. I am going to re-read the series, so I may update this review with more detail on this book specifically."
4,"Originally reviewed at Minnesota Reads. 
 I'd never heard of Blake Crouch until I stumbled upon the TV show ""Wayward Pines."" I don't remember exactly what episode I stopped watching the show, but it was the one where they revealed the big secret I know would've looked way better in my head than it did on the screen. I vowed I'd stop the show but read Crouch's next book, and I'm pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed Dark Matter, a mind-bending, plane-jumping, sci-fi thriller. 
 In Dark Matter, there are multiple planes of existence where there are copies of us living different lives. Every time we make a decision, we create a new plane where the other us makes the opposite choice, so the amount of planes is almost infinite. But our hero Jason doesn't know about these planes of existence. He's living happily with his wife and son until he's kidnapped one evening and thrown into another plane where he wakes up and is praised by people he's never met. So begins Jason's attempts to figure out what's going on and get back to the correct plane, but there are a lot of stumbling blocks in his way. 
 This is one of those books where the end of every chapter is a cliffhanger compelling you to turn the page. I had to keep turning the pages because I was just as clueless as Jason. His confusion was my confusion. His fear was my fear. It was emotionally draining worrying about whether or not Jason could actually find his way back when the available planes were endless. 
 But endless planes of existence was only the first issue Jason had to deal with. Towards the end of the book the twist I didn't see coming makes Jason's struggle one hundred times harder. And when I say I didn't see the twist coming, I really didn't, but I should've. It's actually quite obvious, but I was so emotionally connected to Jason and as confused as he was that I wasn't even thinking straight. The twist makes complete sense and made me question everything I was reading, which is exactly what you want in a twist. 
 This is a fast-paced, mind-fuck, thrill ride where just when you start to figure out what's going on, buckle up because you're getting dragged in a completely different direction. Pure fun."
1,"Steeeeeeeeeep right up, Folks! This ain't the fight your grandma wanted to see, but we're on and you haven't watched scrappy fighters like these in a while. I promise you, if you're looking for dirty, you'll get dirty. This ain't no alphabet soup match, what you see here issssss gonna be real! 
 Who will win? Who will lose? I don't know, it promises to be a real barnburner! 
 This fight was a tense one, because while College Boys was short and Frat Boy and Toppy really had some depth going for it, College Boys packed a better punch, beating the weak ending of Frat Boy and Toppy. 
 There's not much difference here, as it deals with a straight-until-proven-gay jock and a book smart gay guy who is out. College Boys' Jock was smarter than Frat Boy, but I hear Toppy is a fan favorite. 
 You'll notice I don't remember their names. I think there was a guy named Max? Maybe Paul, maybe Ryan. That might have been the pissy room-mate though, we kicked him off the mat when he got too involved in the match, no reaching through the ropes to help out your favorite, Javier! 
 Going into the fight, I thought College Boys was too much of a lightweight, granted it's only a hundred pages or so between them, but I honestly thought you couldn't compare a novella to a novel, as short as it was. And up until the final round, I was sure that it would be clear win for Frat Boy and Toppy, but College Boys persevered where the others stamina finally wore out. Once they came out, Frat Boy and Toppy were down for the count. 
 It was in the final round that I allowed myself to compare Frat Boy and Toppy to this fighter I saw a couple years ago when it was on netflix, one that looked more like a college project than an indie festival winner, even though it was great. I compared the coming out scenes, and found Frat Boy lacking in comparison to Defying Gravity. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defying_... It's always the veterns who do things better, huh? 
 All the previous development went out the window. Was the coming out supposed to be funny? Was the final sex scene supposed to be the eye of calm in a storm? A public kiss would have been a simpler and more satisfying ending. I see so many stories force a final KO. Whether it's an epilogue or just one final moment before the impossible tale ends, I'm not sure, but Frat Boy and Toppy, while putting up a tough fighter, left a lot to be desired. 
 College Boys was hotter on the mat, though there was some fluffing around at times, psyching himself up for a satisfying clinch that we all were waiting for. Also, that angst about the first couple hits that Frat Boy and Toppy tried to land? Totally worth it, not even the worst crying I've ever seen in a fight. Balanced out by all the vim shown in the other rounds. 
 And boy did that fight have some action, it makes me think that no one really knows why they think phone sex is hot, until they live on the other side of a very thin wall of someone they lust after. Then they think of it as a poor substitute. Don't deny it, just tune in when College Boys picks up the gloves again. You'll thank me, and stick around for the sequels while you're at it."
5,"I loved this!!! I was kept on my toes the entire time! As I say time and time again, I love drama, I love angst, I love suspense; I am such a drama queen! 
 I have had this book on my TBR for way too long. I'm glad though because book 2 comes out in a few days. I was surprised at how much I absolutely loved this. I love Carter Reed! This whole time I didn't know what was going to happen, who was the bad guy, so many twists and turns. I think reading other reviews held me off a bit, but we all know that every reader looks for something different in a book. I try to be cognizant of reviewers who tend to like what I like and to be aware of the biases of my Goodreads friends. In this case, I'm glad I ventured here because although I have read other books by Tijan, this one really had me on the edge of my seat. I can't wait to continue this story. I can imagine a sleepless night, as I finished this book in one sitting."
5,"Oh lord, I could not summon enough praise for The Nightrunner. I honestly have never been more obsessed with a series before. It consistently had me at the edge of my seat and biting my nails with such vivid suspense. The characters are so honest and believable that you quickly grow attached to them and it makes you concerned for their safety. Even if you are not an emotional masochist, it has enough passionate content to make anyone giggle and blush. The relationship between the main characters, Seregil and Alec, is just so touching and at times silly, cute, or even dramatic. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, but members of the GLBTTQ community in particular. And if that is not enough to keep you hooked, then the plot will have you up beyond sleeping hours. 
 The main character, Seregil i Korit Solun Meringil Bokthersa, better known as Lord Seregil of Rhiminee, is a character who is as interesting and complex as his name sounds. Flewelling evidently put a keen amount of care and attention into the development of her protagonist. Although Seregil plays the hero in The Nightrunner series, he does not always act as such. His questionable morals have led him down the path of spying and thievery, though his heart is still true. He has a dark past but a charming personality that lures the readers to follow his every step. He is charismatic, quirky, and sharp. The depth behind him creates a well-rounded identity that is thoroughly composed. He so perfect and flawed all at once and I crave to know what he is going to do next. There is a certain unpredictability that keeps his actions fresh. It is a pleasure to join him on his journey for he makes for wonderful company and entertainment. 
 Rambling about my affections for this book is only the tip of the iceberg; to fully comprehend the perfection of this series, you must read it. The only thing I could think to complain about is how thirsty I am for more! So if you are not familiar with this book, do yourself the favor and pick it up. Flewelling provided us readers with the wonderful gift of sharing her imagination. It is quite inspiring! I can safely state this is, without a doubt, my favorite book."
5,"What the hell! I can't wait for the next one... I've been so torn between which man I like the most. I'm leaning towards team Adam, he makes her happy."
5,It's been a while since I finished a book. Hopefully I'm back on track now. Anyways what a great ending to this series. I can't wait for the other stories. I know Easton is planning on getting a book but I kind of hope the twins and even Callum gets their own book too.
5,Love the voice of the drunken main character. Having her tell much of the story made it all the more riveting. Strong writing and plotting.
5,"ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE is many different books, depending upon the lens the reader brings to it. Although labelled literary fiction, on one level it is suspense. An invaluable blue diamond with a red core, the size of a robin's egg and pear shaped, has been removed from a museum in Paris when the Nazis invaded. Several exceptional copies have been produced, and the copies as well as the original are scattered throughout France as a means of keeping the true diamond out of the hands of the plunderers. Throughout the book, a German mineralogist, Van Rumpel, searches for the diamond, which may or may not have a curse upon it that keeps its owner alive while bringing disaster to all of his or her loved ones. At the same time, a young German radioman, Werner, develops the technology to triangulate radio signals and uses that technology to find partisans broadcasting information harmful to the Germans. A young blind French girl, Marie Laure, sits at the nexus of both searches. The diamond and the radio signals bring Van Rumpel and Werner to Saint Malo, whence Marie Laure has fled from Paris, just as the island comes under attack. 
 The book is also a treatise on the ways in which war affects the innocent, dealing with how difficult it is to be good during bad times. Both Werner and Marie Laure ask the question of who the ""good guys"" are. Marie Laure is literally blind to the circumstances, while Werner is encouraged to avoid the personal toll of his work as he tells himself, ""It is only mathematics."" As the book opens, we experience the childhoods of both, with Marie Laure hidden away from outside reality in Paris' Museum of Natural History where her father holds all the keys and Werner hidden away in his mind and the possibilities presented by radio waves and mathematics. In ways unbeknownst to them, they are connected even in childhood, but it is not until the end of the book that they actually meet. Knowing the two from childhood, and staying with them in alternating chapters as they grow up during the war, provides a keyhole into the personal damage WWII inflicted. 
 Werner and Marie Laure are the focus of the book, but all of the supporting characters are also well-wrought. Whether it's Werner's sister, who shares his love of the radio and sees the direction of the war well before he does, or Marie Laure's great-uncle, Etienne, who is late to join the resistance after having experienced the horrors of WWI, or any of the other amazing people populating the book, Doerr brings them to life. Reading the book is like taking a journey back to the early 1940s and meeting in person the individuals caught up in the war. 
 The writing falls away, on one level, as the individuals, their experiences, and the suspense take center stage. On another level, however, the writing is to be savored. The light we cannot see, as in the title, permeates the book. It seems that each page has a reference to light and its beauty. For Marie Laure, her non-seeing experience of the world is accompanied by vivid color. And for Werner, an understanding of radio waves and light as parts of the electromagnetic spectrum brings him to think of all light as invisible. What is seen and what is not seen is intensely important in this book. Just as light is complex, so is ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE. The book ends in keeping with that complexity; those looking for a resolution well packaged and tied up with a bow will not find this book to their taste.

4,"""You're not a bad guy, Sutter. You're a good guy. You just don't have a real firm grasp on the concept of consequences."" 
 Thus spake Bob. 
 I read quite a few reviews of this book before embarking on the journey myself, so part of me was braced for disappointment. I knew the ending would be realistic and somewhat depressing. I knew I'd want to grab Sutter by the shoulders and shake the everliving crap out of him, and I knew it would make no difference. But no matter how many reviews I read, there was no way to prepare myself for how utterly gutted I felt after I read the last page of this book. 
 Sutter Keely is a high school senior who likes to have a good time, an easygoing guy who understands how important it is to ""embrace the weird."" He goes where life takes him and never worries about the consequences. He has a super-hot girlfriend (though he may not be the most attentive boyfriend, but all the girls know better than to expect that from him) and a best friend since childhood who understands Sutter's booze-soaked lifestyle and indulges in a few illegal activities of his own. Sutter has it made. He may not be going places, but that doesn't matter. Even when Cassidy dumps him and Ricky starts to change, Sutter rolls with it. He puts his energy into making Aimee, the resident shy loser, into someone who can stand up for herself and have fun. Sutter Keely, hero! 
 Watching Sutter's behavior through his eyes, it doesn't seem so bad. He's totally fine. He's just drinking for fun; he Does Not Have a Problem. But there are subtle hints everyone else is becoming disenchanted with Sutter, things he sort of notices in his peripheral vision but doesn't really pick up on; it's like he sees their lips moving but doesn't hear the words. And even though I agree with the hostess of the party who throws him out because he ""doesn't know how to have fun like a normal person""; even though I want to shake him until his teeth chatter for what he's doing to Aimee and for blowing off all the potential life lessons... I like him. He reminds me of some people I've known. Addicts are fun, at first. They have great, larger-than-life personalities and they can suck you into their exciting lifestyle and make you feel invincible for a while. But they always take it just that one step too far. And you cannot fix them. You have to either watch them self-destruct or move on with your own life. 
 And that is the most heartbreaking part of this book: watching Sutter reach his expiration date and not even know it's happening. His friends are outgrowing him and everyone in his family has learned to function on an individual basis rather than as a unit, so he basically has no home life. Sutter pushes away the people who genuinely care about him because of his unwillingness to admit he has an addiction. He nearly destroys the one person who trusts him implicitly. He gives up chances to better his life because having the freedom to always have a buzz on is more important to him than anything--or anyone--else. 
 Even though I saw it coming, the ending hurt. In so many books--especially in YA, which this is--problems are fixed by the end, or at least tied up neatly. Not so for the Sutterman. There is no sweeping romance, no climactic event that triggers the realization that there is More to Life Than This. None of the lessons he learned stick around. There is just painful realism, just Sutter and his own spectacular now."
5,"Story begins with Callie who have been on the road for many years with her mother. Never having a stable job, bringing home random men, her mother was not the ideal woman but she would do anything for her. That is until one day they were yet leaving to another town and got pulled over. Callie was sent back to her father that she haven't seen since she was little and her mother went to jail. 
 Finding out that she has a huge Greek family is very overwhelming, especially after being alone for so many years. But falling in love and trying to learn how to trust her father is new to Callie and she is afraid that she might go into her mother's footsteps. 
 Where the Stars Still Shine is a story about finding who you truly are and trying to learn how to trust people. Well-written, detailed novel that made me want this story to never end. I loved reading about Callie and even though at times I didn't really like her character, I thought that she was always trying to be better. I do think it was kind of stupid how she was always trying to help her mom when it was obvious that she was using her. But I guess after the past that she had, it makes sense. 
 I always love reading stories about this sort of thing where personal trategy involved and the girl is messed up. I was amazed at the transformation that happened with her and loved the story. If you are a fan of Hopeless or Ten Tiny Breaths, this is the book for you!"
0,"He growls once more and then ends the call, spinning to me. ""Get in that room, now."" 
 ""Not sure that's a good idea,"" I say, taking a step back. 
 He lunges for me, catching hold of my wrist and hurling me so hard against his body he loses his towel. I squeal, but he keeps his arm pinned around me, pressing my thighs against his very naked body. His cock is resting on my belly, even though I can't feel the skin, I can feel it's presence there. 
 ""Your....your...."" 
 ""My fuckin' cock is on your stomach, if you keep misbehaving I'll find a better place for it."""
5,amazing...... love it!! love the new character Magiano!!!
5,re-read 2015. I would give this book more stars if I could. I have so much love for Cath. And for Levi. And Cath and Levi together.
1,"Well I was roped in by the ""like Gone Girl but even more disturbing"" hype. I suppose I should've known better. An attention grabbing first page, then it sort of goes nowhere. This book has ""first time author"" written all over it. I've read far worse, but this book is just not very accomplished. 
 My main problem is that the very dark subject matter is grafted onto a chatty first person narrative style better suited to chick lit, and it just doesn't work. For example, in chapter 9, we are cheerily informed that even though the damaged, traumatized protagonists car's gas tank is not yet half empty, she takes advantage of an ""unusually pristine BP"" to top off. Who cares? This is not relevant. The author then clumsily attempts to graft on some heavy-handed psychological insight with the following: ""I noticed with no small satisfaction that the attendant was locked away from me behind unbreakable plexiglass. If only everyone could be like that"". Umm okay. 
 That is the point where I stopped reading, and added The Never List to my ""never read"" list. Sorry, couldn't resist that."
2,"Phewph. I made it through. Plodding, labored, and not nearly as fun as the first two. I finished it for completeness's sake (and because I kept hoping for a 180 to redeem it) but I didn't enjoy it."
4,"Review also appears here https://wordsmalarkey.wordpress.com/ 
 There is a quote from the author in the acknowledgements 
 ""friendships can be just as epic as romances"" 
 And oh my god do I agree. I am such a lover of platonic friendships. Strong, real friendships, and that's what this book gave me. It gave me a beautiful friendship between two girls who love and support each other and who totally kick ass. 
 I know people have a problem with Safi because she's a special snowflake but I actually really liked her. She's sassy and has an attitude. Yes, she may make some stupid decisions that don't make sense but she made me laugh - she was fun to read about. Iseult, however, is my favourite. She's the introverted one, the quiet one who has so much more under the surface. 
 Merik is a character I'm not quite sure on. I went back and forth on whether I liked him. His relationship with Safi, while not being quite instalove... yeah okay it was instalove. I was hoping this book would subvert the cliche of the first female lead who talks to the male lead is the love interest. I was hoping for something else. I also HATED the way he would ""punish"" his crew. Whips and leg irons? What? Not cool. 
 The action really is non-stop. Pretty much from the first page there's no let up. It makes the book fast-paced and exciting but it's not always a good thing. There was never really any down time where we could just spend time with our characters, no time to get to know them when they weren't fleeing from one fight to the next. The dynamics at play were what kept me invested, but they sometimes got lost because things were so intense most of the time. 
 The world building wasn't quite enough for me. We get very little information about the different kinds of witches. There are so many terms thrown at you in such a short space of time that it's hard to keep up. It made it quite a slow read honestly, even with all of the action. I sometimes had to reread passages in case I missed a tiny clue about a specific term or something."
4,"About halfway through reading Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore, I sat the book on my nightstand and switched off my lamp. Before closing my eyes, I noticed that something was glowing. Yes, this book glows in the dark. 
 And that's what the whole thing was like. Lots of little surprises like a treasure hunt. Super geeky, but hipster geeky. It appealed to the book and independent book store and book ladder lover, video gamer (I've paid Blizzard my share), puzzle solver, and museum wanderer in me. Hey, this is where I first learned about Hadoop. 
 Glad I stumbled across this one. Make sure you pick up a real book or you will miss all the glowing."
5,"Knocked Devil in Winter from the top spot in my LK list. Glorious, graceful and a wonderful read. 
 This is a funny, tender twist on Cyrano DeBergerac. An animal lover awkward in bipedal company, Beatrix Hathaway assumes the identity of a beautiful friend who's put off by the emotional letters she receives from a swain in the army. This man had been the toast of the ton, a handsome, sought-after golden boy who turned his nose up at Beatrix. 
 Nevertheless, Beatrix's tender heart breaks for this man as he goes through the horrors of war and writes beautiful letters to her about it, in turn she offers him intelligent consolation and encouragement. These letters are moving, compassionate and so charming, he was bound to fall deeply in love with his penpal. Beatrix carries on the secret correspondence wtih the man until it must end abruptly. Then he returns to England, determined to marry the woman whose letters kept him sane and hopeful, the beauty. 
 Naturally, Beatrix loves the deeper, darker man the golden boy has become, but at first, he treats her like the oddity she has always been. How he comes to know who's who and what's what was wonderful. I cannot think of another couple I felt so strongly about finding their HEA together. LK has created two deeply sensitive, intelligent and funny people and I loved them both dearly. 
 I loved this one more than I can properly explain. I'm going to re-read this immediately... 
 Update: This wasn't the novel I thought it was but I still love it. Love it more the 2nd time. 
 I may be thinking of My Dearest Enemy, Connie Brockaway. 
 Out there somewhere is a story, in which a letter about a friend's death at war had me bawling my eyes out, and the heroine's reply was amazing, tender, wise and uplifting...must find it."
5,"I did a reread and it is still as awesome the second time around! It's an awesome stand-alone novel <3 
 --------------- 
 *shudders* I was on edge the entire time. 
 Also, I think it goes without saying that Jen has written another fine male specimen. GAH! How does she do it?"
2,"I'm a little disappointed because this should have been great and covered really important themes as well as the intersection between race/culture and sexuality, but the writing and some of the humour was a little too juvenile for me. I'd heard really great things about Sara Farizon. I also predicted basically every ""plot twist"" that happened. I am nearly twenty one so it might be that I'm just old. 
 It would be good for people who are twelve, thirteen, fourteen, or who are interested in the intersection between Iranian culture and homosexuality."
1,"first one was almost great. 
 this is also enjoyable, but not so much great."

4,"Even though I didn't always understand the technical details of the world of Shutter, I totally enjoyed spending time in it, despite all the horrors it contained. And, hey, if you are going to be surrounded by things that go bump in the night, who better to hang out with than a stubborn spitfire like Micheline and her boys? 
 I'd say if you enjoyed Jonathan Stroud's Lockwood and Co. series, then you will enjoy this book, as they have similar concepts, though Shutter is more gory than scary. 
 I do hope there will be a sequel, given the rather open ending."
4,"4.5 Stars 
 I'm obsessed. Moving on to book 3. 
 I went right from The Pawn to this book. Gabriel and Avery have a connection that neither totally understand but that I rooted for from the start. They are simply amazing together and so sexy. As the mystery around them unfolds, this book is unputdownable. And the series is getting better with each word."
5,"Love, love, loved it!!!! :D I couldn't have imagined a better ending! :) 
 Full review to come!"
5,"The gorgeous images more than make up for the lackluster writing in this new take on the graphic novel. The world that Brian Selznick has created is magical and inspiring, and I especially loved the inclusion of film stills throughout the book since they seemed to fit right in to the aesthetic of the story. Even though the book idealizes the realities of poverty a bit by giving Hugo a playground of a train station, it also doesn't try to glamorize Hugo's existence. This is very deserving of the Caldecott."
4,"4 stars 
 I'm glad that Vaugh was next. Faith is pretty awesome for having visions over take her brain on a regular basis."
4,"Gonna totally lie, and not spoil the ending of this book. Because that's basically what this book builds up on. 
 Or will I? (I really won't don't worry scroll on) 
 Cadence's family, the Sinclairs, come from old money. Old enough money to own their own island, Beechwood, and have four houses built on it. Harris Sinclair is the head of the family, and he gives a house to each of his daughters, Carrie, Bess, and Penny. Cadence is the daughter of Penny, and being the oldest grandchild, technically the one who will inherit the Sinclair fortune, although the other grandchildren (Cadence's cousins) Mirren and Johnny are close in age and all their mothers are competing for the family inheritance. There is also Gat, whose uncle Ed is dating Carrie, and stays with them every summer. 
 The old money luxurious lifestyle tied in with Harris Sinclair's dislike of the outsider Gat (and Gat does mention this in the book) had very The Great Gatsby and Wuthering Heights vibes. And this is kind of funny, because I loved the former and hated the latter. But, there was less of a focus on the forbidden romance/rich girl falling for poor outsider guy tropes. Instead, We Were Liars was one of those artsy poetic coming-of-age books. I know some people who read this did not like how the passages 
 were split 
 like this. 
 But, after finishing the book, I can see why E. Lockhart would choose to do this format. It carried her message much more strongly, and certainly had an impressive impact. 
 Check out the rest of my review here 
 at Wonderland Novels!"
4,Devastating but so SO good!
5,"Compelling MC romance. Lots of drama. Over the top alpha hero. Likeable heroine. 
 Not as intense smexually as I like but not a negative. 
 Heroine was still married when she meets hero. Her husband was an abusive p.o.s. Normally I avoid reading about heroines who were married prior and not a virgin but this heroine was quite likeable and sweet. 
 A good read."
3,"WHY !!!! why would you do this to your devoted readers ?! 
 I'd give it a one star rating just out of spite and anger. The book took too long to get interesting but than snap ! All your nerves split and you are in agony reading ... crying (like in my case) and yelling out loud while people rush to you wondering what the hell is happening to you. 
 It takes 40 pages to destroy everything we loved about this series. I want take some memory serum and forget what I have read. 
 I spent days avoiding all kind of social networks in fear of a spoiler. UGH !!! I want to go live under a rock and stay there until I feel normal again. 
 I just want to feel normal again ... The book has no closure at all. I don't think I can read a book again for a while."
4,"This is the first Heather Rainier book I've read and I enjoyed it, save for the sometimes too much mush. 
 Grace is a plus-size woman who has a good-for-nothing boyfriend. Jack Warner lives with two room mates Ethan Grant and Adam Davis. The 3 of them knew and have been waiting for the perfect woman who would love them and they found Grace, saved her from the life she was living. 
 Basically, there's little conflict here in the presence of Grace's ex, Owen who's a bum and treats her harshly, she worked two jobs for him and they always have sex in the dark because Owen says he doesn't want to see Grace's fat body. That really isn't the case but we later find out. 
 Grace is described as someone voluptuous, with all the right curves a man, or in this case, three men would want. She has been attracted to Jack for a long time, and is close with his mom, who passed away in the beginning of the story. I really like the philosophy and positive attitude Mrs Warner influenced on Grace, to just ""seize the day!"" 
 The attraction with Ethan and Adam happened really fast and from then on, things started to progress and dumping Owen is step #1. 
 To cut the long story short, there are a lot of pampering until Grace is spoiled rotten, she regained her self-esteem and is now more confident in dealing with shallow women who don't understand true love between a woman and her three men. There's only 1 major menage with all of them in it, the others are just teasers but they're hot. 
 Ms Rainier has now become one of the authors whose works I'll read more of."
4,"Well I loved the cover and totally had a different idea on what this one was gong to be about. I was not expecting a robot that's for sure. 
 Twenty years before 2071 when humans were fighting a war with the help of robots things went wrong. The robots that were designed to help humans became their number one enemy. Now with only a small amount of people that escaped they try to service the world with out being captured. 
 Cass, Nick and Kevin are three siblings that live with their parents and others in a community in the woods while trying to survive and stay out of the reaches of the robots. But one day there community is found out and the robots are taking prisoners including their parents. So the three siblings risk everything to save their parents even if that getting there self captured and maybe even more. As soon as they reach the city there parents have been taken too they are not so sure what they will do to find them. They are not familiar with the way the people in the city live and now they will need to seek out some help. Cass, Nick and Kevin and now faced with the one question they never wanted to ask them self's, ""How do we save our parent's?"" 
 Revolution 19 was a pretty good book. I really enjoyed the action the most in this one and the drama that went a long with it. It was a little slow for me in the start and had me a little worried but then things kicked off. 
 I really liked how the story stays with these three siblings and touched on each one and how the world they are living in now is affecting them. Their journey to find their parents was page turning. Once they make it to the city, where the robots have taken there parents things get even better. They meet new characters that you will love just as much, and they start to make some hard decisions. 
 Revolution 19 was some what like that kind of book you want to jump into and hang with each character because they ALL have some awesome trait you just love. Gregg Rosenblum defiantly made this one a GREAT read for 2013 and an action packed story filled with all different types of characters and mystery and so much more!"
4,"Honestly I have very mixed feelings about this book. It wasn't what I was expecting, I thought it would have a lot of action and it didn't. The plot was amazing and I liked the whole concept of the arranged marriages. I liked the way the author described the characters. I loved Bishop (actually I wish there were more boys like him and please God make some come to me). But the whole time I was reading this book I felt like something was missing. In the end I realised that the problem was Ivy. Don't get me wrong, she was strong, and stubborn, and badass. And the choice she made was a really hard one. But I wouldn't have made the same one. We weren't given our lives to throw them away, at least not without a good reason. 
 Anyway, any book that makes you truly think about something important is a book worth reading in my opinion. And so I definitely recommend this one."
3,"Real rating is more of a 2.5 
 Well that sure was disappointing. This book was one of my most anticipated reads of the year. I seriously could not wait to get my hands on it. I had such high hopes and none of them were met. 
 Sure the book was full of mystery and action just as the first but there was something missing in this one. Something more. I didn't feel as into it as I did book one. Maybe it was because I read it while in a terrible reading slump. Maybe it was because this book was simply not as good as the first. Either way it was not what I expected. 
 In this book Anna is on the run with Sam, Cas, and Nick. They have a good routine going on up until ghosts from their past start coming up and secrets start to be revealed. This is where we get to learn a little bit more about nick and find out that maybe he isn't the hostile jerk he wants everyone to think he is. Which leads me to think: Love triangle! I mean Anna has yet to express feelings for Nick but this book definitely sets the ground of it. Here we find out that their relationship goes way back and it is far deeper than is first shown. 
 The thing that truly got to me was the end when thy finally think they are free. I actually had to double check that there would be a third book because the end was the typical happily ever after. I honestly don't know where the story can even go from there. 
 Despite all the feelings of disappointment I am extremely excited to read the next and see where this story ends up. I'm not as excited as I was for his one but I'm excited enough. I want to see how this Nick thing will be resolved and if the boys will ever get free. Plus there is going to be a dual perspective so no one better die!"
4,"I think I liked this one a little more than The Resistance, although it's close... it's a really fascinating concept to finish off the series with - a virus has come along that those on the Longevity drugs are susceptible to, and there's no known cure, so bodies are mounting up all over the world... Richard Pincent blames the Underground, says that they've contaminated a batch of the drug which is what's making people ill, but that it's all under control... 
 (view spoiler)[There are lots of twists and turns, the most epic being the whole Pip is a traitor NO WAIT Derek is actually good AND ALSO Pip is actually Albert... and he and Derek have been secretly working together for a few hundred years, just waiting for this sort of thing to happen to prove to Richard that Longevity is not the way of the world. Man, they must be patient. 
 I didn't like Sheila so was a bit bored whenever she was on the scene. I really enjoyed the brief stories of other Londoners, adults on the drug who fell ill or saw others fall ill etc. And I absolutely loved the ending, with teenage Molly finding that the image on the ring was made up of letters and symbols... (hide spoiler)]"

 ""I know you by heart."" 
 I loved 
 Neanderthal Seeks Human 
 so I was so excited to hear there would be more of Janie and Quinn! And it was fantastic. I loved getting more of Janie's hilarious antics and Quinn's alpha nature. Neanderthal Marries Human was full of heart, humor, and steam, and a charming addition to their story. 
 Janie and Quinn have been dating for about five months and it has been bliss. Quinn is always taking her breath away, treating her wonderfully, and they have an amazing relationship that is everything she wants. However, one moment changes everything. When Quinn pops the question it catches Janie completely off guard and they realize there are things they must work through if they want their HEA. What follows is a wildly entertaining journey to the alter. 
 ""...we're having a big wedding so we can be miserable together before we're happy together."" 
 I loved it! It is laugh-out-loud funny and super sweet. There is so much jam packed in this book and I ate it all up. Everything from the humorous interactions to the sweet and sexy moments to even the more serious situations, I loved it all. 
 Quinn is such a gentleman and totally swoony. His ever present protective streak and alpha tendencies were fantastic. I loved how completely head over heels he was for Janie. Quinn would do anything for her to make her happy and to take care of her. I adored how he was genuinely interested in her and everything that came out of her mouth not matter how OTT it was. He's not a simple character though and I loved that there was more to him than meets the eye. I hated the guilt and pain he harbored inside and all I wanted to do was take that pain away exactly like Janie was able to do. 
 ""How do you do that?"" His question was quiet, reverent. 
 ""Do what?"" 
 ""How do you make everything better?"" 
 My forehead wrinkled as we studied each other. ""What did I make better?..."" 
 ""You make me better."" 
 Janie was geeky and wonderful as always. She put a permanent smile on my face the entire book with her fun and quirky personality. There isn't a person who wouldn't love Janie from the beginning. I loved not knowing what was going to come out of her mouth next and how she had to analyze everything. The kooky thoughts about getting married so quickly and her behavior surrounding the wedding had me laughing-out-loud. 
 ""My brain was at war with...my brain. My heart and my body were ambivalent. It was all brain-on-brain brawling. 
 Even with the change in status, their relationship is as solid as ever and the chemistry is still scorching. They can't keep their hands off each other and it is entertaining to watch them try. They trust each other and are loyal and honest, and I loved them together. 
 Like all Reid novels, the side characters are amazing and each played an important part in Janie and Quinn's lives and I loved them. I can't wait to get my hands on the next books in the series and see where everyone ends up! Overall, another great rom com by Penny Reid. 
 ""Loving unconditionally brings only joy."" 
 *Note: I listened to the audio version and it was fantastic! Janie's narrator was wonderful and we also get Quinn's POV narrated by the talented Sebastian York!! I highly recommend this audio!"
5,"Warning: If you have not read The Winner's Curse there will be spoilers for the first book, however, I will not spoil any details for this book in my review. 
 The Winner's Crime doesn't disappoint at all. It's a fantastic sequel to The Winner' Curse that's packed with political intrigue, romantic angst, and a main character you'll root for the entire way through. 
 ""If you won't be my friend, you'll regret being my enemy."" - Kestrel 
 When I read The Winner's Curse last year, I was obsessed. I had never encountered in a YA fantasy where the main female protagonist was strong in the sense that she was good at strategy and thinking two steps ahead of any of her opponents. Combine that with an intense plot with political intrigue and revolution and I was hooked. So as you can imagine The Winner's Crime was one of my most anticipated releases of 2015. Was I disappointed? NOPE I FREAKING LOVED IT. 
 Kestrel remains one of my favorite characters ever. Period. Her sharp mind remains intact, but what I loved about her in The Winner's Crime is that I got see the more emotional side of her. While I felt this kind of disconnect with Kestrel in the first book, I was so happy that I got this more fleshed out Kestrel in the second one. I felt for her more, and I was rooting for her because of that. Now Arin was so frustrating. There is a line in this book where Kestrel tells him he's not listening or thinking clearly. That line perfectly summed up the relationship between Arin and Kestrel perfectly. There was constant miscommunication. Following the events of the The Winner's Curse, there needed to be long conversation between those two but of course this is a YA book so there had to be obstacles. I still really enjoyed it, and I saw the why Marie Rutkoski set up the misunderstanding between them to get Arin where he needed to be. 
 In this installment there's alot of new characters. The Emperor is so evil and calculating, and the way Marie portrayed him through his actions and words really embedded into me that he is truly someone to fear in this world like Kestrel feared him. (view spoiler)[The fact that this guy used Kestrel's knife in an assassination attempt on Arin was so evil and kinda scary! (hide spoiler)] Other interesting characters introduced are Risha, Tensen, Verex, Roshar, and the Queen of the East (did we ever get a name?). Out of all them I found, Verex and Risha the most fascinating especiallly with what learn later on in the book! I cannot wait to see what role they play in the last book. As for familiar faces, the reappearance Kestrel's father, General Trajan. In the first book, I only got this impression of him as this very distant, unemotional father to Kestrel. In The Winner's Crime, we get more, and I loved what Marie gave us. There is a moment between him and Kestrel that is so bittersweet I cried. (view spoiler)[I also couldn't believe but wasn't surprised that General Trajan turned Kestrel over for treason to the Emperor. It really made me hurt for Kestrel, and I just really wanted to give her a hug. I cried my eyes out over this betrayal to be honest (hide spoiler)] Other familiar characters are Jess and Ronan and it's pretty depressing to see where things go with them. 
 The plot and writing are just as fantastic in the first one. I mean I really like the political intrigue that went on in this book. We get way more of it, and it's just really interesting to see how everything plays out and how everything connects. I definitely cannot wait to find out what happens in the next and last book of this amazing trilogy. 
 Overall this is a well-crafted YA fantasy with lots of angst, a fierce main character, and fantastic plot!"
3,"Edit: I wrote at length about this book on Clear Eyes, Full Shelves: http://cleareyesfullshelves.com/blog/... 
 This was an interesting read. There's a lot of elements that feel very possible to me, including the political stuff and the food contamination disaster. I do wish the author hadn't been so heavy handed with the characterization of the bad guys and they'd been more nuanced and there are a number of world building issues related to the food contamination disaster. I also could've done without the animal death scene; I know it was meant to shock and illustrate the ruthlessness of the bad guys, but it I kind of already knew they were terrible. 
 But with that said, I read this book in a couple evenings and found it very hard to put down. I think there's going to be a sequel and I'll definitely be picking that up."

2,"2 1/2 
 Fresh on the heels of the Enola Holmes series, I was on something of a kick - so when I came across the notion of a story showing us a boy Sherlock Holmes and how he came to be who he was, I was certainly intrigued. 
 Unfortunately, I had some major issues with the story. 
 Now, there were parts of it which were interesting and Peacock seems to have given some serious thought to a background story which could possibly lead the adult Holmes to be how he was. 
 On the other hand, it read like many a usual detective novel, with the boy Holmes sort of blundering around looking for clues and almost accidentally coming across some bits - and having a good deal of help with others. Now, granted, this is his first case so we can't expect him to have the same deduction skills he develops - but, on the other hand, I had a hard time figuring out how this made a Holmes story, per se. Aside from some details and names, it felt like a dozen other YA mystery books I've read. 
 Also, I sort of got tired of the names and faces parade. 
 At one point Holmes meets a kindly jail visitor named Andrew C Doyle, which I could only see as a shout-out to original Holmes creator Arthur Conan Doyle. Mr. Doyle also has a young daughter who is interested in justice and who is introduced to the shadier sides of life through the case of the name of Irene. I presume she is the Irene Adler to be - introduced to the criminal element through Holmes, no less. 
 Also, Holmes is often tormented, then helped, but a gang of ruffians lead by someone called the Malefactor, who is as brilliant as Holmes and who has a grudging respect and yet hatred for our intrepid young detective. Obviously Moriarty in the making - he's even referred to as a young Napoleon of crime at one point. 
 The detective who gives Holmes and his family such trouble is elder Lestrade, and in the course of the book Holmes views younger Lestrade helping out his father. 
 A newspaper vendor who is friendly towards Holmes is called Dupin, which I imagine is a shout-out to Poe's detective C. Auguste Dupin - a character which laid the foundation for Doyle's Holmes in the first place. 
 And, lastly, in one scene we briefly see a young medical student who was a bit stout around the middle. I actively rolled my eyes at this point on the assumption that this was a glimpse of a young Watson. 
 Now, sometimes I read stories which have these little shout outs and things and I can smile - usually those stories are more humorous in tone, though. In this book which was ever-so-serious (sometimes rather melodramatically so), it just seemed twee. (And while I'm not a purist, per se, introducing Holmes to Irene Adler and Moriarty at a young age just plays with the timeline far too much for my tastes.) 
 Anyway... aside from all that, and the melodrama, there's also the fact that it just sort of meandered on. Again, I don't expect the young Holmes on his first case to come in and solve it in 5 minutes, but nor do I expect him to wander practically aimless for days on end, either. Towards the end of the book I flipped ahead to see how many pages I had left because it just seemed to develop far too slowly. 
 All that aside, it wasn't terrible, and I see potential here. I may pick up the second book at some point to see if the general narration gets any better - tighter, more fast paced, less riddled with oh-so-clever easter eggs... because it is an interesting, if not entirely original, conceit and I do think it offers some possibilities."
3,amazinggggggggg .. i want the next one NOW!
2,"I don't know why I bothered to the read the second book when I disliked the first one so much. I guess I was hoping it would be better, well. No. Still not a fan of these books, though I'm starting to see how some people might be"
4,"Lost at Sea is the debut graphic novel of Brian Lee O'Malley - you might know him from his Scott Pilgrim books. Lost at Sea is more whimsical and lyrical in its writing. Text floats throughout the panels, sometimes a page only has one image, and most of the text is internal monologue. I loved the idea of this book, and it's incredibly quotable with amazing haunting images. The four-colour scheme adds to the ethereal quality of the book. My only gripe is that the ending was too abrupt. It was almost as if he ran out of pages to make his point, and squished them in the last two instead of making a proper final climax. For a debut, Lost at Sea is pretty amazing."
4,"I can't even explain myself. 
 I'm not a big fan of how the most intriguing dimensions of the female characters in these books appear to be those of their breasts. I am not the only person who has noticed this. 
 I also am not partial to the ridiculous and eye-rolling depths of Dresden's paternalistic chivalry. Apparently, he is personally responsible for every bad thing to ever happen to anyone in Chicago (and surrounding areas), ever. Give it a rest pal. Dresden actually trots out the old ""With great power comes great responsibility"" cliche in this book. I wish I was kidding. 
 And the silly miscommunication between Murphy and Dresden at literally every turn. Have a conversation! Like adults! 
 But I can't put this shit down! And overall, I think it's really fun and different (at least in terms of the magic system - the wounded detective tropes abound here). I actually think this book was much better than Storm Front, which is why I gave this one 4 stars instead of 3. If I tried to compare this 4 to other books in the 4 category, my rating would not stand up to any kind of serious scrutiny. So, I'm just not going to think much about it. It was fun. I couldn't put the book down. There were some issues, but I liked it anyway. 4 stars. 
 I listened to the audiobook narrated by James Marsters who was really fantastic. The production quality is not great (mouth sounds, etc), but I didn't really care. Great performance."
2,"Derry, Maine seems like any other small town in the US except for its dark history. Death and disappearances are the norm and every 27 years they peak as more and more children are killed. When Bill's brother Georgie is killed by It, the mysterious thing behind Derry's darkness, Bill sets out to find it. Bill becomes part of a group of other children, all who have had run ins with It and together they get rid of It. They swear an oath to return to Derry if It ever comes back and starts killing and 27 years later they all return to face down It and try to get rid of It once and for all. Don't read past this point because I can't promise anything about no spoilers. 
 I finally finished this god damn tome of a book, and I really wish I weren't so compulsive and obsessive about finishing every book I start because wow that was 1400 pages and I couldn't get into the story at all. Also I have a few questions and I feel like I may have missed something so if someone could answer these questions I would appreciate it and maybe then I might feel better about the book. First off it's mentioned that none of gang have children and it's alluded to as being part of what happened the first time with It but I didn't understand what that had to do with anything? Was there an actual explanation to this or was it just supposed to be there to be ~creepy~. Second why did they have to go out of their way to find It and get rid of it that first time, if It has cycles of 27 years wouldn't It eventually just have stopped on its own anyways because there's no way someone banished it every time it appeared because they're supposedly the only ones to have done so. Lastly what was the point of them having sex in the sewer, I'm not a prude but having 12 year olds do it in the sewer should have a better explanation than to bring them all together and bond them. I don't see how they had to do at all did he just put that in there to be outrageous because good job it worked. 
 At times I did enjoy the book but it was just really long with so many characters and details and a lot of the time I felt myself getting bored like I didn't need such exact descriptions of the boat flowing down the sewer and the way it kept cutting back and forth especially towards the end between past and present just felt choppy and maybe that was the point but it just made me not get really into the book. When I read horror I have to lose some self awareness and get pulled in so I can be creeped out but the whole time I was too aware that I was reading a book and I just kept feeling like it wasn't scary at all. Especially with It morphing constantly like werewolves don't freak me out so I was just like wow a werewolf thats cool I guess. 
 I do like Stephen King and he writes very well but this one just did not work for me and I guess I just missed something because everyone else seems to have really enjoyed this book."

5,NECROMANTIC LAWYER-WIZARDS INVESTIGATING THE MURDER OF A GOD.
5,"Oh that was really, really good. I read it all in one setting. I thought the writing, pacing and characters were excellent. I rarely give five stars, but this was a surprising, disturbing read that I think will stay with me for awhile."
5,"I liked this one. Adam's ex wife is being threatened by a dangerous stalker, and moves back into Adam and Mercy's home to stay safe. Meanwhile, a fae Gray Lord is demanding the walking stick back from Mercy, but she had already passed it on to Coyote. So now she is dealing with both her husband's ex and trying to get back the walking stick to avoid a conflict with the Gray Lord. 
 There is, of course, action in this book. What Mercy Thompson book doesn't have action? But it is the interpersonal relationships that made the book interesting. How do you stand your ground with your husband's ex without seeming/becoming vindictive or insecure? What about when your husband is a pack leader, and members of the pack liked his ex-wife (for whatever reason), but don't yet fully accept you? 
 Those who gave the book a poor review disliked it for the same reasons that I liked it. By putting Mercy in a position where she couldn't just fight her way out of we see yet another side of her. I thought that was cool, even if I did feel a little angry on Mercy's behalf. I have enough faith in the author that she would make it work (which I think she did)."
3,"3-3.5 stars 
 I'd rate this book higher, but I considered it a ""cheat"". The author withheld valuable clues from the reader or presented clues (such as old photos) that the reader couldn't see and weren't described fully, so there was no way to truly solve this mystery. The readers have to sit back and allow DCI St. Just to do it for us. Not my favorite way to read a mystery. 
 My other reticence in reading this book was that I got the impression from reading the book's description that this was set in Victorian times. But when I started reading, I realized that it was set in modern times; somehow that turned me off. But when I picked the book up again, once I got through the first couple of chapters, I did find it intriguing. Quite a cast of characters - the Beauclerk-Fisk family and family servants. Sir Adrian Beauclerk-Fisk is a horrid 70-something man who delights in torturing his children with his ill-humor and by constantly changing his will. None of them know who will be in or out, and while only Albert, the actor, is in need of money, as Sarah says, they grew up equating money with love - so all 4 children want to be the most loved and so, in the will. 
 Sir Adrian sends his family and his ex-wife vulgar invitations to an engagement party. Yes, he's marrying again. His four children (Ruthven, George, Albert, and Sarah) decide that to not attend this party is likely to get them written out of the will, no matter how horrid the event might be. And none of them can quite miss the chance to meet their new mama-to-be, assuming her to be younger than any of them (all 40-something). Of the four, only Ruthven is married, to the prissy and proper Lillian (or Lilith, as Sarah calls her); but none have children of their own. 
 When they arrive, the sibling rivalry begins in earnest. They learn that their father is already married, and to Violet Mildenhall Winthrop no less. Violet is the notorious woman who most think murdered her first husband, Lord Winthrop some 40+ years ago. A Welsh guest by the name of Davies gave her an alibi by saying that he was in bed with Lady Violet at the time Lord Winthrop's head was bashed in. But then Davies seemed to disappear... 
 Albert, a heavy drinker, knows that his father's best is kept in the cellars. While rooting around the cellar, he discovers his father's current manuscript entitled ""A Death in Scotland"". Albert decides it must be about the Lord Winthrop murder, because that's where it took place. But his father insists upon hand writing his manuscripts on air mail paper, and his handwriting is impossible to read. Albert doesn't want to ask Jeffrey, the American secretary, to transcribe for him, since Albert isn't sure what the manuscript is about and if it has any bearing on his father's actions. And then, when Albert discovers his eldest brother, Ruthven's body with his head bashed in stuffed into a corner of the cellar, Albert wants to be certain that the manuscript wasn't why Ruthven was killed. 
 DCI St. Just suspects more to come in this nestful of vipers. No one seems particularly broken up by Ruthven's death - not his father nor his wife. And sure enough, just a day or so later, Sir Adrien is found dead in his study - killed by a Scottish dirk through the heart. 
 -------------------- 
 As I said, this book was a ""cheat"" to me, because vital clues were kept from the reader. For example, DCI St. Just comes across pictures from the original Scotland house party of the Winthrops, where he recognizes several faces. Except that the author doesn't describe what St. Just sees, and we don't have a copy of the picture, so HOW can we possibly understand what conclusions St. Just draws upon to solve the case? Aggravating, for a mystery buff! Since I was old enough to read, I've read mysteries and loved being able to solve them before the detective in the book or at least at the same time. 
 Not sure I'll continue with the St. Just series."
5,"I liked this a lot, it was a simple read and quick so it didn't completely delve into Dali and Jim having a relationship, but apparently there will be another full length novella soon so I can't wait to read that too. Jim needs Dali's help with locating one of the packs places and pack members missing. While there Jim sees a symbol but can not remember it, that isn't normal for Jim, something is wrong with him and Dali is going to help him."
3,"Actual Rating 2.5. 
 Instalove- I hate. 
 Very Buffy the vampire feeling- Military guy falls for the person he shouldn't but not written well at all. 
 Serious characters -like her dragon trainer- who are supposed to be all scary and serious come off as comedic. 
 A hot headed MC who makes some of the worst decisions ever in life. 'I'm going to go off alone and fight this master dragon all on my own, and I think I can win even though I only have like 2 months of training...' Right 
 It was interesting and I will probably continue the series in hopes that the characters mature and evolve a bit, but overall I was disappointed by a book form an author that I have heard amazing things about."

 Whether they're YA or NA, I tend to love Jennifer Echols books. I have to admit, I felt a bit old reading this one though. Don't get me wrong, it was a fun read, but it was full of teenage angst that, at my age, I can't fully appreciate any longer. The book had some great fun and flirty moments and I loved the chemistry between Tia and Will from the very beginning. It was the lack of communication and Tia's wishy-washiness that were a little harder for me to take. But, I really liked both Tia and Will, especially as I began to learn more about both of them. Biggest Flirts presented an interesting role reversal in which the girl wants the physical relationship only and the guy wants more. I enjoyed that flip. 
 Biggest Flirts was a fast read. I couldn't even think of putting it down, even when the characters made me want to scream at them because they weren't doing what I wanted them to. (Yes, that's a thing I do. I get very upset when characters I like do stupid things or can't make up their minds.) I would say this one is definitely on the upper spectrum of the YA scale if for no reason other than the language and the sexual content. Which, of course, didn't both me a bit, but I felt like I should mention it for a younger audience. 
 My actual rating would be closer to 3.5 stars than 3, but since Goodreads, Amazon nor B&N allow half stars... I'm going with 3. I know I'm a bit outside the target demographic for this book and I've taken that into consideration. I do believe readers in that demographic wouldn't be as discouraged by the teenage angst as I was. I think they'd be more likely to take it in stride, where I looked at it as a bit over-the-top. 
 I think Jennifer has a solid start to her new Superlatives series with this book and I'm eager to see what comes next! 
 I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."

2,"I was intrigued by the first story to get the sequels. Unfortunately, they were a disappointment. Shay Savage is a decent storyteller but I couldn't quite get what she was trying to do here. As a romance, there's not enough of it. As suspense/action, it's way over the top. 
 Fixation on the anal sex didn't help much. I know it's erotica so anything goes... but I got the feeling the dude wasn't totally satisfied until he got into the backdoor. 
 The series reminded me of Leonard Cohen's song The Future. 
 Give me back my broken night 
 my mirrored room, my secret life 
 it's lonely here, 
 there's no one left to torture 
 Give me absolute control 
 over every living soul 
 And lie beside me, baby, 
 that's an order! 
 Give me crack and anal sex 
 Take the only tree that's left 
 and stuff it up the hole 
 in your culture 
 Give me back the Berlin wall 
 give me Stalin and St Paul 
 I've seen the future, brother: 
 it is murder."
4,"My full review is available (in French, sorry) on the blog. 
 I loved this book so much. My issue with it was the pace. The main character didn't really now what was going on until p. 200 and even after that they were still hiding things from her. It really felt like a first book in the sense that it felt like an introduction to a series. Nevertheless, it was gripping and so well-researched. I need more swoony-worthy moments to be honest. I'm dying to get my hands on book 2!"
5,"If I had a cent for every time someone writes a story about a redheaded vampire slayer with enough cojones to level an entire small American town, I'd have enough money for at least one Freddo Frog. Maybe two. But this isn't one of those books, this one is better and I'm about to tell you why in one word. Bones. 
 In this first book of Jeaniene Frost's Night Huntress series, our heroine Cat Crawfield is not much more than a sassy Mary-Sue, or in this case - a Buffy-Sue. She has potential to be fabulous and over the course of the series she becomes more and more fabulous until people start reading the series for her rather than Bones. But this book is about the beginning of a (my) love affair with one of the most well written vampires from paranormal romance. He's quirky, emotional, can carry off a blonde dye job with aplomb and has the most darling British accent outside of the motherland without sounding like a toff, or Hugh Grant. Plus he's a bounty hunter and that means he rides a bike - and not one of those silly fixies either. 
 Bones 
 Bones is over two-hundred years old, a master vampire who was changed whilst paying his dues in a penal colony in Australia. Son to a London doxy, (well I presume this to be the case, due to all of the 'luvs' in the book I would hate to think he was from Buckingham) he followed in his ma's footsteps - lying, thieving, whoring and generally having a whale of a time until his change at the age of twenty-four. 
 Catherine Crawfield is friendless and weird. Living in the middle of nowhere, Ohio her mother is still the talk of the town for giving birth to her illegitimately twenty-two years ago. She's pretty to look at but hides herself behind a bushel of baggy clothes, bad hair and a surly tongue. Cat likes to keep her profile on the down low due to the fact that her father is a vampire. That exciting fact makes her half vamp. Something very special indeed. Unfortunately, dear old dad did the dirty on her mum and left her high and dry after a nasty case of date rape. Her mother never got over the horror and for this we feel really sorry for. But that's about it because for the rest of the time she is an annoying pain in the ass who needs a bitch slap like a fish needs water. She makes her daughter feel insecure about herself and her appearance, allowing her to be distrustful and resentful of both people and vampires. Sorry, I'll leave the mothers out of this... but urgggh! 
 Cat tries to make up for the fact that she is half vamp by going gently out into that good night and eradicating as many vampires as she can. She is also on a one woman mission to find her father and make him pay for what he did. So starting at the age of sixteen, she lures vampires into her clutches with a flash of legs and her pearly whites before staking them and burying their bodies in parts unknown. 
 The clock struck eleven and Cat the vampire huntress was on the loose, except my battle armor was a push-up bra, curled hair, and a short dress. Yeah, it was a dirty job, but I was going to do it. Come one, come all, bloodsuckers! Bar's open! 
 But that all comes to an end one night when she runs into Bones at her local watering hole. After a game of who's got the balls to start stripping first so that the other can try and kill you (I name this new game strip chicken), he wins and turns the tables on Cat, wanting to know what the hell she is up to. 
 ""I thawt I thaw a putty tat."" 
 The mocking voice caused my pain to dissipate in a rush of terror. When I saw the vampire close by, I shuddered. 
 ""I did, I did thee a putty tat!"" 
 Finished with his Tweety Bird imitation, he grinned unpleasantly at me. I tried to scoot back and realized my hands were chained to a wall. Both my feet were also cuffed together. My top and pants were gone, leaving me in only my bra and underwear. Even my trademark gloves were missing. Oh God. 
 ""Now, then, luv, let's get down to business."" The bantering left his tone and his eyes hardened into pools of dark granite. ""Who do you work for?"" 
 Bones recruits Cat and trains her to become his one woman army. Smitten from the get-go, he needs her help and special half vamp skills to investigate a case where women have been going missing from all over Ohio and beyond. To do this he gives Cat a much needed make over and teaches her the finer points of knife throwing. But she becomes a little too good at this... 
 ""I love that you did it to protect me, but next time, try aiming to wound, hmm? You know, maybe throw the knives at someone's head instead? Then they're incapacitated momentarily, but not reduced to a pile of rotting remains. Just food for thought."" 
 The L word is used pretty early on the book and it did take me somewhat by surprise. Though not in a bad way. I guess I'm either too old and cynical or have read so much urban fantasy now that I'm used to it being declared once at the end of a five book series. It wasn't a flippant use of the L word either. It was just there... and it was nice. I think it was kinda cool actually. 
 Cat 
 Cat and Bones are very protective over their respective turfs. Cat is not above a little ass grabbing to get her point across to other women and Bones threatens the crown jewels of every man who looks at his Kitten a second longer than they should. Aren't they sweet? 
 But back to the wonders of Bones. He spends the entire book trying to open Cat's mind to the creatures of the underworld. Explaining that not everything with fangs is evil and maybe not everyone she staked was the stone cold killer she thought they were. This makes her uncomfortable about herself and her small mindedness. I like that Ms. Frost used this as a plot device because many books in the same genre seem to skim over this or try and come up with some plenty complicated reasoning as to why their characters can get away with killing whoever they want. 
 Plus who wouldn't love a guy who dishes out a comeuppance to the idiot who wrecked your heart and tore your confidence to smithereens? Yeah - thought so... bring on the hottie with a body! (I got that from watching too many episodes of New Girl, I have a problem, please help me). 
 I think what draws the readers to Bones is the evident display of emotion that he feels. Not just for Cat, but for his friends and the victims they encounter. He's not above tearing up at the thought of his loved ones dying. Bones grabs a hold onto what he wants and lets that person know this - graphically. He communicates. And this ladies, we know is a quality worthy of King Solomon's mines, the contents of Bluebeards' forbidden room and finding out Who Framed Roger Rabbit combined. A sexy, alpha vampire who can communicate with words, not just grunts. Well, that's something that readers will come back to, over and over again. As well as the sexy times, they do have a lot of sexy times in this book. And! Bones did wait over two-hundred years for Cat. It makes sense that a person would want to share their appreciation of this fact. 
 To sum it all up. This book rocks like a Spice Girls reunion tour. Go Ginger! It's not the most well written book, it has Mary-Sues all over the darn place, the villains are sufficiently cheesy and evil and it kinda hero worships Buffy the Vampire Slayer. But it dug itself a place in my heart and will stay there for some time yet. Plus - I love the fact that Bones says the word telly. I haven't heard someone say that word in years - so cool. 
 Now I am in a quandary about whether to include this in either the paranormal or urban fantasy section of this blog. I think that urban fantasy fanatics might throw their unmentionables at me if I put this book in their sacred section. But that's what I'm going to do! Why? Because I have the gift of foresight and my spidey senses are telling me that in the future this Cat person is going to have a fun time kicking some serious ass. In leather. Which is urban fantasy rule numero uno. Kapow!

5,"Yet again the Animorphs prove to be incredible incompetent. I'm a little tired of them screwing up all the time, actually. When I was a kid I didn't question that they always made it out alive, but it's pretty nuts that they manage to survive this one. 
 This was also the episode where they nearly die in ant morph. It is a frequently referenced event throughout the series, and I appreciate as an adult how important it is that they introduce the notion of PTSD to this world. Animorphs deserves credit for not shirking from the horrible parts of war. In reading through the episode I was surprised how quickly the event was over. Since it's brought up again so often later in the series it grew in the lore as an important event. The actual ant battle lasts less than a page. 
 (view spoiler)[The main plot revolves around Ax's incredibly stupid, stupid plan to hijack a bug fighter. Of course it goes tits up immediately and they're all captured. Why Visser Three doesn't turn them all into controllers immediately is convenient, but I do appreciate that the kids are still really naive and inexperienced at this stage in the story. 
 This book is notable for revealing that Marco's mother is Visser One. It's a pretty sweet twist, it totally blew my mind when I was a kid, and I'm happy to say it was satisfying even now. In a book of coincidences, this one is one of the most forgivable, because it's such a dramatic turn. The joker of the group (who has so far been characterized as selfish and obnoxious) now has a personal stake in the game, and what's more, he decides to keep it a secret. It's the kind of juicy plot that makes me want to see this made into a tv series. (hide spoiler)] 
 Marco was always my favorite voice back in grade school, so it's fun to revisit the humor. I'm realized that he, along with Calvin of Calvin and Hobbes, was pretty influential in developing my sense of humor."
4,"The Big Friendly Giant is my favourite Roald Dahl book. An absolutely adorable tale of a giant from Giant Land who travels across the UK at night, blowing dreams into the windows of young children. It just happens that, one night, a young girl by the name of Sophie spots him. 
 And thus the adventures begin. Sophie helps The BFG overcome the torment and shame thrust upon him by his unfortunate bretheren (who like to eat small children! *gasp*), and a beautiful little friendship forms as a result. 
 This book is brilliant because it inspires all kinds of wonderful things in a child's imagination. It certainly left me wishing I could press my belly button and become invisible! :)"
5,"I'm just gonna.... 
 This book...so emotional! Shesh! 
 I freaking love Dee and Beck together! 
 Wow, not what I expected at all. I don't even! I can't! 
 (view spoiler)[I just was looking at Harper Sloan's pintrest and saw Zeke's...almost teared up! Whhhhy! It's been almost a week since I read this book... (hide spoiler)]"
2,"I told myself I'd hate it. They were never brilliant books to begin with (Yes, I realize they're YA. YA fiction can still be phenomenal), but there's been a steady decline in quality over the last few. 
 I wish I'd trusted my gut. 
 I've never been a fan of Patterson's style (AKA: slap-dash), but the plot content used to be worth trudging through the poor characterizations and ridiculous parenthetical asides (Do not have your story's narrator speak directly to the reader and refer to past books. Just do not). Now, I'm trying to remember what the plot was. 
 Oh, right, Max and the gang are supposed to save the world from certain destruction, as they have been for the past seven books. Cool. 
 Problem? I still know nothing as a reader. I'm all for keeping the suspense up, but I'm not really interested in having no knowledge about who's evil, who's not, and where in the hell we're headed. Jeb's evil. Okay, not so much anymore. Okay, now he is. Angel's a psycho. Nope, now she's Max's second-in-command. (view spoiler)[Surprise! Max's mom, the one lady we're supposed to trust, is probably in on the whole conspiracy. (hide spoiler)] 
 Dear author sir: you may fuck with me for one book. Maybe two. After seven, I'm well aware you just want my money. 
 (view spoiler)[I know I shouldn't comment on the Fang/Dylan debacle, because the readers' feelings are pretty clear, and if Patterson makes her end up with Dylan he's going to lose a lot of readers, but I just need to get my two cents in. 
 If Patterson wanted to introduce some sort of love triangle (Well, I guess with the introduction of Maya/Max II it's more than that, but you get the idea) to capitalize on, well, basically the Twilight fanbase, he maybe should have spoken to a teenage girl. I've always given him credit where credit is due for writing from the female perspective, but when a girl imagines her perfect guy, she doesn't automatically think of a male version of herself. 
 To put it bluntly, I would kill a male version of myself, not date him. If I met a guy who had the exact same thoughts as me and was able to finish all of my sentences, I would not swoon. He would grate on my nerves to no end. I just can't begin to understand the chemistry between two people who are supposed to have identical opinions on everything. 
 I won't even go into the absolutely ridiculous dissolution of her and Fang's relationship. If you read it, you know. (hide spoiler)] 
 I've been told there's only one more book, so I'll probably stick it out to the end, but this series comes across as Patterson's need to get in on the teen cash cow and nothing more. 
 Young adults deserve better."
3,"(Proof received for free, this does not affect my opinion.) After all that build-up in the previous installment, I was really hoping that this book would be back on the same level as the first book in his series. It wasn't. It started off promisingly though with the best kind of humor and a story that was a hell of a lot of fun to follow. But then things got complicated again and Ritter completely lost me at the big finale. Again. It wasn't necessarily bad, but all the fun from the first part got squished in record time. At this point I'm actually wondering if I'd ever recommend the series to anyone..."

 Reviewer: Jennifer 
 Recently kicked out of boarding school, Derek Fitzpatrick is forced to move back home with his 'ditzy' stepmother and her young son while his father serves in the Navy. Things get worse quick when his stepmother Brandi announces that not is she pregnant, but she is moving the family back to her home town of Chicago. 
 With nowhere else to go, he has no choice but to move in to Brandi's childhood home with her father and younger sister Ashtyn. But Ashtyn has too many things on her mind than to worry about Derek. The only girl on the Freemont High Rebel football team, it's the summer before her senior year and she has just been voted captain of the team. And while this should be the perfect start to her senior year, she can't shake the feeling of guilt that she 'stole' it from her teammate and boyfriend Landon. After dealing with an absentee mother and sister along with a neglectful father, Ash has major trust issues and feels like she can't take much more. But when Landon ditches the Rebels for their rivals, she has no choice but to trust Derek. 
 I was so excited to read this book and Simone definitely didn't let me down. Like all of her books there were so many things to love. Now up until about a month ago, I knew absolutely nothing about football. But the good thing about this book is that even though football plays a pretty big role. It's not overwhelming and even if you know nothing about the sport, you can still follow the story. The one thing I was disappointed about was that there was no epilogue. Maybe I just spoiled after reading the Perfect Chemistry series repeatedly over the last few years that I just expected there to be an epilogue that gave you a looking into Derek and Ashtyn's future. It was a little disappointing to read the entire book just for it to end, but that doesn't take away from the story. 
 I waited so long for this book that it's a little bitter sweet to be writing the review, and if that doesn't tell you how amazing this story is, I really have nothing else for you. Buy it, read it, love it. I did!!"
1,"I was expecting to like this one. You know, a lot of people say that they love Fangirl OR this one, it's one of them. I was hesitant to read it, but when I heard the backstory of Eleanor I thought that I will identify with her a lot with her and because of that will love it. So I jumped into it. 
 Honestly I really liked the beginning of the book, it was interesting, cute and I thought that it will continue like that, but after a while, I understood that nothing else really is going to happen. Meaning - there were no big moments that would take my breath away and I couldn't wait to know what will happen next. I wouldn't say that this book was predictable, I would say that I didn't really want to predict - I didn't care what will happen next. 
 The connection that I felt with the book was completely lost around the middle of it. Sadly it didn't come back, so I just pushed myself through it to make sure that it really doesn't get better.

3,"It was a fun page-turner, and I enjoyed reading it, but it was not great literature. Would be a good beach read."
4,"I loved almost everything about this book. I really enjoyed reading about Katsa, her grace, how she used her grace, but mostly how she was with Po and how she took care of Bitterblue. I love Po, he is strong, sensitive, loving, and would do anything for Katsa. Raffin is wonderful and I really wish there would be a novella or something so we can see what happens with him. I liked the drama, suspence, and action of this story. The thing I really did not like was that Katsa did not want to marry Po, not even the not wanting to marry part really but how it was constantly brought up, and how it was presented in the story it made her appear selfish. I don't know, it just bothered me, I didn't have to read about them getting married in the future but I guess I hoped that at least the chance would be there. I am going to read Bitterblue next, I really am not interested in reading Fire, I don't know what relevance that story has with the other two books so I am skipping it."
5,"Shortly after Georges (the s is silent, thank you) moves out of the house he's always lived in to an apartment building a few blocks away he meets the strange, but intriguing Safer, a self proclaimed spy. Safer is insistent that the man who lives in the apartment right above Georges is up to no good, and he has recruited Georges to help him spy on the man, ""Mr. X"", to try to catch him in the act, whatever that act may be. Safer asks Georges to do more and more risky things in the pursuit of the mission, and although Georges feels uncomfortable he complies, because Safer is his friend, and, between being bullied at school and his mother always being away at the hospital that she works at, the only friend he has these days. 
 I've heard the term ""unreliable narrator"" thrown around about this book, but I would argue that Georges' unreliability is it's strength. From the beginning it is apparent that there is something that Georges is leaving out, and it is his secret, as much as the Safer's secret that keeps the book moving with forward momentum. Could Georges' secret have been revealed at the beginning? Sure. Would the book have been as interesting? Maybe. Would Georges have been as strong of a character if he came out with it at the beginning? No. Georges denial is part of what makes him such a compelling character, and without Georges secret you have no ""liar &spy"". Great urban setting that doesn't focus on the gossip and intrigue of the wealthy, but the (somewhat) normal people that populate most urban centers. A good message about bullying without being hit you over the head preachy, and a nice instance of the bullied taking action in a sensible way."

 Full Review 
 Also posted on my blog and tumblr. 
 I read this right after finishing All The Bright Places, and though I really enjoyed it, I've got to say that I think I preferred My Heart and Other Black Holes. 
 Reading a book about suicide partners, you expect it to be depressing, possibly triggering, and really fucking sad, but something you don't expect it to be is hopeful. That was quite possibly my favourite part of this book: the hope it carried. With all the books I've read surrounding depression and suicide (though limited) have all been quite focused on the during, experiencing the depression, and than near the end, we find that glimmer of hope the character usually needs to hold on. My Heart and Other Black Holes didn't have a glimmer of hope, it had a fucking star. It was brilliant to say the least. As important as it is to show the varying effects depression has on people, it's as equally important to show that it can get better. This book tried to show that, that it can get better, and not to give up the good fight; and with that somewhat lacking in YA, it made my heart fucking sing. 
 This book gave me that feeling. That feeling you get in your chest when you're so overwhelmed by emotion that you don't have the capacity to explain how it feels. It gave me that, not just because of the intense subject matter discussed, but because of the hope it shone on mental health. That just because you are suffering from a mental illness doesn't mean it's the end; the end of your life or the end of you. This message is so incredibly important, and I can't thank Jasmine Wanga enough for putting these ideas onto paper. 
 Darling, darling Aysel. How can I explain how compelling I found her character? The answer is, I can't. But I'm sure as hell gonna try. Much like Finch, I found that Asyel encaptured what it meant to be a teen that was depressed. To have such a clear and accurate representation made me so ridiculously happy, that this is the most coherent I'm going to get. She asked so many questions that I'm sure most of us will end up asking in our lifetime, that I couldn't help but feel that I was just as desperate to find the answers as her. She had so many little quirks that I felt like I really knew her, her love of classical music and constant references to physics let me feeling that there was a depth to her character lacking in many teenage characters. She was sharp, witty and incredibly intelligent. I felt like a Mom cheering from the sidelines for the whole book because I just wanted her to triumph; to concur her depression, to feel priceless and enjoy the days she deserves. 
 Roman was equally precious and also needs to protected at all costs. He too encaptured the constant daily struggle of guilt, grief and depression. The guilt he feel was so poignant and written so well it felt as if I could feel it through the pages. You would think you that you wouldn't be able to comprehend the guilt that Roman feels, but the way it's written allows for the reader to catch a glimpse. 
 There seems to be this generalization that only girls can become depressed, which is a load of bullshit; and I was so happy that Wagna broke this stereotype, as well as making him a popular boy. Because you know, popular boys have nothing to be depressed or suicidal over (again, I call bullshit). Both of these characters were so on point I don't know what else to say other than that. Inarticulate, I know, but accurate of my feelings towards these characters. 
 The development of their relationship and Aysel and Roman themselves, was so beautiful to read. Even though they found each other through extreme means, it felt natural. (That probably makes no sense, but that's the way it felt). Despite it's beauty, I found the development of their relationship was a smidge too fast; as well as the transition from being ready to commit suicide, to then deciding you desperately want to live. I just wish there was more time focused on these aspects. 
 On a side note, I was so happy to see the role of parents in this novel, especially in concerns to getting help. Your parents care, they want to help you and don't want you to feel alone. I loved, loved, loved that this message was clear as bell in this book. Even if it's not your parents you are loved, you are not alone, and you deserve the help you need. I repeat, this cannot be said enough. 
 And finally, despite Aysel having these extreme circumstances, that is not the reason she wants to kill herself. As she says, depression is like this black slug living inside her, eating her from the inside out. It's a chemical imbalance that leads her to the conclusion that she should end her life. Now, you're probably wondering why this matters. I find that the stories of those who wish to commit suicide or are depressed due to intense situations, are the ones that are told more frequently. These stories are so, so important, but the stories of those who have come to this decision because their brain is wired a little differently are just as important. And unfortunately, I don't see them as often. That is why I felt it was important to bring it up. Way to go Wanga, you're awesome, high five. 
 A beautiful, and incredibly hopeful story that left me feeling all the feels and eagerly awaiting more from this author. As I said with All The Bright Places, please, please, please read it. It is so worth it."

 PLEASE NOTE: This review will contain spoilers for book 1. This series was previously published under the names Lovely Vicious (Now, Love Me Never) and Savage Delight (now Forget Me Always) Forget Me Always is fully revised and updated edition of the previous book. It got a new cover, and because I loved books 1 and 2 of the Lovely Vicious Series so much, I decided to re-read both Love Me Never and Forget Me Always. 
 If you are new to the series, please check out my review of Love Me Never first. 
 I love this series. I loved this series when book 2 was called, Savage Delight, and I loved this series in the reworked versions. Savage Delight is now called Forget me Always, and it picks up right after Love Me Never left off. You need to read the first book or you will be confused as heck in this book. Isis is still in the hospital dealing with her memory loss after the events at the end of book 1. It instantly transported me back to how devastated I felt at the end of the first book because of everything that had happened between Isis and Jack. 
 All of the your favorite characters are back in this second installment, plus we get to see a lot more of Sophia. She becomes a main character with secrets of her own. Secrets are the name of the game in the Lovely Vicious series. Everyone has them, I thought we found out most of them in the first book. So not the case! There were lots more coming to the surface in Forget Me Always. I didn't see some of them coming at all. 
 I so badly just wanted Isis and Jack to start off where they finally left off near the end of the first book, but they had a long way to go to get back to that. Plus there was the added complication of Sophia. I got the impression through the first book that she only liked Jack as a friend, but I started to see a whole new Sophia in this story. One that I wasn't sure how much I liked. I understand why she was how she was, but my perception of her changed. 
 The Lovely Vicious series is dark and wounded. These characters are so deeply flawed but they are able to find comfort in each other after all of these awful things happened. I loved that they each faced some of their fears in this book. And I loved how they stuck together. The ending was tragic and intense once again and it left us hanging, just like last time. I am so sad that there is only one book left in the trilogy, but I am so anxious to see how everything will wrap up. This is a really unique series. There is not anything quite like it out there that I have encountered. I love it.

5,"Ah. This book is full of big ideas and important things and is super interesting. My mind is always a little bit blown after finishing it. wow. I wish I could write out this deep and amazing review about how great it is, but I don't have the brainpower right now. It's a great book, even if sci-fi isn't your thing (and it usually isn't mine). An interesting and compelling, if a bit scary, image of our future. An interesting look at human nature, the nature of genius, video games, special awareness (those no gravity battle scenes make my brain work in interesting ways), and a splendid example of amazing world-building. 
 ......September 25, 2010............ 
 I am so glad I had to do a dystopia book report, because if I didn't, I probably wouldn't have read this book. And it was amazing!! I won't say it didn't freak me out a little bit, with them putting a sixyear old kid through this. But I think this a great book for anyone who feels like kids aren't given enough credit, or anyone who thinks of military leaders as heartless monsters, or anyone who wishes there wasn't any war."
5,"I received a digital copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. I am in no way compensated for my opinions. 
 I really, really enjoyed this book. Let's break it down. 
 The first awesome thing about The Kiss of Deception is that it's successfully written from three different points of view (and at one point, four points of view). Also, it's in first person, but for once, it was necessary for it to be this way. 
 The story starts out with Princess Lia on her wedding day. She marrying a prince she's never met to forge an alliance between two kingdoms. Lia, however, has other plans and escapes the kingdom along with one of her ladies before the wedding happens. They travel to a distant town and start new lives working in a tavern. 
 What Lia doesn't know is that there's two people following her, the prince she left behind and an assassin. Both boys show up in the new town on the same night. 
 Here's where the first person becomes so important. At the top of every chapter (except the ones written from Lia's point of view), we get a name or a title. So either Rafe, Kaden, The Assassin, or The Prince. Because it's written in first person, you don't know who is the prince and who is the assassin. I found this twist SO GENIUS. So while Lia is falling in love with one or both of these boys, the reader isn't really sure who is who. Maybe they speculate. Maybe they're right...but then again, maybe they're wrong. The only other thing I'm going to say on this point is read carefully, the author drops lots of clues, but the surprise is so worth it. 
 I liked Lia as a character. She was a princess, but not afraid to get dirty and work hard. She also wasn't afraid to stand up for what she believed in and recognize her own flaws. There's a particular scene near the end of the book where she kills a horse to save a child from having to do it himself. The characterization of Lia in this scene was so spot on. It gave me ridiculous amounts of respect for her. 
 Of course, then there's the boys. I can't speak too much about them or it'll be too spoilery, but I'll give a few juicy tidbits. 
 The competition between the two boys is amusing and downright hilarious at some points. While one is clearly winning through most of the story, the different points of view leave the reader wondering if he's really the person Lia's supposed to be with. 
 Kaden is very much the quiet, pensive type. He has a lot going on behind his eyes, a past that molds him into the type of person he is. He always seems gentle, but surprised when people show him kindness. 
 Rafe is boisterous and sure of himself. He's kind, but he has secrets of his own that he can't let Lia find out. 
 The setting of the story is rich with history and local color. The author did a great job of rooting me in all the different places and cultures. I liked the languages and the way the history wove itself through the story without being overbearing. It was like solving a puzzle little by little, which is the most rewarding type of reading, I think, and even better because I was still surprised in the end. The characters are dynamic, multifaceted, and a constant surprise as the story progresses. I found myself relating to the characters, even when they did things I didn't agree with. 
 Artfully crafted, with twists and turns that kept me up at night, The Kiss of Deception will delight fans of Graceling by Kristin Cashore and Witchstruck by Victoria Lamb. 
 The only disappointment I had from The Kiss of Deception, was when I reached the end. Thank god it's a series. I need the second book NOW!"

 Anyone who loves Greek mythology read this. Read it now. ;_;"
0,"So far I have very mixed feelings about this one. I like the strong heroine, and I love the idea of all these different mythologies coming together, but it isn't as good as it should have been so far. 
 The writing is so-so, with some good descriptions, but mostly pretty redundant and slow. You don't get a good feel for how the characters look except that one is Egyptian, one is Japanese, etc. That's basically their personalities: their ethnicity. 
 The only reason I know one of them is a 'surfer boy' is because all the other characters keep telling you that. That's just lazy writing. 
 I think the characters need to be developed better. 
 I had such high hopes for this book because the heroine was a person of color. But those hopes are turning out to be false. o_O 
 And to be fair, I'm only about halfway through the book, so it could pick up. But so far, it's kinda hard to keep reading...."
4,"Beauty and the beast? Not quite, but Clay, the hero, is a retired male model and movie ""butt double"" while Charlie is a female firefighter, much-too-conscious of her large and ungainly build in comparison to her ballet-dancer mother. 
 There are other factors complicating their relationship - his family and his business plans, her past and her mother. But, overall, it's a pretty sweet and straightforward relationship developing between two interesting and attracted individuals. For a romance where conflict is limited (although it does flare up big time at a crisis point in their relationship), this is a sweet and sexy contemporary read worth checking out, also setting up the fourth and final Stryker family story in the ""Fool's Gold"" series (this last involves Evie, the younger sister of the three brothers)."
4,Loved this!!! So cute and actually kinda scary. Could not put it down!

 http://gravetells.com/paranormal-roma... 
 You know that scene from the reboot Star Trek movie where Scottie says ""I like this ship. It's exciting!""? Well that's how I felt while reading this book. Blind Faith is most definitely exciting! The story has a lot of elements of romantic suspense and flirts a little with the genre boundary, but I'd say it ultimately falls on the side of contemporary romance with some paranormal elements. 
 Speaking of ultimate, the Gray/Dean brothers are a hell of a set of alpha heroes! Nathan--like his brothers before him--is serious and radiates a constant lethal edge, and he's willing to sacrifice anything to see his family safe, with the freedom to live long, happy lives. That is, until Audrey dances back into his life. As the daughter of the psychopathic genius scientist who created the brothers to be the ultimate killer soldiers, Audrey must constantly walk the line between trying to live up to her mother's expectations and falling into the manipulations and mind games the twisted scientist thrives on. Both Nate and Audrey have one regret in life and that's losing each other, so to see them come back together after all this time is an intensely satisfying experience. 
 The story Ms. Zanetti has crafted is stellar, with great action and suspense, believable bursts of adrenaline followed by lulls of quiet. Some of the tactics used by the Dean brothers to communicate and infiltrate are quite brilliant and Audrey herself is far more capable and intelligent than she gives herself credit for. My favorite kind of heroine: determined and smart. 
 I love the sneak peek at the end of the book for the next book in the series and can't wait for it to come out. 
 There were several moments in Blind Faith that made me feel like I was in the middle of a Dan Brown novel, which really made me smile. Ms. Zanetti infuses such energy into the story, sprinkled with a nicely crafted cultish mystery, that it's really just a joy to read. Toss in the (possibly) unintentional comedic relief of the Dean brothers at their most protective with the expertly penned fighting sequences, and you've got a book that is nearly impossible to put down! 
 Blind Faith is #3 in the Sins Brothers series, so if you haven't read the first two, get started with Forgotten Sins. Check out GT's reviews for Forgotten Sins and Sweet Revenge!

3,"This was an interesting book, but I didn't enjoy it as much as PopCo. It dealt with a lot of complex issues in a fairly accessible way, but I found a lot of the characterisation quite flat. For example I found there were a lot of details left out of the main characters main love interest, things were alluded to but never explored. Eventually I found this frustrating. 
 I would recommend this book to people that enjoy fantasy reads and I can imagine that there are people who would enjoy it. It just wasn't everything I expected of it having enjoyed PopCo so much."
4,"There are some rough edges in the world building, but it's a small price to pay for something this original and interesting. I can't really think of a similar book, which might be the best recommendation of all."
5,"***I received this book for free from Nina Bocci PR in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review, which was originally posted on book blog Will Read for Feels. 
 Hooboy. I don't think there's been an author I've read all year who's made me want to eat my feelings quite as thoroughly as Sarina Bowen with her True North series. And I say ""eat my feelings"" because she delivers only a slightly smaller case of the eats as she does the feels. Keepsake, the third in the series featuring the Shipley family and their Vermont apple orchard, is no different. In fact, if book one was sweet as an apple pie and book two had the bitterness of cider apples, then book three had a tartness, that sharpness that makes you gasp, that leaves your mouth tingling, that sometimes gets strong enough to bring tears to your eyes, that leaves your lips puckering--in defense or for a kiss, who knows? 
 Let me start this review by saying that I love Zach to bits. He's easy to blush and easy on the eyes, and he's got a heart as wide as the world. The way he's been raised is just criminal; the way people who should've loved and cared for him mistreated him just brings out all sorts of anger and sadness. Yet he's pushed through it, and he remains true to himself and to his faith; more than that, he's kindness personified. I can understand why the younger Shipley sister has a monstrous crush on him. 
 Most of the above, however, I already knew going in, thanks to the fact that I'd gotten to know Zach over the past two novels in this series. The unknown entity here was heroine Lark, who has come to the Shipley farm to lick her wounds after having been through a traumatic experience while working for a nonprofit organization in South America. But she immediately intrigued me because it was clear she was a fighter. On the surface, there was the Lark who joked around with the family, who saw beyond the walls Zach didn't even know he'd erected, who fell for him because, well, who wouldn't? Below that was the Lark who was desperately trying to keep the bleeding pieces of herself from falling apart, who hated letting Zach help her even as she fell in love with him, who wanted to be better without knowing how. 
 Because I found myself a page-turning witness to this side of Lark, it made me see what lay beyond Zach's surface as well. The result is that I wanted this couple to succeed in a way that was almost palpable. But I know about brokenness inside, and I know about emotional crutches, and I knew that the road for Zach and Lark would be long, filled with potholes, and uphill virtually all the way. I even knew ahead of time some of the things that would have to be done to get them to a point where they could be what they needed for each other and help each other both grow and heal. It was a painful journey, and my heart hurt for them every step of the way. So I found myself grinning idiotically when I finally got that HEA that was such a long time in coming. 
 This was a terribly cathartic, yet completely worthwhile read for me. 
 And if the feels aren't sufficient to convince you to dive into this book, what makes it even more interesting intellectually is the way the two main characters of this book are set up. Let's face it: our typical romance hero is tall, built, and handsome, all of which Zach is, yes, but also brooding, likely a few years older than the heroine, definitely way more experienced sexually than she is, and richer or at least more financially independent. Zachariah is quiet without being brooding, slightly younger than Lark, a virgin, and has only started to save up from the work he does after coming to town with literally nothing but the clothes on his back--not even the shoes on his feet. Lark, in contrast, lived up her college life and wasn't shy about it; she's from a well-off family, and she's fairly worldly. So this book is a bit of a trope bender. 
 But the truth is, what makes Keepsake a whole lot of win has nothing to do with tropes or the kinds of characterization you'd put on a book report. It has to do with the idea that love can come at any point in your life, maybe at a point where you're not ready to be the person your lover needs you to be, and maybe at a point where your lover isn't ready to take the love you're offering. It has to do with the idea that love has the strength to outlast pain, that love is strong enough to let you take a step back because your partner needs to be alone--more, that it is strong enough to let you step away because your partner needs to journey on alone, whether or not you'll be meeting again on the other side. This is a love story that bears none of the illusions that things should be perfect between lovers, that in fact operates on the premise that at some point, they will hurt one another. But it also persists with the hope that they'll also heal one another. 
 It's a beautiful thing. This is a beautiful story. That's what I have to say about it, essentially. 
 I can't wait to learn more about the Shipleys and the people they care about, but this may well be my favorite book of the series. But for now, I'm going to shut up and fantasize about apple pie and cider. 
 Right after I tell you this: READ IT."
2,"I dragged this book for so long that when I reread it, it totally didn't capture my interest. I personally think that the main female lead just put me off completely by not continuing this story. There were so many that I didn't get and just annoyed me as to her being in that situation, I just am peeved about it. 
 It's great for others but just not for me."
3,"3.5 stars. Fascinating, and not something I would have picked up if it hadn't been required reading. I did feel that most of the subplots were weak in comparison to the main plot, and that a a few of them were unnecessary, but the strong ending made up for that."
5,"This is my first book by Renee Carlino. If her other books are half as good as Before We Were Strangers, it certainly won't be my last. 
 Before We Were Strangers is a wonderful, lovely, heartbreaking, satisfying, emotional, perfect second chance romance. I couldn't have asked for a better book. The writing style was perfection, the characters were real and loveable, and the story was interesting and unique. 
 I fell in love with both Matt and Grace. These two characters were absolutely wonderful. They felt like real people with depth. I felt like I was reading about two people I intimately knew. It was easy to slip into Matt or Grace's character and truly feel and understand them. That's exactly what I look for when reading a book like this. 
 As for the actual story line, it was fantastic. It was an emotional roller coaster full of highs and lows and I felt each one deeply. Those highs were so sweet and perfect while those lows made my heart ache. It all felt very authentic, though. 
 I almost feel like I should have something more negative to say about this book (all I've done is rave!), but the truth is I just don't. Before We Were Strangers was such a good book and deserves all the praise it gets.

4,"In the second installment of The Dresden Files we learn a bit more about what lies within Harry Dresden and just how he ticks. There's action and it's quite entertaining, however, it made me feel our main character is a bit on the oversensitive side, despite routing for chivalry (or is it chauvinism?) and old world ways. 
 While it may not be the best writing, it is certainly not the worst, and worth the read. It's the story, more than the writing, that gives it it's worth and the extra star. If you felt the first book was not a waste of time, dive into the second one head first, and enjoy the ride."
5,"FIRST I WAS AFAID, I WAS PETRIFIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDD... 
 Third book, okay? and it was just as awesome as the other two. EVEN THE EPILOGUE WAS UTTERLY PERFECT. 
 I cant believe it. I cried. I laughed. I was in shock. This book is full os passion, war, torment and its so human and so perfect. 
 Day and June are amazing characters, and their development throughout the book was flawless. There was not a moment in any of the three books where i was bored or not interested. 
 I was worried with the epilogue, i didnt want it to be like Mockingjay. But it surprised me how well the story closed up and the circle was complete. Im so happy i read this trilogy. 
 I really dont know what to say. Im honestly overwhelmed with all of this. I hope theres a story after champion... or at least a short story. 
 Marie Lu please make it happen. 
 And if you havent read this trilogy.. i dont know, man, stop everything and start reading asap."
4,"He had almost lost his soul, and the scar would serve to remind him of the fragility of will, and the difficulty of goodness. 
 City of Lost Souls tugged at my heartstrings. The Epilogue both killed me and made my heart beat again. What goes down between Magnus and Alec is heartbreaking. Brother Zachariah's appearance made the epilogue better, but I am still left wanting more. 
 Luckily City of Heavenly Fire is beckoning me from atop my bookshelf. So I will devour the last book of TMI and hope for the best. Happy reading, everybody! Have a great weekend ^ ^"
2,"Bob Howard works at The Laundry, a secret arm of the British government that monitors magic, super-science and otherworldly intelligences. 
 I so wanted to like this book. While I find H.P. Lovecraft himself too purple, the mythology he began was amazing and I like the idea of combining it with modern science and sensibilities. But Stross loves exposition just a little too much; he's like Tom Clancy but with magic formulas instead of spy satellites. 
 At first, I found the paragraphs-long information dumps distracting, then annoying and finally I just couldn't get past them. I was bored and I didn't care about the fairly intriguing main character any longer."
2,"Couldn't keep going on this book. I tried. Maybe I'll pick it up again one day. I think this is one to read on paper, not listen through audio, so you can skim read the boring bits..."
4,"(Tiny spoiler alert) This was a surprisingly moving story of a marriage. A couple with two children are struggling in their marriage, when at the worst possible time the wife is called up to active duty and sent to Iraq. At home with their two daughters, trying to keep the home running smoothly, the husband makes an effort to understand why his wife had to go and what it meant to her to be a soldier and finds that he still loves his wife very much. Meanwhile, she is going through struggles of her own, deep seated fears of abandonment, as well as the war and the daily trauma that brings. Tragedy strikes and she has to find a way to live with the injuries she sustains and the things she's seen in war and her husband has to convince her that he loves her and wants to be with her no matter what."
3,"I don't know why but every single part of this book reminds me of Fifty Shades. But I did enjoy the book, it was entertaining. Oh hell, I stayed up to finish this book. It was totally a page turner because I was craving for more Gideon. I am so disappointed in Cary though cos I liked him at first. But he fucked up, big time and he hurt Eva when he was supposed to be the good bestfriend."
5,"This review may contain spoiler if you haven't read the last book.

 Now the ""kissing"" rule is out, all the boys are getting their first kiss with Sang. If you've read the last book you would know how, and when Sang's first kiss happened. Since that has been on the boys' mind, thus it's really only matter of time that Sang has her first kiss with all the boys. I thought the way these kisses happened were very sweet, a couple were a little intense, because the long build-up and high anticipation. 
 What I really like is how the series progress in a fairly steady pace, which means the story and characters have plenty of time to develop. I am very happy with how Ms Stone have managed to move forward with Sang's relationship with each of the boys, while at the same time to not making the situation awkward. Now we are at book 7, I feel Sang really came a long way. Sang is no longer timid and easily intimated, she is slowly building up her confidence, learning who she is, and who she wants to be. 
 Overall, I thought the story plot of House of Koraba was alright. I felt this book was more like a bridge for the series onward from all the school dramas. I thought the bomb threats scenario was getting repetitive, and nothing really major has happened in this book, except maybe we are getting closer to finding out who this ""V"" guy is. What I enjoyed the most from House of Koraba, was the continue relationship-building for the boys and Sang. I just can't get enough of this series, sure it's little unusual (nine boys and one gal) but I really enjoy the nontraditional romance, the author's writing style, and the intriguing characters (academy boys), it's really addicitve! 
 Happy Reading!! XO"
3,"I'm sure you have heard it said that appearance does not matter so much, and that it is what's on the inside that counts. This is, of course, utter nonsense, because if it were true then people who were good on this inside would would never have to comb their hair or take a bath, and the whole world would smell even worse than it already does. 
 Finally finished this one at work today."
3,"I did enjoy this, the new location is fun and Hugh is exactly as insane as I would have imagined him but... I really hated the relationship drama. It seemed like Kate was supposed to show how much she cared for and trusted Curran by letting him treat her like shit while he gets to be angry the second any guy flirts with her/stands to close/looks at her and then it's her responsibility to calm him down and pacify him. He gets to do what he wants and Kate has to suck it up but she has to act in a particular manner or he gets upset. It's just totally unfair and really manipulative, she's trying to learn to be part of his world but the rules keep changing around her."
3,"3 out of 5 Stars for Mayson-brother #2 
 Trevor Mayson never believed in love at first sight - the curse that supposedly runs in the Mayson family. He's a player and intends to stay that way. However, one night, things took the wrong turn with his best friend Liz Hayes, after which Trevor dumped her, wanted nothing to do with her anymore. 
 Except that as soon as Liz decides to move on, Trevor regrets his actions and decides to do everything that's in his power to win her back. However, he will have to help Lilly get over a certain number of insecurities and challenges. 
 Until Trevor is the second instalment of the Until Series by Aurora Rose Reynolds, and tells Trevor's story, one of the 4 Mayson brothers. I liked the first book, Until November, even though I didn't give it more than 3 stars because I found it a bit far-fetched in terms of the story. It was however an enjoyable read because it evolved around love, family, alpha-male behaviour, steamy scenes and pregnancy - in other words: it's the ideal book to read when you want to relax. 
 And unfortunately, I felt like Until Trevor was just a total copy of Until November. It's exactly the same scheme: 
 1)Manwhore meets girl and falls head over heels (doesn't even think about other women and is totally cured from his player-ways) 
 Did I mention manwhore has great body and is tattooed? And has a filthy mouth. Oh my! 
 2)Girl is reluctant to engage - although who are we kidding? She can't wait to give in! 
 3)Boy is a control-freak and alpha-male. Boy talks girl into moving in, buying a puppy etc. 
 4)Girl has issues from the past she has to deal with, so boy helps her with that 
 5)HEA - marriage, sex, babies etc. 
 Sorry to break it down for you in such spoilerish ways, but that's what reading Until November is like, reading Until Trevor is certainly no different, except for the names and Liz's family story. Trevor and Ash (from Until November) feel like one and the same person and do not really have such a different personality. I would have wished for them to be different - more unique. 
 The good thing is that compared to Until November, Until Trevor holds a lot less grammatical and editing errors (although you can still find some). 
 Anyway, it's difficult for me to rate this book because on the one hand I am really disappointed that the author went on a copycat path (at least she's copycatting her own work, huh?) and that book 1 and 2 hold sooo much similarities, but on the other hand I can't help but admit that I liked reading this, even if it was so predictable - because it still held a few elements that were different. And I probably also like Aurora Rose Reynolds' story-telling and writing. I love a good dual-pov, and enjoy it even more when there are no editing errors. 
 So in the end, if you are not too selective and do not have a high bar in terms of standards, I would definitely recommend this as a light, sexy and relaxing read."
5,"i absolutely loved this story. the only bad thing i can say about it is it's a little plot-heavy at times, but i think that's typical of the fantasy genre. and i loved LOVED that there were so many complex female characters showing different kinds of strength, and of course i loved how badass the protagonist Katsa was. and i totally fell in love with Po and shipped the two of them early on and literally squealed with delight when the ship started sailing. READING THIS BOOK WAS DELIGHTFUL, I TELL YOU! DELIGHTFUL! yes it's a bit of an unbelievable hero's journey, but WHO CARES?! that's what fantasy is for!! and i cheered for all of Katsa's victories and legitimately dreaded potentially bad outcomes (see my sister's snapchat for proof, i sent her lots of emotional selfies in varying states of elation and despair as i made my way through most of the chapters in the last two days). KATSA JUST HAS SO MUCH AGENCY AND I LOVE IT! i mean any book that starts with a section titled ""the lady killer"" that is not about a smary pick-up artist but an actual literal lady who is a killer...i would read. and you should too. it's fan-freakin-tastic. 
 series prediction: Giddon becomes a villain, maybe. 
 series question: how do you pronounce Lienid? 
 i'm off to search for fanart!"
4,"Cassie Palmer fans have been waiting an age for a resolution to the cliffhanger from Hunt the Moon. If the years have dulled your memory, Pritkin saved Cassie's life by using his forbidden demonic powers and was promptly whisked back to hell by his dear old dad for breaking the rules. Well, I'll tell you this, we get the rescue mission we've been waiting for, but don't expect to be satisfied. This book ends with a cliffhanger just as gnarly as the last one. The story kept me glued to the pages, then made me want to poke my eyes out at the very end. Karen Chance is killing me. 
 The book picks up just a few days after the events of the last installment. Cassie is bent on rescuing Pritkin, but knows it's going to take more power and know-how than she's got. So she crafts a plan to go back in time to find her mom in the hopes that the goddess can help her craft a rescue plan. Unfortunately, that proves to be almost as difficult as the trip to hell. Cassie must navigate through time and roadblocks in her own past just to start her journey. And once she figures out what to do, her trip into the underworld is fraught with danger and betrayal. Pritkin's dad won't give him up willingly, and Cassie's power is acting wonky. It's a cluster from beginning to end that Cassie can barely make it through alive. 
 The odds are against Cassie at every turn, but she never gives up. Her single-minded focus to save Pritkin never wavers. How she can't realize she is in love with him is completely beyond me. As for Mircea, he's around... sort of. But he exists solely in the overwhelming shadow of Pritkin. You can really almost forget he's part of the bigger picture. Or at least, I did, because all I cared about was finally reuniting Cassie and her war mage... about getting him back into her world. That's the whole book: the mission. It's action, action, action, with a dash of emotion and origin story. So much is happening. Poor Cassie never seems to catch a break, never seems to get a breather. I had hoped we would have more relationship progression, but there is so much external stuff, there is little room for internal. That is, perhaps, my only complaint, other than the ending. 
 I was absolutely riveted. Then, about 95% into the book, the floor dropped out from under me, and what followed was a barrage of anger, disbelief, confusion, frustration... and then it was over. I absolutely will not spoil what happens, but I will say it will leave you counting the days, months, years? until the next book comes out.

4,I've been binge reading NA novels to kick off the summer. I really liked Foreplay. I thought it was sweet. Some cringe-able moments but I liked Pepper and seeing where things went.
4,"Huh. 
 I liked that. 
 The end was sad, though. 
 It held my attention well, I read it in around 4 blocks and felt a bit lost when it was over, although the bit at the end does a good job of bringing the end down. 
 Some of the names were confusing, I never did get my head pronouncing Idiran properly, but that was ok, the names were each unique enough it didn't matter. 
 Yeah, I liked that, I'll read his other books now I think. Although maybe not right away."
3,"I had heard some really good things about this book so I couldn't wait to start reading it. Some of the reviews I follow gave this book great reviews, especially when they marked it as a cute comedy. While the story and characters were cute and funny, this book didn't ever make me laugh out loud like I'd hoped it would. The plot was fairly simple with some nice action scenes and quirky comments. I would've liked more from the villain. I felt she was a little cheesy but other than that it was a very light-hearted story with some deaths that didn't even feel saddening. For what the book is trying to do I think that's a good thing but for myself I do like some good angst here and there. While the writing wasn't the best I've ever read, I enjoyed the story and all of the characters but I was able to put it down and it took me longer to read than I would've liked normally. There was more language in this book that I would've expected for how light the tone was, but nothing too offensive was said and there were no bedroom scenes. I think everyone would enjoy this book as a light read."
5,"Oryx & Crake was the most gripping stream-of-consciousness story I've read. It weaves between the present (a lush apocalyptic version of our world, overrun with genetically modified animals and a small population of a new humanoid species) and the past (how all of this came to be), which is still set far into the future of our world today. 
 The complexity of the narrative is impressive, and Atwood structures it beautifully. The world-building is equally detailed and intriguing. 
 Filled with stark emotion and a bittersweet exploration of human nature, our interactions with each other and with our world, Oryx & Crake is a striking story that will draw you in and keep you entranced."
5,"Beautiful! Wonderful! Amazing! 
 God, I love this trilogy so much

3,Review to come!
5,"** spoiler alert ** 
 What a great ending...at first I was all for JP and Mia getting together. I liked how Mia had moved away from Lilly because Lilly always got on my nerves. And it felt more realistic that Mia and Michael didn't have smooth sailing - that's life! But in the end everything worked out as it should :) What a great series!"
4,"I quite enjoyed this read. I didn't especially like the reason Maya undertook the year-long experiment (to become popular) but I think with everything that she went through she came out the end of it as a more compassionate and kind person. Just goes to show you, that some advice just never goes out of style!"
4,Does Vaughan brain on unicorns and fairies..? Incredibly creative!
5,"The only reason I had to put down this book during the four days I spent reading it was because of exams. Other than that, it was purely addictive and I couldn't stop reading. There are huge similarities between it and The Hunger Games which leads me to wonder about where Collins got her inspiration from. I enjoyed both stories but I thought this one was way more brutal and scary, partly because it felt more realistic. It was still awesome though."
5,"** spoiler alert ** 
 This was a pretty interesting read, Meyer captured my interest enough to make me request the remainder of the series from the local library. I had Cinder's real identity figured out after about 100 pages or so, which was the only let down. Although I give Meyer credit for not pulling it out of nowhere, either."
4,Sassy! Punchy! Funny! Short! Recommended!
4,"As I said in my Torn Hearts review, I would have loved to have the novella included in the book so we could get less unecessary scenes and a lot more of background. I loved Jensen and Mia and Olivia too (if that's her name cause my memory already run short). I don't think it was realistic but it was cute nonetheless although really, really, really cliche. Mia was so funny and amazing, I loved having her as the protagonist because she didn't seem very interesting in Kaleidoscope Hearts so the author made a great choice by exploring her story for another book. 
 Again, the moments with the old crew: Elle, Oliver and Victor were amazing."
5,"Another Debut novel that I enjoyed immensely. And it's based in the South again -1960s. As a whole, the story isn't as funny as I had first presumed it would be but that didn't take away from the story and there are some clearly funny parts. The beginning is mostly Cecilia with her insane (literally) mother but once her mother dies, Ceecee is in Savannah with her great aunt. The plot is basically how she comes into her own getting past the hurt. It's very character driven, the character being Cecilia Honeycutt. 
 I loved seeing the world through Ceecee's point of view. She is realistic and loving though she is scared and hurt by her life with her mother. Hands down she is my favorite character in the book, which is a good thing since she is the main character. And the other characters are so well developed that I could imagine Savannah with them quite easily. They are wise, funny, flawed, and caring; with different degrees of each trait for every character. 
 The description of Savannah is fantastic -tons of flowers and trees. Living in the rich part of town Ceecee is in a different world of woman, gardens, history, and heart. Loved the world of women. Men show up every once in a while but it's mostly just women as the main focus. The dad is paid the most attention to as a male character and he shows up only a handful of times. 
 After finishing the book I can see why is it for adults, the N-word is in there but other than that it could be read by a younger audience. I don't know if they would be as interested but it is a wonderful story that ends on a bright note. Ceecee becomes the girl she had always wanted to be. By the end of the book Ceecee is quite popular. It couldn't have happened to a better girl."
3,"Why I picked it up: I was intrigued by the band road trip element. 
 Colby and his best friend since the age of 9 Bev have had a plan for after graduation for years: tour for a week with Bev's girl band, then go to Europe for year and see everything. No college, no SATs, just travel. On the first day of the road trip with the band, Bev reveals that she isn't going to Europe and she is going to college. For Colby, this is the ultimate betrayal--to apply and get recommendations and write essays, Bev must have known for months, yet she never told him. He wants to go home, but the band has gigs booked to the road trip continues. 
 I liked it. It was much deeper than I expected, and I really liked some of the side characters. The side plot about the tattoo from Colby's dad's band's album cover I found to be particularly cool. And I really liked the note to the bike owners in Portland. 3 1/2 stars.

3,"This book was pretty good. I loved how it takes place in England during the 12th century. Very fascinating, especially since the doctor investigating the murder is a woman."
3,"The first 75% of this novel I would give 10 stars to. How Not To Fall is about Annie Coffey who is completely having A Thing for Dr. Charles Douglas. Dr. Charles is a professor who works in the same lab as Annie. Annie is nearly finished with her bachelors degree and will soon leave for a graduate program. Over time a relationship develops between the two as Dr. Charles helps Annie with her mock dissertation however Dr. Charles decides to put it on hold for a short while until Annie has graduated. He's very serious about wanting to get rid of their unequal power dynamics. They have important conversations about consent, contraception, their past sexual experiences, and what each other likes and doesn't like. The snarky, nerdy, tension-filled conversations are great. The wait doesn't last for long and then it just perfectly captures that manic infatuation with each other's bodies that comes with a budding relationship. The plot just turns into straight erotica but the writing is still A+++. There are some ridiculous new adult tropes here such as Annie is initially a virgin but she suddenly becomes a sex expert in very little time and there's no awkwardness or discomfort. There's a few other quibbles I have about the story but in general the writing and great dialogue had me hooked. 
 However..... around 75% into this book it sort of randomly out of nowhere turns into every bad new adult/Fifty Shades of Grey wannabe cliche. Dr. Charles is English and it's revealed that he's part of the minor nobility. He's hinted previously at a troubled childhood but suddenly it's ""I'm so broken you cannot fix me. I will turn into my abusive father because it is fate and I must leave you."" There's also this weird usage of calling Dr. Charles' mental trauma as ""The Monster"", capital letters included. Suddenly these very smart and rational people are seriously discussing ""The Monster"" as though Charles has this caged animal inside that he cannot control and cannot be fixed or cured. How Not To Fall had so much promise to be one of the best new adult type books I've read. The author could have easily used some other form of tension to introduce into the story without falling into a trope or cliche. I also feel like the author could have used mental trauma and mental health less as a plot device to separate the characters and instead had the characters seriously discuss these issues over time similarly to how many other topics are brought up in this book. It's just so disappointing. I would definitely read more by the author as the majority of this book was so excellent but I have somewhat lowered expectations."
3,"An honest and creative look into spiraling depression and the road to recovery--described in such an authentic, simplified way, despite the fact that putting those feelings into words can seem impossible. The first half was wonderful. The second half, while still managing moments of brilliance, lacked some of the heart of the first half. Scenes of blatant transphobia and sexism soured what was otherwise a really great book."
5,"As seen on The Quiet Concert 
 DID I LOVE THIS BOOK OR WHAT? I want to display it on my bookshelf on a raised platform with a spotlight and queue up harmonic music every time someone gazes upon it. I want to snuggle with it at night and fall peacefully asleep to thoughts of Xander. I want to rewind my life and replay the few precious moments spent reading this on loop. 
 Alright, maybe I am getting carried away. But seriously, I devoured this book. This is definitely one of my new favorite light-contemporaries, in the distinguished company of My Life Next Door. If you have ever had so much as a passing thought about reading contemporary, you should pick up this book right now. 
 Kasie West, can we be besties? I seriously love your work. 
 The best thing about this book? Besides Caymen and Xander and Xander and Caymen (and Caymen's grandfather) has to be the humor! Caymen is the queen of sarcasm and was absolutely hilarious! And her jokes were usually at Xander's expense, which - hello! - makes them a bazillion times funnier. Here are some of the things she said that made me laugh: 
 ""In the world of science, if Skye were a host, I would be her parasite. She has a life. I pretend it's mine."" 
 ""'Tomorrow is Saturday. Don't you have a tennis match to watch or something?' 
 'What? No. I hate tennis.' 
 I look around. 'You might want to keep your voice down when you say stuff like that. You wouldn't want to be kicked out of the club.'"" 
 ""'And since we're all into this matching up the career day to our traits I guess I should find a career for you that involves ironing T-shirts or using lots of hair product.'"" 
 ""I am not in denial. Okay, so I'm totally in denial, but I need her to play along with me until all the feelings I am trying to convince myself I have are actually true."" 
 ""'You think I can blackmail him? Show up at his work screaming, 'Daddy'? Like Will Ferrell in Elf?' 'Caymen, joking about it isn't going to help either of us feel better.' 
 'Elf is no joking matter. That movie is a classic.'"" 
 And can we give a shout out to the long lost grandfather here? When you put an old man in your book and make him funny - you get bonus points from me. 
 ""'Hi, I'm stranger one and this is stranger two. Are you uncomfortable yet?'"" 
 Caymen and Xander were pretty fantastic as separate entities - but together? - absolutely, perfect !This was the type of romance story where both parties are obviously interested in each other, but due to several misconceptions and no one speaking up about it, it's not acted upon. That means you have your 'AWW' moments, your 'Grrr' moments, your 'UGHHHH' moments, and your ')(*&@#$)(' moments, many times over before you finally get your '!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!' moment. And I enjoyed every damn second of it. 
 So we have a winning romance here, but that's obviously not all. This is Kasie West we are talking about so obviously this book goes deeper. We tackle some stereotypes and resolve some family issues. But really who cares about that when you have Caymen and Xander and Xander and Caymen (and Caymen's grandfather). They could have watched paint dry for 300 pages and I'd probably still be writing a glowing review. 
 Right so I hated this book. (That was a test to see if you were paying attention). I was in exactly the right mood for it and it was beyond enjoyable and funny. If I haven't convinced you to read it yet, then you must have no soul (kidding!)."
4,Review when I get home. :)
4,"Continuing my trend of reading books by awesome, funny, famous women who talk about life as a woman who is awesome, funny, and famous. The striking thing about this one in particular is how amazingly honest Felicia Day is. She really brings you up close and personal with all of her insecurities, fears, and anxieties. She shares some really dark moments and really lets you into her head and her heart. 
 In the midst of all of this, she is also as funny and charming as you'd expect her to be if you're a fan of hers. I personally love The Guild and is basically the best thing that's ever happened to me (seriously, I have seen it way too many times and know all the words to every song in the actual movie AND in the DVD commentary. Yeah.), so I was prepared for her brand of weird, awkward humour and I was not disappointed. I identified a distressing amount of myself in some of her examples of super awkward/anxious behaviour, and now desperately want to go to Build a Bear (unintentional advertising success!). So even though I was already a fan of Felicia Day, this book just made me like her even more. All the online haters can suck it."
4,"Dru's and her father are hunters who travel from town to town killing creatures of the night - monsters from The Real World that most unsuspecting humans have no idea exist. The story starts with Dru starting at yet another new school which she thinks is pointless as they'll just be moving on again in a couple of months. Fed up with being the new girl she decides to skip school and meets Graves - the local goth boy - but she has no real interest in starting a friendship with him. 
 However, when her father doesn't come home from a hunt, Dru finds herself up against zombies, vampires and werewolves (or suckers and werwulfen as Dru calls them) with no one to help her. Graves comes to her assistance like a knight in shining armor but they are both out of their depth. When Christophe appears on the scene they aren't sure if he can be trusted but as desperate as they are they have no choice but to accept his help, at least temporarily. 
 I really enjoyed Strange Angels and can't wait to continue reading the series. I loved Dru's snarky sense of humor and the fact that she is a strong heroine who will do whatever it takes to survive. She knows her way around weapons and has trained to deal with the supernatural but when she realises she is out of her depth she is willing to accept that she needs help. I also loved Graves - he does his best to take care of Dru despite the fact that he has been thrust into a supernatural world he had no idea existed. I found the fact that he admitted his fears and wasn't always strong made him a more realistic character. Christope is another interesting character but one that we don't get to know as well as I was hoping, I'm guessing that he is going to play a big part in the series though. 
 Being the first book in a series there was obviously a lot of world building going on but I thought Lilith Saintcrow did this really well, explanations were smoothly slotted into the storyline without taking away from the plot. The action was fast paced and there were some fantastic plot twists that helped build the tension levels and I was swept along on the ride with Dru. Although this could be read as a stand alone novel & a lot of loose ends were tied together we are left with quite a cliff hanger that is going to make the next book Betrayals an interesting one to read. I'd definitely recommend this to fans of young adult urban fantasy novels and I think the story would appeal to both teens and adult fans of this genre."

 ""That a misconception, Lennie, the sky is everywhere, it begins at your feet. "" 
 "" I wish my shadow would get up and walk beside me."" 
 "" For the first time in our lives, I'm somewhere she can't fibd, and I don't have the map to give her that leads to me."" 
 ""What do you do when the worst thing that can happen actually happens? "" 
 I liked this book a lot, but I have to confess that the slow pace and the language, which was good in general but seemed forced on many parts, stole the half star away. Nonetheless, the development is good. I felt connected with the characters enough, but I also felt pulled away every time a sentence full of atypical words appeared. In an attempt to build a ""different"" character, the author chose an unrealistic vocabulary for the seventeen year old. It felt awkward and out of place. My impression was that the author wanted the prose to sound lyrical and different, but it didn't work for me. I found myself having to re-read some paragraphs more than once. Such sentences had me thinking, ""Who in the world talk like that? Definitely not a seventeen year old, they just don't."" 
 I could understand Lennie and all her confusing feelings; I could see that her grief was so strong that didn't allow her to see anything clear. Her love for her sister was so strong that when she spoke about her I caught myself grieving for her too. Her relationship with Toby and Joe was turbulent but intense, and I really liked the way that the ""intimate"" scenes were written, leaving a sense of longing for more scenes like that. I had a suspicion about the notes and I found I liked what the author made of it. I liked the end and the message that the author gave with this book was very clear in my eyes. Grief will come and stay as long as you love someone, it will always be there somehow, even while you sleep, but you also need to keep living and fight for make life worth."
5,"I met this author when she did a book tour with Patricia Briggs. She gave me a bookmark with her latest works listed and I just finished her Others trilogy. 
 I absolutely loved it. It had all the elements I love: supernatural, shapeshifters, cuteness, strong heroes and heroines, drama, action, and an alternative universe well set up. Best of all, the proofreading was flawless. I saw no errors. 
 It's a little sweet, almost a children's book except for occasional violence and profanity. As I read more of the series I do see some repetition, but maybe that's because people and creatures are creatures of habit. 
 This had the most exciting episode of the trilogy, a kidnapping attempt. 
 As for the story and setting, in this world the Others (werewolves, vampires, gorgons, elementals, and worse) control everything and humans live on their sufferance. Of course people start to forget this and start pushing back. 
 A separate story involves a prophetic woman who is considered property, her escape, her acceptance by particular Others, and her attempted recovery. This second story dominates here while pushback and retribution are more the themes of books two and three. 
 I highly recommend this to fantasy lovers."
3,"After five months and seven books, my 11-year-old and I have finally finished our read-aloud of the Narnia books. I have to admit, this last book was a bit of a letdown for both of us. Such an odd book. The first several chapters are just dismal, as the world of Narnia is torn apart by trickery and our hero-figure is quickly disarmed and disgraced. Things perk up a bit when familiar faces from our world arrive, but still, the entire plot is rather a downer. Finally, the end brings some happiness... but it's bittersweet in many ways, and was completely confusing to my son until I explained the religious subtext of it all (which I'd mostly managed to avoid up to this point, preferring to read the Narnia books as pure fantasy). I'd never read the Narnia books as a child, so I very much enjoyed this introduction to C. S. Lewis's incredibly imaginative world -- but I do think the series deserves a better ending."
4,"Totes adorbs, and I mean that in the very best way. Who doesn't want to live in a magic castle? This was an all-around good time. I was maybe slightly confused about the tone, because some parts seem a little goofball compared to the more serious parts. It reminded me of one of those older Disney live action movies, like that one Jodie Foster was in, about scamming the estate. This is a very straightforward, fast-paced middle reader. You can tear right through it, it's not weighty in any way, but very fun. 
 My only reservation, and as this is the first in the series and maybe it is addressed more in the following books, was about the essence of the set up -- the royal family and the servants in the castle. Apparently I have become a socialist in my old age, but it felt REALLY jarring to me, that you've got this very grounded, smart, adventurous little girl who is a princess, and all these adults are deferring to her. And it feels like the author bent over backward to create a royal setting where the servants are absolutely treated well, and the regular people have access to the royals, and there is mobility with the whole royal thing, and everyone is very kind ... but it wasn't quite enough to make this stop nagging at me. There was also a bit of a tease where I was starting to expect some sort of juicy reveal, like the servants are really something else in disguise -- I suppose I can hope for the following books. This is really a very minor point though."
5,"It's been such a marvelous series so far and a wonderful discovery!!! 
 I (still) love the characters (main and side); the plot (Cimse outdid herself and nearlu caused the end of the world in her lust for power); the universe, the gracious writing... and above all else Ildiko and Brishen together. They were so well assorted, so vibrant! Sigh... 
 I discovered a new author to follow."
4,"Final Grade: 87/B 
 Rated R 
 REVIEW: This book certainly opened with a bang--Bianca's sitting at a bar in a teen club, waiting for her two friends to stop dancing when the school's ""man-slut"" Wesley tries to chat her up. Bianca's having none of it, especially considering she knows how he operates. And then he calls her The Duff, explaining it means the ""Designated Ugly, Fat Friend"". Bianca tosses a drink in his face and drives her friends home. 
 The relationship between the characters really made this book so realistic and such an interesting read. I loved how the girls all looked out for one another and how snarky Bianca was about Wesley--even after she kisses him (and more. Much more.). There was even some good parental interaction, which you don't always see in YA (parents tend to be absent parents in YA more often than not). And Bianca's problems at home, with her mom and dad, are what lead her to turn to Wesley for comfort. 
 I wasn't so sure about the Wesley-Bianca relationship. I mean, once for whatever reason (in Bianca's case, she needed the comfort of being wanted and to erase her home stress), I guess I can understand it. But again and again and again? Okay, I can see Wesley letting it go on with no need for an explanation. He's a stereotypical guy (at least, at first) who just wants to get some action. But Bianca? She seemed to be too smart and self-confident to do that to herself. However, without going into too much detail, I did like how Bianca and Wesley's relationship continued to develop (sex aside). 
 All in all, a well-constructed story--very enjoyable."

4,"There's this magic of having experience something for a short time. Something that you wish could have been longer. But that's just it. It would be forever embedded in you as something so great but short-lived. But when you think of it, if this experience became longer, to the point that you are fully satisfied,you wouldn't feel the same thing after. It won't be that great anymore because you already had it all. Maybe it's the longingness or the mystery of ""what could have been."" This is what I think happened to Hadley and Oliver. It's something to cute and fun that when it's time to part ways, they find their meeting so extraordinary. Or maybe, it's the statistical probability of love at first sight. 
 I like the narrative way the story was written. It's like Fault in the stars meet The perks of being a wallflower style of writing. I felt that there's a depth in the story, something that is more than meets the eye. And actually it is. I was expecting of a love story here that started from the moment they saw each other (which it really is) but other than that, it's a story of the relationship between parents, it subtly tells the children to cherish the moments they have now, whether they are very close to their parents or not, it's also a story of forgiveness, of moving on, of new like and taking chances. 
 As for the characters, I adore Hadley and Oliver. Hadley is very young to experience a broken family but she coped with it the way she knows how. I can't blame her for getting angry. She has all the rights to be. She's the daughter who was left picking up the pieces when her father left. And now, she needs to endure the pain of watching her father weds to another woman. I totally agree with her for not wanting to come and I hated her mother a bit for forcing her to. But I guess mothers know best still huh? :D But I find Hadley very brave for handling everything and being mature until the end. And as for Oliver, what I only saw is what Hadley is seeing from her. But that's enough for me to fall in love with his character. 
 It's just a 24-hour love story, but it was like a story of forever. I love how it's became an instant love but it seems like they have known each other their whole life. An ideal love story, a fairy tale if I must say, but still, who wouldn't fall for this kind of story?"
3,"Sweet read but unfortunately it goes against several decisions made in The Cursed Child, which felt a bit weird. Some part seems a bit off too. Overall it's always nice to get back into the Potterverse."

 Abby is so damn pure and innocent and perfect ... and good girl fell for the bad boy .... okayy 
 Recommended?"
3,"Rating 3.25 stars 
 Book had potential, writing was nice but I felt the hero got off easy, not much grovelling required from him. 
 I actually read this one first before the sister's book. The hero used to be loved by everyone then he went off the rails because of a hidden tragedy, acted badly, slept around and during that time he was vicious to the heroine. 
 The heroine hates that the hero has now been transferred from the Dodgers to her home team Blaze, where she works in the media department and that makes the hero her head-ache. He called her unworthy of a man's attention, something that played on the heroine's past and her body issues. She has had a long and hard struggle to accept her body. 
 The hero acts like a dick at first and I liked how the heroine didn't mind verbally slapping him. They get involved things are fine, then something so contrived happened and the hero acts like a dick again, he apologizes and she takes him back. The END!"

2,"When I first started this, I really thought I would enjoy it more than I did. This isn't a bad 2-star rating, it's just a meh rating. The book definitely had its moments of dark, atmospheric prose and little creepy details that made me really intrigued but, overall, the payoff was lackluster and the pace left a lot to be desired. The last 60 pages were a whirlwind and I was underwhelmed by the conclusion."
4,"This was my first venture into the world of audio books and I'm sorry that I waited so long. I was concerned that I would find it hard to concentrate on the story if I was busy doing other things, like housework etc., but I had no such problem. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and didn't feel like I was working at all. While I have no experience otherwise, I enjoyed how these narrators, Emma Galvin and Keith Nobbs, portrayed the characters. And I feel that this job being well done, added to my enjoyment of the book overall. 
 The basic concept of this book comes from a Tarot card deck. For every card, there is a teenager who represents it. 
 Evie is pretty, popular and well off, living in the second biggest house in town. Jackson, is a Cajun, from the Bayou, where their houses are little more than shacks. Evie and her friends look down at the Cajun's when they start at their school, but after the Flash, it seems Jackson may be the only one left who can protect her. 
 This book begins with the POV of Arthur, a creepy guy who keeps girls in his cellar. When Evie stumbles upon his house and begins to tell him her story, we move onto her POV. We learn about her life before the Flash, and after, about her mother, Jackson, and other interesting characters we meet along the way. 
 Evie and Jackson were both really likeable characters. Their relationship starts out really antagonistic with Evie hating the fact that she has to rely on him. As they journey across the country together, her feelings for him change. Very frustratingly though, she doesn't trust him enough to share the secrets he knows she has, and this is pushing him away. Maybe even into the arms of another girl. 
 The secondary characters that they pick up along the way were an interesting bunch, each one representing one of the Tarot cards. Celena is the moon card, and the bringer of doubt. Phin is the magician and Matthew, the psychic, is an autistic boy that Evie looks to for direction, but who sometimes just leaves her with more questions. 
 I thought the ending of this was just brilliant. Answering a question I'd been wondering about the entire book. Evie embraces her power and what she can do and as we finish, Jackson is just staring at her open mouthed. I'm really excited for the next book. 
 *As I listened to this one, I feel that some of the names/words may be spelt differently than what appeared in the book, so apologise for any discrepancies."
4,"Leashing the Tempest is a fun short in the Arcadia Bell series. Cady, Lon, Jupe and Kar Yee (Cady's friend and bar co-owner) are heading out to sea to practice Jupe's demon knack. On the trip, they discover the Capt has a secret that has come back to bite him. 
 I love this series and enjoyed this short. The characters are wonderfully written. Thanks for the snack before Binding the Shadows, Ms. Bennett!"
5,"I won this book in a First Reads giveaway here on Goodreads. All opinions are my own. 
 The Mermaid's Sister is a well written, young adult fantasy novel. I really enjoyed the writing style, the characters and the setting. Everything is described so well that I could picture it all in my mind. The main character, Clara, is very easy to relate to. She's an ordinary young girl who will do whatever it takes to save her sister, Maren, who's turning into a mermaid. She embarks on a voyage to take her to the sea via wagon with their childhood friend, O'Neill. Their pets Pilsner, a raven, and Osbert, a wyvern (dragon), tag along. In their world, magic, faeries, elves and other magical folk are common. It's also 1870 and traveling shows are quite popular. 
 The author did a great job conveying the characters' emotions. I could feel the despair that Clara felt when she thought they wouldn't be able to save Maren, the confusion over her feelings for O'Neill and her feelings of being less important because she's doesn't have a special skill like the other two (O'Neill can talk to animals). 
 The beginning of the books was a little slow, but it picks up once the group leaves Llanfair Mountain. The dialogue between the three teens really sounds like three lifelong friends talking together would. They talk about everything and nothing. The last third of the book is great. It's hard to decide which member of the troupe that kidnaps them is the worst. There are little things that are mentioned here and there that really connect everything together by the climax of the book. I like that almost everyone got a happy ending. I liked this book so much that I would read it again. I also really like the main quote ""There is no cure for being who you truly are."" 
 I would recommend this to anyone who likes fantasy, historical fiction, magic and mermaids."
3,"I hate leaving reviews for things I didn't finish, but I do owe Amazon a review for this book. Readers beware: I gave up about halfway through this book, but not because it was awful. 
 What do I mean by that? By ""not awful"" I mean that this book has a lot of things in it that many readers will love. It has many of the same things that I liked from the first book, such as vampires, weird plagues, and exploration of cities long abandoned and ransacked by the plague. There's a lot of action-filled scenes, so it's not really like there were many lulls in the read. My only big complaint was that I couldn't quite feel the chemistry between Allison and Zeke in TEC like I could in the previous entry. Another reviewer referred to him as a ""wet rag"" and at times I kind of agreed with her. Don't get me wrong, Zeke has reasons to be how he is. I just didn't really get into him in this book. 
 I just can't figure out why I didn't like this. I got about halfway through the book before I finally just gave up and decided that this will just be a series that I'll never finish. It might be because I'm starting to get a little tired of dystopian YA books, so I'll hold out for the hope that I'll eventually want to read this in the future. I just felt like a huge outsider reading this, as I kept wondering what it was that everyone else was seeing in this. 
 If you were half-hearted on the first book, I'd recommend getting this from the library. If you loved the first one then you'll probably be one of the many who liked this and this will be a ""must buy"". However if you think for even a second there's a chance you might end up being ""meh"" over it, I recommend getting it from the library as well. 
 I'm giving this three stars because while I didn't like it, I can see where it was well crafted and would give a lot of joy to other readers. However, I can't quite muster up the enthusiasm to give it much more than that.

4,"An interesting book. This is the first novel by Dick that I've read, and I can see why he's entered the sci-fi canon: there are tremendous thematic resonances littered throughout the thing, but it's all so discursive and slightly askew that it's hard to imagine that they're deliberately engineered that way. It seems like they must have bubbled out of Dick's own febrile preoccupations, and that makes them feel both more interesting and more honest. 
 This is a fairly slight work. Ben kept describing it to me as short, but at 300 pages it's longer than the novella I was half-expecting. Yet I now share his impression. I think part of this effect arises from its limited scope: the book really only tries to appeal in two ways. 
 The first is by presenting an alternate history story about the Axis winning WWII. This plot idea is pretty well-worn by now (though of course this is to Dick's credit). I'm not enough of a history buff to really care about this. There's a lot of counterfactual-definition that I found myself skimming past. Some people will be fascinated by all this -- ""YOU MEAN THE NAZI UNDERSECRETARY OF FINANCE SURVIVED THE WAR? AND STARTED WEARING A DIFFERENT HAT?! *head explodes*"" -- but I was not. Admittedly, most of my knowledge of WWII comes from Indiana Jones movies, so I'll go ahead and say it's my fault that I didn't like this more. 
 The second and much more important thing the book does is ruminate on the nature of authenticity and the process by which we impute meaning to objects and institutions (keep an eye out for the word ""historicity""). This is done through a number of different means. There is of course the idea about the arbitrary nature of history that the alternate WWII scenario represents. But much of the theoretical action happens via the cultural imperialism that follows military imperialism. It's fascinating to observe Dick's mirror-image of American cultural dominance, as (white) American characters emulate, admire and resent their Japanese conquerors. He certainly has a fuller imagination for this effect than I do/did. 
 Dick stumbles, though, in his conclusion, which seems to suggest (through both the EdFrank jewelry business and the I Ching's final revelation to the characters) that there is, somewhere, a wellspring of cultural authenticity, shrouded in mysticism and non-cerebral attributes, rather than an endless web of subjective but important imputed values. It's a particularly glaring missed opportunity, because the Nazis happen to have had some really batshit crazy ideas about cultural origination, authenticity and debasement, and pursued them on a monolithic scale in ways that were both fascinating and horrifying. 
 Dick's sympathy toward authenticity and truth have more than a little in common with that mindset, but instead of seeing this and exploring it, he simply paints his Germans as hi-tech psychopaths (which is fair enough). Still, it's a missed opportunity, and an incorrect philosophical analysis, I think."
5,"Couldn't put it down; now I keep thinking about this world. It's got adventure, romance, special powers, a journey, survival -- a bit of everything! I really felt Katsa's internal dilemmas regarding her Grace and what is expected of women."

 Friday Brown is the fishing lure to my fish nature. It drops in to my sight, sunlight refracting everywhere, and as it's slowly reeled in, it draws me out, slowly, slowly, and then in a moment, I bite out of curiosity and it doesn't let go. I thrash and thrash but it holds onto me, holds onto my emotional core and doesn't let up. I'm reeled in, then unable to breathe. Then I'm suddenly dropped back into the water, relieved but still battered. (Let's just say I'm a fish with a human's memory.) 
 Hey, analogies... why you gotta be so ridiculous?"
5,"More book and movie reviews at Barely Sane Reviews on Tumblr! 
 I kind of adore this book. I mentioned before that it's just one of those things that are naturally fit for me as it touches on a lot of topics that I'm interested in, specifically suicide, Buddhism, and writing. Both sides of the story are set in places that I have a personal affinity for: the city and the island. Also, quite a chunk of it talks about the tsunami that hit Japan on March 11, 2011 (known in local circles as my sixteenth birthday). So you can see how easy it is for me to gravitate towards this novel. 
 On a more objective note, this book reminded me of two other books - The Elegance of the Hedgehog by Muriel Barbery and The History of Love by Nicole Krauss. Like the former, the protagonists are two intelligent women who initially seem to be at odds but have a sort of intellectual connection, though the characters in A Tale for the Time Being are easier to warm up to. Unlike Paloma, Nao actually sounds her age and deals with situations that are in turns serene and visceral. Coming from a mostly YA reading background, I really appreciated this. Like the latter, both protagonists are writers in a sense and have unique writing styles that make them sound real and relatable. 
 Speaking of reality, there is a very thin line here between fiction and non-fiction. As you may have noticed, one of the protagonists shares a name and occupation as the author of the novel, which is because she is supposed to be the author of the novel. This lends an interesting believability to the novel that's hard to let go of even when the supernatural elements are introduced. It plays a lot with the suspension of disbelief and I think it's most successful if, like a lot of things, you just go with it. 
 There's a lot packed into this book and I could go on forever discussing all its little details and everything I learned from it. Another great thing about it: it's one of those books that make you feel smarter without being in your face about it. It has appendices and a bibliography, you guys, and it still manages to be friendly and conversational. Nao's parts have a lot of information about Japanese culture and Zen Buddhism while Ruth's parts focus on environmentalism and a little bit of physics(?). There's also a third character whose parts focus more on a historical/philosophical point of view. I learned a lot about Japan and Canada and honestly, it wasn't until I read this book that I realized that most of literary diet has been from and about the US and England. I'm definitely going to work on reading books from and about the other parts of the world, hopefully from non-first world countries as well though that might be harder to find. 
 My only major quibble is that it ended with a dash of didacticism, which I was not to keen on but I'm willing to forgive because behind all the existential, intellectual aspects are characters who I ended up rooting for and who I want to have happy endings. 
 I'm warning you: there's not a lot of answers at the end, much less any explanation for why things happened the way they did. But this isn't a book you read for answers or explanations; it's a book you read if you want to take your time. So if you do, indeed, have a lot of time (I read it for three weeks!), please pick this one up for the time being."
4,"IQ ""They were still in the happier stage of love. They were full of brave illusions about each other, tremendous illusions, so that the communion of self with self seemed to be on a plane where no other human relations mattered. They both seemed to have arrived there with an extraordinary innocence as though a series of pure accidents had driven them together, so many accidents that at least they were forced to conclude that they were for each other. They had arrived with clean hands, or so it seemed, after no traffic with the merely curious and clandestine."" Pg. 86 
 The non-linear structure and interspersed flashbacks did bother me (that seems to be a common theme in my reviews lately). I also didn't understand why certain incidents went down. I'm sure if I took a class with the book an English professor could have explained the deeper meaning behind things but some parts just seemed scattered and unnecessary. They did little to move along the little plot there was. As usual for Fitzgerald this novel is largely character-driven, delving into character's feelings and what makes them tick. However I do think some of his secondary characters fell by the wayside which is unusual. It goes beyond alcoholism this time to also candidly discuss sex which I found surprising but I wonder if the Jazz Age is when authors started more frankly mentioning it/using obvious metaphors? And then it discusses homosexuality and pedophilia, two topics rarely mentioned during this time. The conclusions drawn will not be satisfactory to the reader, at least to me, I felt that Fitzgerald could have dived deeper into Dick's psyche in this area. 
 I always like charmer characters and Dick Diver was no exception until you learn some of his very dark secrets and desires. And yet you still feel a twinge of sympathy for him as his life completely falls apart. He is a tragic hero, he attempts to 'save' Nicole and yet loses himself. I also liked that Dick was a psychiatrist who didn't psychoanalyze everyone, I've always hated that psychiatrists likely act that way outside of their offices and I found it refreshing that Dick was so blind to the causes of his own meltdown. Even the best and the brightest can't always clearly see themselves. I love love love Fitzgerald's writing oh my goodness. Just read that quote I highlighted at the beginning of the review, smooth as butter. He has a knack for drawing similes and metaphors that are a far cry from the cliched ones that existed at his time (not that I would really know I guess). He describes a sort of love triangle that has arisen over Nicole; ""Later in the garden she was happy; she did not want anything to happen, but only for the situation to remain in suspension as the two men tossed her from one mind to another; she had not existed for a long time, even as a ball"" (297), I love that bit. And you absolutely fall into the lavish world of the Divers on the French Riviera (I thought it was supposed to be sort of based on Gerald & Sara Murphy but other reviews said it's based off of Scott & Zelda which does make more sense since I don't think the Murphys were quite as f'ed up). Highly recommended for a vacation-setting that will transport you but creep you out a bit with the topics while enchanting you with the language.

5,"I can get so much reading done on my way to university it's amazing 
 ANYWAY 
 Light spoilers! 
 I was first going to give this book only 4 stars because I mean, come on, of course they were going to fall in love 
 BUT 
 I adored this story. I loved the sassiness of it and how Cas just dealt with all of this. I loved Carmel as such a strong character and her voice of reason. I also really loved Thomas and his grandfather who remined me a bit of Bobby from Supernatural. 
 It was not really scary like some other horror books I have read but it had a dark twist to it which was just what I needed. 
 I didn't really expect to like this book so much but it was everything I could have hoped for. It made me gasp, laugh, smile and shake my head at it and I realize I now have to buy the second book."
3,"This was a very amusing diversion for a Sunday afternoon. Working at a public library myself, I recognized lots of things, and I hope to never run into some of the others."
2,"I am 80% into this short novel and very, very puzzled by it. Reading it is rather like putting together an abstract jigsaw--the pieces individually are quite nice, they do fit together, only...there's no final picture. I almost feel as if I've come into a series halfway through--I'm missing all the key hooks to make sense of this story. There is an earlier book with one of the characters, apparently, but I'm not convinced reading that would help all that much with this. 
 Also, there are things happening that are seriously testing my willingness to suspend disbelief. For example, we are told that one of the characters has had a serial killer carve on her bones. She then survived and had her wounds stitched, but she never got to see or know what this guy had carved. When we do find out, he carved intricate pictures of the characters in the novel who, at the time of the carving, would not have existed (or been only children). I have no problem with this clever omen: it's a supernatural book, after all. But how could anyone carve pictures on ""living"" bone that are so intricate you can recognise faces, or see what someone is holding? It's a bit daft. Imagine it...he's made wounds on a woman he's got partly sedated with alcohol and through those wounds accesses her bones and then is able to create five separate portraits detailed enough to recognise five different people? Nah, I'm not buying it. 
 Secondly, I'm having major issues with the narrator in this. He refers to himself in the first person, but he also seems an omnipotent narrator: always present, always knowing what each person is thinking when they are the focus of the scene. It's distracting and annoying. 
 I will finish because I want to see if I'm missing something or if I'm just stupid. 
 I'll update when done. 
 Done. I'm suspecting it's not me but this book. Right to the end there is an omnipotent narrator present at all the action (and not present when other characters are alone) but who knows all their thoughts and feelings. We never know who this person is and no one in the group ever acknowledges his presence or refers to him, discusses him. The drawings found on the bones include all the characters in the therapy group except...yep, this narrator. 
 We went about our evening routines, trying to think of something else. Harrison poured himself one last drink. Martin strapped Stan into his frame. Jan made her way down the stairs and Greta, in some city unknown to the rest of us, locked the door of her hotel room. Each of us, as we turned off the light, felt a tingle of dread....Some of us thought of what Jan had whispered in the basement... 
 I feel that ought to be rewritten: 
 We went about our evening routines. I suspected we were trying to think of something else. Harrison was clearly wondering who I was, as I've been hanging around with this tiny group of characters for the entire story without anyone acknowledging my presence. Was he mad? I'm sure he began to suspect it. Martin strapped Stan into his frame, possibly wondering why I didn't help. But he didn't know my name so couldn't ask. Jan made her way down the stairs, pretty cut up, I suspect, that being the therapist who'd organised the sessions in the first place, she'd missed that she had another person in a group of only five to start with, but she'd neglected to find out who I was. Greta, well, what can I say? I wasn't in the city where she locked the door of her hotel room and she didn't apparently know I existed, so we're both insane. I have no idea what everyone thought that night. I'm not sure I know what I think half the time, being...invisible and not really there. Maybe I'm a tribute to David Bowie...Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend... 
 Interesting ideas not fleshed out and confused from beginning to end."
4,This book felt frighteningly real. All the emotions and the people made it feel like something that could really happen. The story was fast paced and extremely interesting. It got me thinking what I would do if something like this really happened. It also made me miss my family and really appreciate how good things are right now.
3,Really slow read. Review to come.
5,"*** Copy provided to Bayou Book Junkie in exchange for a fair and honest review. *** 
 This is the penultimate installment in this series, *whimpers* and I'm not ready to say goodbye yet to Will and Patrick (especially Patrick!). In this book, Patrick meets Will's father, Tony, and he comes to terms with being in love with Will. 
 I truly adore this series more than words can express. The writing is stellar and the storyline just keeps getting better and better. While I wasn't too sure about Will at first, he's grown on me, especially in this episode. He's really growing up and becoming a better man, and thankfully, he's not blinded by his ex any longer. Patrick is still his snarky self, but we're seeing this other side of him, the side that is head over heels in love with Will and that is vulnerable and not sure how to cope with being in love with someone for the first time. 
 Life is so interesting in Healing and Patrick keeps winning allies, the secondary cast is amazing and I just can't get enough of all of them. 
 I could've done without the evil cliffhanger, but at least, I won't have to wait all that long for the last book in the series. I just hope April 30th comes by quickly! 
 Rating: 5 Stars!!!"
5,"Jessica wanted to be in Paris now - going to college ... 
 But she got sick and couldn't fly, so, what is she doing? She's accepted a job her Hollywood agent aunt offered her: be the personal assistant to one of her clients. She secretly hopes for someone along the lines of Martha Stewart - she'd love to learn some baking secrets from her....but who does she get? 
 Jack McAlister - Hollywood's hottest actor! She hates actors - due to some unmention-worthy ex-boyfriend of hers, who only used her to get an in with her aunt. 
 And Jack, Jack is mega-hot, but he's so annoying! Yelling at her all the time (ok, she probably shouldn't have put his pet pig in a closed bag!). But he's also nice and caring and adorable, at least in those tiny little seconds when she sees something different in his eyes... 
 But she's not there to fall in love, she's there to make money. 
 --------------------------------- 
 So adorable! 
 I really loved this story. 
 Such a funny and cute and even moving Hollywood romance! 
 Jack is this huge superstar, but he's also this sad little boy inside, and he's opening up to Jess more and more. 
 And Jess, with all her big plans of France and baking, and now she's here with this Actor - and she hates actors, but she just can't hate Jack. Even when he yells at her. He's also so kind and he listens and he cares and of course it helps that he's so terrible good looking. 
 BEYOND THE STARS was an amazingly beautiful and funny and cute Hollywood Romance! You need to one-click yourselves some Jack McAlister asap!!! 
 Was there may something I didn't like? Hm, maybe a dual POV wouldn't have hurt?? - I would've loved to hear Jack's thoughts. You just don't get to know him the way you might want to. 
 Maybe this story could've been made into a 3-part series with just more happening to Jess and Jack to make the story a bit bigger and deeper somehow....BUT - it was really good just the way it is!!!"
4,"Well, that was really, really good! I loved the way it made fun of all the paranormal teen novel tropes while still treating them with respect, and I loved that the humour of it didn't undermine the story Ness is telling about these characters and their changing relationships and increasing self-knowledge on the verge of high school graduation. 
 The only thing that bothered me: (view spoiler)[I loved how this book engaged with mental illness -- and remember dear readers, it is not mental illness if it isn't causing distress! But Mel's anorexia and Mike's anxiety/OCD are clearly very distressing, and I loved that they were talked about and explored as a natural part of everything happening in the novel. I particularly loved that Mike's psychiatrist argued so strongly that for Mike to see his mental illness as a moral failing he must overcome by willpower doesn't help and that the thing to do is treat it like any other medical issue. So I was really frustrated when, at the end, Mike decides not to let Jared heal him. It was, I think, in character -- Mike doesn't believe that his OCD is medical, he does feel like he should overcome it by being a better person, and so of course he turns Jared down. But I wish there had been a callback to the scene with the psychiatrist in there, even just Mike thinking 'Well I know Dr. Luther would tell me to go for it,' since as it stands the message that Mike does not NEED to suffer gets lost. 
 It occurs to me thinking about all of this that there is a good overlap between the indie kids being Chosen Ones and one of the typical ways mental illness gets handled in books, which as something terrible which nonetheless makes the character a Special Snowflake. Mike still feels like his anxiety & OCD are things that mark him as set apart for unique challenges and suffering, and he is not ready to get rid of that, just like the second Finn was saying 'Oh no I'm not supposed to have survived.' I wonder if Mel really would take Jared up on his offer? From the scene in the nursing home I think she has let go of the idea that her anorexia is a special cursed gift and she now sees it as just a thing she has to deal with. (hide spoiler)] 
 Anyway, I loved this book, and if it had been just a little more complex/dense at the end and a little slower in exploring some of those issues it would definitely be a 5 star read. I am going to go back now and read everything else Patrick Ness has ever written!"
4,"There was an ease and joy about this one that seemed to be lacking in the last couple. It is goofier than most of the Russell books, though. Really quite goofy at times."
1,"I can only give this one star because, obviously I didn't finish it, meaning I didn't like it. I got about 40% of the way in and I just couldn't stand any of it. The plot seemed like it was going to be good, different- more dark, which is awesome because that's so hard to find. But it didn't read that dark, at least the protagonist's life didn't seem that dark."
4,4.5 Stars. Solid urban fantasy in a neat setting with an interesting way to introduce the heroine. Good story too with an interesting twist.
5,"It's more like a 4.5 Star book. 
 So I downloaded this book out of curiosity. I wanted to see how the story about a Bully and the Victim falling in love would play out. It wasn't exactly what I imagined, but it was good in it's own way."
3,"Pretty good story. There were a lot of loose ends, mainly with Bones and Cat so I hope the author writes a follow up."
4,"Cute story. It's a very light book, quick to read, slightly predictable in places and slightly too black-and-white characters, but still adorable and reading this is definitely not a bad way to spend one's time."
4,I loved this book I just wish that it ended differently for Tousle.
2,"Girl moves to little town. Her mother has abandoned her and her family. She's a witch, but her training as such hasn't been completed. Only women can learn to be witches, for men is a secret. 
 Boy is an outcast. Everyone in town knows that there's a ""course"" in his family (as they call it), every generation there's a relative that goes mad, ensuring they have visions of the future in their dreams, and they end up killing themselves. 
 There's something dark in town, dark magic. Maybe there's a dark source... or a dark witch in town? 
 What I liked: 
 -The essence of the story. New start, new story. Autumn, cold, rain, little ancient houses. I loved this dark-but-magical nature on the whole story (check out the author's pinterest amazing pictures!) Those dark scenes under water, at night time, the small town, everything is so dark... and what a better way to portrait this story? 
 -Nadia. Her life changes when her mother abandons her family and she kinda takes her role as mother in the family, but she doesn't complain about it. That's the right thing to do and she will do it without thinking otherwise. She's strong, she's scared, but she doesn't hesitate on doing the right thing. 
 -Elizabeth. yay to you! You know exactly how to make the whole town (view spoiler)[worship you and stay at your feet without them even noticing. (hide spoiler)]I really like you, girl! (view spoiler)[You're creepy as hell. (hide spoiler)] Cool backstory (though it could have played a bigger role in the story...) 
 -Gage. Yes, I know, he's a minor character, but he's one of those minor characters that is completely necessary to the story to release weight off readers' shoulders. He's nice, fun, and cares for Mateo! 
 -Verlaine. Got ya girl, you're story is reaaally interesting, but the book has relegated you to a ""minor"" character WHICH IS WRONG. 
 -The way Nadia casts spells. I found really unique the way emotions take a really important part on the process, how they're bond to the magic she casts. And not just random emotions, but specific memories in her life that serve as ingredients to her. Really original! 
 -Perfect example in how a story doesn't need a bunch of characters to feel right: just Nadia, Mateo, Elizabeth and Verlaine. For sure there are more characters in the story, but they don't play a bigger part. 
 What I didn't like: 
 -Mateo. Sorry boy, I can't help it. He's childish. His actings and reactions to the development in the story... just no. They don't feel right. May be I'm used to strong male characters in Claudia Gray's other stories, those who stand up for them and other people and have presence. And he doesn't. 
 -Verlaine. (OK, not true. I DID like you, but you don't fit quiet right in this story). There's something with this character... at the beginning of the story it feels like the author wanted to add a new one to fill the book and she's the one she used. It doesn't feel as she's someone important to the story, just that girl no one notices over there. She's unique, she hasn't been driven by some high school prototypes, but I feel like this wasn't the right place for her, she deserved better. Her character gets more interesting at the end of the story and maybe the thing with her is that it could be really interesting if she was the main character of her own story, you know? 
 -Consistency -or narration- of the story. It felt like there where many minor scenes to fill the pages, bit of little scenes here and there, quick change of scenarios, etc. The rhythm is pretty slow and then, at the end, there's a quick closure, as if the character have been doing nothing for a considerably bunch of pages and then the whole thing gets sort out, almost on its own. 
 There was something about the narration that bothered me a bit, maybe I was expecting more rationing or 
 development on Nadia's thoughts, a more intimate story, more close to her. I would've preferred more introspection instead of some daily narration that does not provide anything relevant to the story. (view spoiler)[I would've enjoyed more deepening on Mateo and his curse, everything is very subtle... loved the way he can finally see the curse is real with the black halo on his head, though. (hide spoiler)] 
 I kinda was expecting a more mature story, and I found myself with these high school characters, that OK, I get it, they have sixteen, but... 
 If you enjoyed Spellcaster, give a chance to Beautiful Creatures (or viceversa!) I found many similarities between both stories and if you liked one, is very likely you enjoy the other one as well!"
4,"I was so excited to read The Nightmare Affair, I love paranormal reads and the main character, Dusty, being a ""Nightmare"" sounded awesome. The entire concept seemed so unique to anything I've read and needless to say it did not disappoint. 
 Dusty was a great protagonist. I loved her suspicious nature, even though it got her into trouble quite a few times. I also loved how Eli came into play, at first I thought they were going to despise him but I grew to love him throughout the book. I loved how he was always trying to look out for Dusty, despite the fact that he had zero magical powers. A lot of the characters though were just ""fillers"" for me... I wasn't attached to many of them so that was made me rate the book down one star. I really only loved the two main characters, so the supporting characters fell a bit flat for me. 
 One of the main things that drew me to the story initially was the fact that it was a paranormal boarding school. Boarding school books are up there in my Top Ten settings for all Young Adult books and the fact that it was a school entirely for paranormals and MagicKind just topped it off. There were so many different ""MagicKinds"" in The Nightmare Affair. Initially I thought it would feature a lot of the usual, and while it did, there were also some interesting ones. Obviously the Nightmares were my favorite. The entire concept of them, the way they could warp dreams and then to throw in the dream seer concept as well just enthralled me. 
 For a debut novel, I was pleasantly surprised. Mindee Arnett's writing style is fabulous. I was instantly sucked in from page one, and she really did a great job of keeping the reader interested. I also really enjoyed the mystery, which is essentially the main part of the story. Honestly, I had my suspicions with everyone throughout the novel so much so that when the time came I was actually surprised, because I really didn't know who it would be. Arnett really does a great job of wrapping up the mystery as well. The closer I got to the end, the more nervous I became: I thought she would leave us hanging until book two, but it's really wrapped up well and doesn't leave you crying for more at the end. 
 I will absolutely be continuing this series and I cannot wait to see what is next in story for Dusty and the Arkwell Academy series! If you love paranormal stories I highly recommend it!"
5,"This book is crazy fun. The narrative tone of the book is hilarious without distracting from the characters and story, and it subverts so many tropes in a creative way. Despite that, it's not jokey or gimmicky--there's solid character work and genuine emotion, and the specificity in description is great. The concept and humor is a selling point, but not the main feature. I love that an LGBTQA Latina is at the center of the story, too. If this were the start of a series I would 100% read all of it."
5,"This is one of those series that keeps getting better and as my new favorite couple's (Nikolas Mikkelsen & Benjamin Rider) relationship reached a new high - a lot of things were also revealed about their past that could have great impact in their relationship but we all know it by now right? - Love conquers all. Period. Stop. Ssshhh. 
 The Bridge of Silver Wings is part disturbing and part mysterious. When Nik and Ben found themselves in the midst of Gulag prisoner's territory - they almost lost hope of surviving the brutality of their situation. And there is one thing certain for Nik - he would keep Ben alive at all cost. The whole thing about the first part of this novel is nothing short of shuddering. It was like a nightmare that won't end for all the characters involved and for its readers. It was like watching Hannibal where you are always at the edge of your seat. At some point, I was almost afraid to turn the next page I'm almost shaking. Here, we see the intensity of Nik's love for Ben. We see Nik here as someone almost inhuman. He's been through this place and he survived it then and he's gonna die trying to get Ben see himself out of this. That part about Ben getting ""assaulted"" was the most disturbing part for me. The trauma it caused Ben, the denial and just the way John Wiltshire spin that conversation between Nik and Ben just gave me goose bumps all throughout - it's almost too reverent if you think about it. Not even the gory killings horrify me as much. 
 The second part of the book detailed Ben's discovery of his father's side. I didn't exactly like this part of the book because Ben started second-guessing things about himself and Nik. I thought what happened with them previously is proof enough that it's 100% solid with them. Here, Ben was acting like he's twenty-two. Seriously, I was so annoyed when he got away with it so easily and he doesn't even have to grovel that much. The whole thing about his ""cousin's death"" was a tad predictable but it's a good predictable. And fuck, I think I started hating Kate here. Is this when she started having her POV? I'm like - bitch please, I know you're up to something in the next book/s - ugh. Little did I know this would hold true. 
 I'm weeping with Nik over here. I can totally feel his pain here. I really do love them as a couple but I'm team Nik come hell or high water. He's like my little baby Nik and I hated the fact that Ben just doesn't seem appreciate him that much here. He's very lucky that Nik loves him very much. The ending was beautiful as usual but it just gives me the creep that something wicked is about to happen next. 
 Man' what can I say? I'm just totally in love with this series. Get your copy now or you'll miss out big time! 
 Rating: 5 out of 5 stars"
5,"Science fiction is really, really good when it's done right. It's even better when you have a cast of characters full of dark, sarcastic banter. 'The Martian' starts out with its main character (Mark Whatney) finding himself stuck on Mars, abandoned by his crew due to an accident that left him presumed dead. The remaining narrative centers around surviving in a completely alien world, isolated from all life, and of course, the ensuing attempt to return to Earth. 
 The book was very heavy on science and facts, with the author going so far as to create a model solar system to better understand moon and planetary orbits, weather patterns, and Mars geography. The details are astonishingly realistic and precise, and so is the emotional and intellectual resilience of Whatney as evidenced through his ship logs. This optimism in the face of despair is a common criticism of the book, but I am going to go out on a limb here and say that NASA would not pick any astronauts for a mission if they did NOT have the ability to be resilient under stress, as space travel is an extremely risky venture. An average person would absolutely not be able to handle it - but average people also don't make it past the psych eval in the first place. In any case, it seemed plausible to me that someone in a dire situation would have to view things with humor in order to not just give up and die. 
 Overall, this was a challenging, exhausting, and exhilarating book - and I devoured it over a few hours. If that's not worthy of a 5 star rating I don't know what is."
5,"I. Loved. This. Book. I could not read it fast enough!!! This book breaks barriers, and I was rooting for Wavy, Kellan, and their unconventional love the whole way. Their story is passionate and magical. It is raw and graphic and original. Keep an eye on this author (love how she's local- from Kansas!) - I know she will be someone to watch!! 
 PS: If you liked the fresh originality of this book, try The Ribs and Thigh Bones of Desire, by Sandra Hutchison."
0,"I picked this up for free from the book swap at YALC because I'm a big Hamlet nerd and it appealed to those sensibilities. I've written up some notes for a book review, but I'm in Ireland with limited internet, so it'll be a week or so before I get around to writing those up fully (here and on the blog)."
4,"An amazingly well-written book, highly recommended. A doctor's wife has twins in the 1960s, and he sends the girl away because she has Downs, not anticipating that the nurse he sends her with will choose to raise her. I love the way Edwards desribes things - emotions and settings - you really feel like you're there."
4,"I realized when I was looking at some old reviews the other day that I read The Magician's Nephew several years ago with the intention to read the Narnia books all the way through in internal chronological order. The same thought apparently piqued in my brain then that does now, a truly haunting thought, 'am I actually 100% sure I have read all the Chronicles of Narnia?'. I know I've read this one plenty of times, magician's nephew, prince caspian, voyage of the dawn treader, horse and his boy I owned for some reason. But the last battle? The silver chair? If I read them I have completely forgotten them, and even Horse and his Boy and Voyage of the Dawn Treader I only remember reading bc I can recall maybe one detail from them, not that I can remember anything else. 
 Unacceptable! I say. Simply unacceptable! 
 So here I go. Although I have converted, I have no desire to read them in chronological order. It seems rather silly to do so, actually. That can't be the intended way (as loathe as I am to place any value at all to anything the author intended that isn't written on the page), and it can't be the most effective way to process them. I mean, coming into Narnia for the first ever time through any way other than the wardrobe honestly feels like a sin. 
 But enough nonsense, lets discuss this book. 
 I don't know if I have anything original or telling or well-articulated to say about this book, (what can I say that hasn't already been said, and usually better than me?). But I must say that this book is magic. It really is. This book is all the magic of childhood and imagination and a million magic lands and everything a fantasy novel aspires to be. I read my fair share of fantasy, but nothing hits the interception between nostalgia and pure magic quite like this book. (Nothing. Not even Harry Potter. And that is how you know that I am Serious about this.) It's so clearly a children's book, written like a children's book, and yet so absolutely wonderful as adult reading. (although the Christ imagery is remarkably hard-hitting, I can barely believe I ever missed it, even as a ten year old). The child's story told so clearly from an adult voice, as if by a storyteller, is not something we see a ton of nowadays, and I love it. There's no other way this book could be. Going into Narnia the first time, with Lucy, with Edmund, then with all four, feels just like it did the first time. Honestly. I don't remember reading this book the first time, I don't know how many times I've read it, but I know I felt the kind of magic this time that I felt all the time as a child reading something amazing, a totally different type of magic than me today discovering something magical (which I am privileged to do so often). It feels... softer. Lighter. Fuzzier. More distant, but at the same time closer. It's too wonderful for words. 
 One last note: I found myself relating way too hard to Edmund and it makes me a little uncomfortable tbh. I mean, yes, I get that Edmund is the most fleshed out of any of the siblings bc he's meant to be the human in the Aslan-Christ thing but STILL. Me? Relate to Edmund? Edmund? Really? Come on. But my little meme brain was like 'omg me' 'me' 'that's something I would say' 'literally me' and it was like -_- 
 This apparently is a new theme with rereads. Last time I read Anne's House of Dreams I related more to Miss Cornelia than anyone else and I'm just like ""Where did I go wrong in my life that this is my fate"" 
 Wait, I lied when I said that was my one last note, I have one very last note: and as much as I don't want this to be my last word on this book, if I conclude after this it will just be repeating myself about how magical and wonderful and perfect and transporting the journey of reading this book is, so this note will be my last word. Could your gender roles be any more traditional, Mr Lewis? I mean, you gave Peter a sword and you gave Lucy a vial of healing potion. You gave Susan a Horn to *call for help*. I mean. Yes, they're young. Yes. They are types. Yes, it's a children's book and none of the characters are really fleshed out. But jeez. Beavers can fight the enemy and girls can't? Come on, man. This is a Fantasy World. Anything Can Happen If You Let It (*cast of mary poppins pops up, singing*) 
 I cried on the last three pages of this book. I CRIED. It all wraps up way too fast. (also I was laughing at their funny medieval speak bc I find that stuff funny) I mean, they get to be kings and queens for like three hundred words and then BOOM hunting the white stag and then BOOM falling back out of the wardrobe. And I'm like 'Noooooooooo, don't do it, you'll end up back in England noooooo' but they always do. So disappointing. It's really no wonder that BOTH of my first memories of long-term devotion to creative writing projects were what I realize now is essentially Narnia fanfiction. I am just never ever ready to fall back out of the wardrobe as a little kid again. What a terrible fate."
4,"If there is one thing I've come to recognize about the Immortals After Dark books, is that they always begin with two sentient creatures of the Lore violently hating each other almost to the death. If it weren't for one claiming the other as his/her mate i.e ""Mine"", they would absolutely tear each other to pieces! Yes. In Dark Skye I have finally come to understand why this is so; making the romance hard earned and fun. It used to be that I hated all the contention but Kresley Cole is a writing genius. The fighting and bad behavior between two Loreans like Melanthe and Thronos is because of the Accession! The gods and goddesses are having a heydey, meanwhile, Nix the ever-knowing is playing matchmaker lol. Normally Vrekeners and Sorcerei do not belong together. I didn't get it until I read Dark Skye! Did anyone else get that about why the romance always started off volatile? In the first book, The Warlord Wants Forever, I understood it, I think, but as the series went on it became a troubling and monotonous theme. I didn't care what the reason was*shrugs."
4,"Cute 
 I've read this book for the 2nd time. 
 I loved reading it ! 
 What I love about M. Malone books are : 
 that her characters in her books have different ethnicities and that the Mc's /brothers all have different types of woman they like (blond ,redhead ,brunette, black ,white, biracial ). 
 I loved Tank/Tanner hotheaded Alpha Male . 
 Emma was likeable and very sweet 
 they complemented each other very well."
5,"Oh wow... dd not expect that (since I never even read the synopsis) but in a good way. I also really liked that they were both far from perfect, and Bebe and DeNice. At least I think that's what their names are :)."
4,"I'm weaving between a 4 and a 5-star rating. I settled on a four because of the beginning and because I figured out the ending within the first few chapters. I'm not talking about the hook--that was marvelous--but after it, the first few chapters of leaving rehab and returning to home life. I think if it started with home life post-rehab, the story would have been more powerful. As the novel progressed and we see how Sophie's addicted not just to pain killers but to Mina, it's really beautiful. The simplicity of their relationship, mostly in innuendos with one, passionate night, was tragic. 
 I still keep staring at that 5-star rating. It's tempting. Sharpe's sensory details are so utterly wonderful, ""down, down, down, salt, silk."" Just wow. 
 It was nice to see a good portrayal of bisexuality in a YA novel. There were a lot of great parts in this. Shockingly, I liked all of the characters involved. It was hard at first to get into the mother's mindset, but soon it evened out. I also loved that Sophie's parents are clearly very accepting of her bisexuality and that it's not an issue with her friends. 
 Definitely would recommend this. Can we say 4.5 stars? That it'd be a 5-star rating if the novel started just a tad bit later? Yes? No?"
4,"Yay finally a memorable book I can recommend to my friends after I've been in a terrible book slump! 
 I absolutely loved Behind Closed Doors and felt this book mirrored that one very similarly. 
 In her previous book, I left this comment in my review: 
 I usually get super irritated with weak characters because I put myself in their shoes and I'm usually like ""I WOULD NEVER DO THAT WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?!"" 
 And weirdly, I felt the same about this book! Obviously Cass is an unstable character and you watch her progress throughout the story from someone that might have it together, to someone that you have to question regularly. There were times I was like ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!"" 
 Is she a weak character? Not necessarily. But there were many parts that I was getting frustrated with her and that's a good sign that BA Paris was doing her job. She wrote Cass very well and even though some moments lagged (okay there was a point in the middle of the story where I was waiting for something BIG to happen instead of seeing Cass spiral out of control), but STICK WITH IT! It's definitely worth the chance and even if your patience is tested, like mine is when I see a character losing it or going crazy, the ending definitely makes up for it. 
 Aaaand a spoiler just because: 
 (view spoiler)[To some, the ending might seem far fetched, but I didn't see it coming (probably should have). I really liked how the twist unraveled through text messages. I also liked that after finding out Rachel did in fact kill Jane and Rachel was having an affair with Matthew, it wasn't written in that Cass ended up with John. That would be too much of a happy ending and I'm glad it didn't go that route and left it open. (hide spoiler)] 
 This is definitely a favorite for the year 2017 so far. Can't wait to tell my friends to read this one."
4,"Another awesome installment! 
 Review To Come!!"
4,"I loved the first half of this book... I kept thinking '5 star', '5 star'! And then came the romance - when both main characters got together - and I just sort of lost interest. (There were chapters where nothing but 'I like you', lets be in love, happened.) Yeah, I know I'm weird. And the ending was okay, it sets the book up for a sequel, although it's still a happy ending. Anyway, because I lost interest it took me months to finish this book, literally. So this book that some people will love, I'm sure, gets four stars. 
 Willow is a great main character - and mechanic! - and she faces some pretty big changes in this book, the least of which perhaps is dealing with the fact that she's half angel. You see, every other angel in the world wants her dead. And then there's Alex. A boy supposedly working for a secret branch of the government, a train assassin (suspend disbelief) who can't figure out whether he should kill her or kiss her. :) The narrator switches between these two main characters, giving you insight into the lives and feelings of both. Alex could have been easy to dislike. He is an assassin. Instead, it's easy to sympathise with him. You get quite a bit of background information about his character and it's released in tantalising glimpses. 
 I learnt quite a bit about American geography in this book, because it involves a lot of travelling! We also meet lots of different characters - from mechanics to high school students. L. A. Weatherly has a great talent for making these people feel real to you. This is a tale of a battle between good and evil, right and wrong, for the future of mankind. So it's very important that the reader learns to care about it characters and to start to understand them; L. A. Weatherly's book succeeds in this. 
 The lagging in the pace of the book upon the 'cabin' scenes (for those of you who have read the book) made me disengage with this book and I stopped caring about the rest of the plot. I guess I got my happy ending too soon. 
 There's something for everyone in this book. An interesting, strong and gifted female character, romance, action, mystery, and angels. It's a pretty cool premise and there are good guys, bad guys and 'grey' guys. This book is pretty much a great catch. I just didn't like the last 1/3 very much, I got bored."
2,"I was really looking forward with the story since it's sectioned in my favorite genre. Perhaps because of that enthusiasm I've expected a lot and my expectations are not met in all levels. The only thing that I love is when I finally finished it so I can move on to another book. 
 (view spoiler)[ I actually love it when she's craving for blood. I was hoping it would give me some action. But it didn't (to think she's so powerful they say). Supporting characters were patronizing her powers too much but she failed to give me some vampiric moves/action. What's the mark if there's no action? (hide spoiler)] 
 Despite that thank you for this beautiful quote, ""But remember, darkness does not always equate to evil, just as light does not always bring good."" 
 I believe that cliches are cliches for a reason that it will eventually make me like it. But no, not in this book. I guess this book just wasn't for me."
5,Holy crap! This series is going to stick with me FOREVER! I got extremely teary eyed while listening to the audio books. Kate Rudd did a spectacular performance of telling Rebecca Donavans story. This series is soul consuming gut wreching kind of love that everyone needs to have. EMMA AND EVAN FOREVER. I couldn't believe I had to wait over 1/3 portion of the book before we heard from Evan. I'm so glad we got to hear from his pov in this book. Gosh I want to hear more from these characters. I highly recommend it.
4,"This was a super great suspense novel taking place in a small suburban town, in the home of a family whose daughter is working toward her shot at the Olympics. Everything is fine and dandy until a death rocks the gymnastics community to which the main family belongs. I really liked how beautifully this story was told, especially when Katie thinks back on why things are the way they are: The Foot. The Fall. The Pit. Very intriguing. 
 It was also so nice that there were many discoveries to be made throughout the book, so you weren't just reading until the end for the reveal; there were many reveals all throughout the book, which made it rewarding to get to. I think this community worked a lot better than the one in Dare MeDare Me as well (also written by Megan Abbott), possibly because everyone is much more familiar with how cut-throat the world of gymnastics is, and the fact that they didn't really seem like the competitive cheerleaders in Dare Me, so it was kind of odd to me when the girls got soooo intense with the arrival of the new coach. I think too You Will Know Me was strengthened by the story being told by the star gymnast's mother, who the reader could relate to more because she, like us, felt like she was one step removed from all the action. It also gave Abbott a chance to explore the family dynamics from someone more wise and experienced than Devon. Baby brother Drew definitely stole the show for me. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a thriller-y type of book!"
4,I love these super-short stories of Howey's.
4,"The Cove tells a story of superstition and prejudice in a small town in the Appalachians during World War I. A young girl and her brother live isolated lives in a cove. When a injured, bedraggled man needs their help, they take him in. His presence brings help and hope, but there is more to his story than he shares with them. The Cove is excellent historical fiction. Cautions: some language and discreet sex."
5,"What a delightful romp! This novel combines all the lavish glamour of the Gatsby world with the drama and scandal of your favorite Bravo series (not that Gatsby was without its scandals;). While not without her faults, I immediately saw the protagonist Katey as the most level-minded of all her crazy acquaintances -- but then she would pull some awesome antic and jazz up the lives of those around her. Full of ambition and spunk, I loved the characters she met and odd jobs she completed. After the excellent revelation at the end, I thought over some of the previous scenes with new clarity. Recommended for: those nostalgic for the days -- and adventures -- of the past."
5,"A ROGUE BY ANY OTHER NAME is the first book of Sarah MacLean's Rules of Scoundrels series. The four books of the series tell the stories of four partners who have been exiled from society. The four are partners in a fabulous gaming hell known as the Fallen Angel. 
 Each book begins with the story of the fall from grace of each of the partners. In A ROGUE BY ANY OTHER NAME, we learn the story of Michael Lawler, Marquess of Bourne, who was orphaned at the age of 16. At the age of 21, he lost everything on a turn of the cards at vingt et un. Exiled from society, he has built a new life for himself as the games manager at the Fallen Angel. 
 The heroine of the story is Lady Penelope Marbury, who was the ex-fiance of the Duke of Leighton from ELEVEN SCANDALS TO START TO WIN A DUKE'S HEART. Penelope has spent the eight years since her broken engagement searching for the kind of love that the Duke found in that book. She and Michael were friends when they were growing up, but she hasn't seen him in 16 years. 
 ""[T]hey'd been friends once. Long ago, before he'd become handsome as the devil and twice as cold."" 
 The two meet again because Penelope's father has acquired a portion of Bourne's family estate and Bourne wants it. He compromises her and forces their marriage. 
 This book is much darker than MacLean's previous Love By Numbers Series. Bourne is a dark, cold man when the book begins. He doesn't try to disguise his motives but rather takes what he wants. What he wants is his land and revenge on the man who took everything from him. Bourne is obsessed with revenge and doesn't really care who gets hurt in the process. I confess that I like dark, sexy, tortured heroes. Bourne is definitely of the dark and tortured variety and he is a jerk a lot in this book. I like that though because I love that he is redeemed by his love for Penelope. 
 Penelope has grown and changed in the eight years since ELEVEN SCANDALS TO START TO WIN A DUKE'S HEART. I found it very interesting that it was the love story in that book that changed Penelope. It made her dissatisfied with the unemotional life that she had expected to live. It made her want love. I also really liked how strong Penelope is. Bourne tries to intimidate her and yet she refused to yield. Even when she cannot win against him, she is strong and makes the best deal she can. 
 I also really like that it is Penelope that is the heroine in the story. She is the one who takes the actions to help Bourne. She is the instigator of much of the movement in their relationship. She is the powerful one. 
 The secondary characters are strong and pull at the reader to know what their stories are. I also really enjoy that MacLean uses secondary characters from her other novels. It is always a nice surprise for a small character to make an appearance. The book also leaves small questions about the other partners in the series which makes me want to read the next book. 
 And speaking of the next book....This book has a fantastic epilogue that is really a prologue for ONE GOOD EARL DESERVES A LOVER."
5,"A truly strange fantasy. We're taken into the dark and hidden side of London. Neil Gaiman has really outdone himself in his Neverwhere. The villains were supremely vicious and heartless. One part that I enjoyed immensely was Richard's trial, and the doubt he eventually overcomes. 
 Overall this was a really fascinating book that is like no other. 
 Have fun reading. 
 Cheers Pretties!"
3,"3.5. It started off well and then it got weird. Some of the stories I liked better than the others and by the and it just got really really weird. 
 My advice make sure you really pay attention to what you're reading because it all comes back together somehow and I guess I wasn't paying enough attention. 
 So it won the Printz award but I think Eleanor & Park was better."
2,"This book suffers from some very seriously diminishing returns. Starts strong, with intriguing characters in an interesting setting. And then all of the action stops, and is replaced by endless description. Which is not per se a negative, but cinnamon rolls and the world being a strange and terrible place can't sustain hundreds of pages when there are no recipes and the strange and terrible is inconsistent and repercussions never manifest."
4,"I put off reading this novel as long as I did, no matter how many of my friends recommended it to me, because I really hated the title. 
 I still hate the title. But I loved the book. The Guernsey Literary Society would actually have been quite a good name for the book, but I suppose the editor (and perhaps the author) felt that was too intellectual and intimidating-sounding. Instead they came up with this twee (sorry, Britons, to appropriate your word, but it's really the best one) title that's excessively long, difficult to remember (and say), and extremely difficult to say without rolling your eyes. 
 However, leaving the title, the book was an enjoyable read. It seems people here either loved it or really hated it. It is a sunshine-y type of a book about fairly happy people, but I would posit that that's just the way some stories (and people) are. Sometimes an edgy story is good, yes, but darkness and cynicism doesn't need to be injected into every story to make it ""real"" or ""believable."" Some things--like puppies and ducklings--are just warm and fuzzy. That doesn't make them any less valuable. 
 This book is short, sweet, and to be savored. There are wonderful witty bits, very dear characters, and you don't have to worry too much about the ending. That doesn't make for everyone's cup of tea, but it sure was exactly what I needed just then."
0,"** spoiler alert ** 
 Wow. Just loved this book. I'm not one for writing reviews, but I cried several times at the end of this book. First Buffy, then Lois (and Rick's pain just magnified it), then George. I can't wait to read the next one but part of me doesn't know how to keep going on after the losses. Which I suppose is part of the point. The whole world in Feed has gone on despite horrendous loss and tragedy. And so I have to continue too, if only to see how Shaun manages."
3,"Well, I read it in two sittings (less than 24 hours), so it must have been good. 
 Maddy has been ripped from her home in Boston by divorce to live in New Hampshire with her mother, sister, and grandmother. For Maddy, this is a true tragedy. She leaves her friends, who are all friendly goths who are into manga, for a land of ""Aberzombies."" Her grandmother insists that Maddy wear her grandmother's clothes to the first day of school, because she doesn't approve of Maddy's goth-wear, which results in a humiliating episode involving a unicorn sweatshirt, grandma-cut jeans, the most popular guy at the new school, and Maddy making a horrible first impression. 
 Then Maddy starts playing a WoW clone and things begin to look up. 
 I enjoyed this Cinderella story in goth/manga/gamer/high school clothing, although the ending was a bit pat. Great cover, and some of the references will be dated almost immediately (there is no end to brandname and technology references, which is always dangerous in print material). But at the moment, it's in. :)"
4,"Will & Hanna.... 
 I was so excited to read Will's story. I have quickly grown to love three best friends- Bennett (my numero uno), Max (his accent does wonders to the imagination) and now Will (his intelligence & wisdom in the sack is just the icing on the cake). 
 I think this story was rather unique, but with a pretty predictable plot and ending. There were moments in the book where I wanted to wring both Hanna & Will's necks, but overall, their cuteness, sexiness and humor pretty much swept that under the rug for me. 
 It was great incorporation of the rest of the gang and can't wait to read Beautiful Beginnings!!"
4,"This was a super fast read, not because it was short and lacked detail, on the contrary, at 343 pages it is what I would call a medium-weight book, and it held enough adventure and excitement to fill those pages quite nicely too. It was just so darn good, that I couldn't put it down. I kept thinking about it all day long as I toiled away at my desk working, then I'd jump on it as soon as the sun went down, and I'd be lost for the rest of the evening. 
 The current craze over Dystopia style novels is meaning more and more of this genre are being released to satisfy the hordes. ""Ashes, Ashes"", released in June 2011, is just one among many recent additions to this category. 
 We all know the childhood nursery rhyme: 
 Ring-a-ring-a-roses, 
 A pocket full of posies; 
 Ashes, Ashes 
 We all fall down. 
 Associated with the Great Plague in England in 1665, this is the first entry in Treggiari's novel Ashes, Ashes and is clearly in reference to a plague-like epidemic. In this case, the story follows sixteen year old Lucy surviving alone in the wilds left behind after New York was deliberately destroyed following an outbreak of Smallbox which killed 99% of the population world-wide. 
 Her struggle to live daily amongst wicked weather disturbances and unusual natural and man-made disasters is told from her perspective. After managing to exist on her wits alone, she is helped by another plague survivor when hunted down by a pack of hungry wild dogs. Eventually, she joins his commune and begins to fight for their survival as a unit. 
 This novel has it all, adventure, excitement, thrills, danger and romance. Exactly what you want in a decent Dystopic novel. I found it easy to read, it flowed well and before I knew it, I was well and truly wrapped up in Lucy's world and struggles. 
 As a protagonist, she sets a good example. She's a survivor, strong and capable, but Treggiari does manage to bring out the vulnerable in her character as well. Alone and barely existing, she seeks comfort and assistance from a group of likeable survivors, but does not loose herself when amongst them. 
 I enjoyed this book. I wouldn't say it was brilliant, I've read too many great and brilliant books of late to class this one amongst them, but I would gladly recommend it as a super Dystopian read. The only gripe I have about the entire book is the ending. It felt hurried and incomplete. I'm unsure if Treggiari plans a sequel, there is potential for it, but this book also felt as though it attempted to complete the story, but just missed. 
 Other than that, I have no complaints. It was a fun, fast paced read, quite enjoyable indeed. 
 So, what do I give Ashes, Ashes? 
 7/10: ""Good solid read, something to get your teeth into"" on the NBRS."
5,"Awesome story. 
 Lily is definitely an awesome character; she knows what she wants and she isn't concerned with what people might think. Right from the beginning she could be summed up in three different activities; she was either smoking opium, having sex and running from people who tried to kill her. So yeah, I suppose that left little room for anything but an awesome character. (view spoiler)[I felt a bit sad for her towards the end when Sal leaves without letting her explain, and I felt like we weren't going to see him again until in the sequel, so I was damn happy he was there at the end to give Lily her parachute and a happy ending for the two. It made it easier to sleep afterwards. (hide spoiler)] 
 I love the whole steampunk aspect of the book; the airships, the tinkers, the mechanics everywhere. It's not all that well explained in the details but we still understand it perfectly just through the way the elements are inserted into the story. 
 (view spoiler)[Downside; in the beginning Celeste makes such a big deal about how only a Temenos can find the statue but throughout their quest I don't once get the feeling that that is really as important as she made it out to be. I'm pretty sure someone else with the kaleidoscope could have found it as well. (hide spoiler)] 
 Looking forward to the next two books!"
3,"Review found at http://www.nightlyreading.wordpress.com 
 I have read a lot of reviews for this book, some good, some bad. It did not deter me from taking a chance and seeing for myself. I really loved the storyline, although, it reminded me a lot of Delirium. 
 Cassia is a young girl getting ready for her matched banquet. She lives in a society that everything is controlled for them. The government decides whom they are matched with, what their job is and even what they eat. When it is her turn to be called to see her match on the big screen, the screen is blank for a few moments. Just as she is starting to panick, she is surprised by the image that shows up. She is matched with Xander, her best friend. Everyone else is just as surprised as she is, it is not a usual practice that you get matched with someone who lives in your neighborhood, let alone, someone you know. 
 The government issues a microcard on the day of the match banquet. Usually, it is for those whom do not know each other. The microcard gives background information on each person so that their match can get to know them a little better. Cassia puts off looking at Xander's card, after all, she already knows him. But, she wants to see if there is anything that she does not know. She slips the card into the machine and poof, the face staring back at her is not Xander, but someone else she knows, Ky Markham. It only lasts for a moment before the screen goes black and Xander's face replaces Ky's. 
 Cassia loves Xander, but now she is having feelings for Ky too! She needs to figure out her feelings and do it without the society finding out. 
 The book did not grab me like I had thought that it would. I had to go all the way to chapter 18 before I got really interested. The storyline was really great and I would never want to live in a society like that. I will continue to read the series, I am curious what happens with Cassia and her love triangle. 
 The next book in the series Crossed is due out in November 2011. 
 3.5 Stars!"
5,"Such a beautiful story.. Of course the little love story was AMAZING, but getting to see more dimensions of Mistress Coyle was very.. intriguing. This little novella made me even MORE anxious to see how Monsters of Men plays out."
4,"I think this book was a wonderful start to the spin off series, Shadowhunter Academy. I'm so excited that we get to learn more about Simon as he starts this new journey! 
 The characters in it seem wonderful, and I'm excited to learn about them."
1,"I thought the protagonist was far whinier than he needed to be. I am interested to read it again after having seen Six Degrees of Separation starring Stockard Channing, Donald Sutherland, Will Smith, and Anthony Michael Hall. Highly recommend the movie, not so much the book that is mentioned in passing in the movie."
5,"This was a pretty good short story about a man named Vlad who is a Vampire but tries to be a normal person. Can he hide who he truly is though? Read on to find out for yourself. 
 If you like Vampire stories, definitely go read this story here: http://www.tor.com/2014/10/29/a-kiss-..."
5,"The first time I read this novella I liked it but I didn't love it like I do now after re-reading it and I knwo why was that... Soren! 
 You'll wonder why if this novella is all about Nora and one mission for Kingsley... But it's all about Nora missing Soren even if she doesn't wanna admit it, not much anyway. 
 ---- 
 I found the perfect Kingsley"
3,"Actual rating: 3,5 
 First I want to say that I have to reread this book in order to give it a fair review. I just want to get down some notes here in the meantime: 
 I liked Rhi. She might seem a bit Mary Sue with her being beautiful but not aware of it or whatever, but I liked her, and she is independent, which I LOVE about her. I actually do love that the male (well, I can't help but think of A as male, I'm sorry) is the weak one for once. I like their flawed, impossible romance, and I love how it ends. 
 On the other hand, I don't like how David seemed to take different plots and run them alongside each other. The romance, which is a bit of a fluff, the complications with Nathan, which for a long time just is A checking A's e-mail, and then the COMPLETELY UNRESOLVED, BARELY BEGUN new plot with the pastor(?). I feel like there should be another 200 pages digging into that plot. There really isn't that much happening in the book. I feel like David here plays too much on one, simple idea (A switching bodies and discovering people's lives) and on the always trying to find Rhi. I think I would like if A didn't fall in love so fast, and rather spent more time forgetting about her before meeting her again by chance. I do, however, really like some of the lives A is dragged into, that we get to observe. 
 Ah, I like that Rhi is less warm towards A when A is female. It does make sense. And that Rhi doesn't manage to adapt to this whole thing. That too makes sense. I don't see how she could have been in love with A as A, considering A DOESN'T HAVE A PERSONALITY (almost). 
 Oh, and there's the thing about A always waking up in the same American state. That doesn't make any sense at all, and wouldn't it be a lot more fun if A could end up anywhere? 
 As I said, I need to reread before I can give a better, more detailed review. I truly apologize if anything I have stated as a fact is incorrect."
5,"4.5 for this one. 
 I haven't read a book I enjoyed as much as this one, in a seriously long time. 
 I love reading science fiction, but I'm not a science-y person and my math skills are pretty sad so when I started reading this and got to the part where Mark was figuring out what he needed to grow potatoes... I started having flashbacks to when I read Heinlein as a teen, and the paragraphs upon paragraphs of math formulas. 
 But thankfully Weir, kept it to a nice combination of interesting and cool, making me wish I was better at that stuff. 
 I loved Mark and I totally believed it was possible for someone like him to survive that long on Mars. Every set-back for him, and by NASA had me worried he wasn't going to make it. I have to add that I liked that it wasn't an over the top amount of set-backs considering the main one of just being there was a doozy enough. 
 I have only a small quibble and that was that the ending was so abrupt feeling. Thinking about it though, I think Mark's story ended where it needed to, but the tenseness of the scenes leading up to that point, needed a little more time to wind down before we said goodbye. That's just a thought and by no means something that should keep anyone from giving this book a try, it was well worth the read. 
 I'm going to lend it to my daughter next. 
 Great book!"
4,"I got this book for a dollar from a library sale (one of my favourite places to buy books!) and I'm certainly glad I did. 
 I had already seen The Maze Runner movie but it didn't really impede or hinder my enjoyment of the book. If anything, I enjoyed the book more because it was more clear than the movie. 
 It's a bit of a reverse-Lord of the Flies in that rather than descend into feral chaos, the teenage boys have a complex society that allows them to survive with a sense of order and give them a way to escape the giant maze that holds them prisoner. 
 The writing for The Maze Runner was much more taut and well paced than I expected and I was pleasantly surprised. There are no pages you muddle through hoping to get to more exciting parts."
4,"TWO BLONDES by Charlaine Harris 
 3 Stars 
 Cute story! Pam continues to shine and the more I read about her the more I LOVE her. 
 ONE FOR THE MONEY by Jeaniene Frost 
 5 stars 
 Jeaniene Frost continues to deliver AMAZING stories about Cat & Bones in this short. We even get a to see Justina soften up a little and help Bones! Great addition to the series and it's just enough to hold me over until the next book comes out."
4,"These books get better & better in my opinion! City of Ashes, to me was an absolute cliffhanger! The whole Simon saga, the forbidden love, Jocelyn in a coma, Luke (him & Clarys father-daughter thing is adorable) and of course, Valentine just had me gasping at every page. Honestly loved it! It blew City of Bones out of the water, I read this one in about a day & a half. With City Of Glass which I'm currently reading, it seems these books just keep getting better!"
5,One of the most powerful books I've ever read. Such a simple concept... Diary entries written by a retarded man who gets an operation to make him into a genius. I cried when it was over.
2,The only thing I liked about this book were the drawings.
3,"More like 3.5 stars. 
 LIKED: 
 * Daniel and Violet were fun characters. I especially liked Violet's resourcefulness and practicality. She can think fast on her feet in an impressive variety of situations. 
 * Because of some lingering trauma from her past, Violet is hesitant about physical intimacy. Daniel has to take it slow or risk her running away. The gentleness and sweetness of the buildup was really sexy and fun to read. 
 * The supporting cast of characters didn't overwhelm the story and was probably a nice catch-up session for those who have read other books in this series (I have not). 
 LIKED LESS: 
 * Violet's social status is ridiculously below Daniel's. Very brief mention is made of it but ultimately, there are zero repercussions for the hero and heroine breaking convention in such an outrageous fashion. 
 * While I don't want to minimize anyone's pain, Daniel's confessions of his past troubles come across as very ""poor little rich boy,"" especially when compared to Violet's trauma and poverty. 
 * While the supporting cast of characters didn't overwhelm the story, in some cases, I think they eased the way a little too much. I don't want my hero & heroine tortured at ridiculous lengths to be together, but I also feel that having to triumph over struggle makes the Happily Ever After that much more satisfying. This HEA lacked some oomph because Violet and Daniel didn't have to push as hard to get there. 
 Overall, a fun romance with a slow sexy courtship but too easy of a resolution."
4,"FOUR STARS FOR TEARS OF TESS (MONSTERS IN THE DARK BOOK 1) BY PEPPER WINTERS 
 ""Three little words. I was sold."" 
 Those words set the tone of the entire story and I was immediately invested, eager to learn all that had led Tess to her despair and the kind of fight she would have to endure in order to pull herself free. 
 While on holiday in Mexico with her boyfriend Brax, Tess Snow, a young Australian university student, found herself thrown in a nightmare filled with violence, humiliation and the loss of free will. On a scooter excursion through the seaside streets of Cancun, Brax and Tess stumble upon an old, dilapidated cafe. Desperate for a reprieve from the heat and a drink to soothe his thirst, Brax is insistent the stop is essential before continuing on their journey. Hesitantly, Tess follows him inside where they order drinks from a suspicious looking woman. As they're waiting for their sodas, Tess is gripped with an unwelcoming feeling of dread. Unable to explain her mind's eerie thoughts, she slowly scans around the seedy establishment and catches the woman being manhandled by an angry male. Brax, completely unaware of the tension emanating from Tess, excuses himself to go to the restroom- after taking a sip of his coke, which had just been placed in front of him by the woman behind the counter. Protesting his decision, Tess tried to reason with him to wait and pleaded for a quick departure. Still unfazed by any hint of danger walks out of sight, leaving his young girlfriend alone in the cafe. As Tess continues to take in her surroundings, her terrorizing thoughts slowly come to life as the door is suddenly blocked by three men. Instincts taking over, she tries to escape, screaming for Brax and impressively fights her would-be captors. Outnumbered and outmatched, Tess is soon knocked out, gaining consciousness in a large vehicle hands bound and in the company of other frightened young women. 
 Over the next several days, Tess constantly battles her jailers, her abusers; her spirit- she formulates escape plans only to acquiesce to the brutal fists of the men imprisoning her. As if she were an animal on a farm, Tess is branded with a tattoo of a barcode on her wrist and implanted with a tracking device behind her ear. A warning is given, she can either adapt to her new life and be sold to a master who will cherish her or continue to fight and end up beaten and broken with death as her only refuge. Tess vows that a harsh reckoning will befall all her captors, keeping the fire burning in her soul. 
 ""One day, you will suffer as your victims suffer. One day, Karma will come and bite your ass."" 
 Suddenly, Tess is whisked away after being informed that she has been sold. She is again rendered unconscious and wakes up hooded, bound by her wrists and ears popping from a descending aircraft. Hurriedly, she is thrust into the arms of another male who Tess deduces will be the one to deliver her to her new owner. Her hood is removed and she sees the initials ""QM"" on the side of a private jet. As her new guards try to load her into the plane, she runs barefoot in a desperate attempt to flee her new life. Aching and bruised from the beatings she received while in Mexico, Tess is unable to resist when she is forcibly tackled and heaved into the jet. Once again, she finds herself without power or any means of escape. 
 Filled with anger and resistance, Tess refuses to bow down or submit to her new reality or her new ""master."" Q Mercer was unlike the brutish and heinous men who tormented her in Mexico He was unlike her docile and handsome Brax. In Q, Tess saw a man with power and a carefully hidden vulnerability. He had good looks and a well built physique. Q held cruelty in his eyes yet possessed the ability to look at her with guilt, regret and pain. He was a man of extreme contradictions and Tess had an immediate and unwanted attraction to him. In a large manor in France, Tess Snow realized her greatest battle did not take place in her unfulfilled years in Australia, nor did it occur in her time spent with sadistic men in Mexico. No, the greatest battle of her life and her spirit would be taking place in a French manor with a man who threatened to break her down in order to own her mind, body and soul. 
 The rest of the story is a constant push and pull between Q and Tess. There always seems to be a deep rooted internal struggle inside Q Mercer which tears at Tess, twisting her already complicated myriad of emotions. There's a few important points which lead the pair down paths they seem to be conflicted to travel through. Will they be able to overcome the pain that cloaks them in darkness or will they search a way to shatter the restraints of their psyche and find comfort and solace with one another. 
 Tears of Tess delves into the grueling battle of opposing desires for both our heroine and our antihero. It was fascinating to go through the constant tearing of Q and Tess's inner selves. Their needs ran so parallel yet they often found themselves on opposite ends of the battlefield. One moment, they would share a closeness and a bond so strong and impenetrable and the next, there would be a great divide that clawed at their already frayed spirits. 
 Tess struggled with the sense that for the first time in her life, she felt as if she belonged somewhere to someone. She had a place where she felt free though still bound by the invisible chains of Q's ownership. How could she feel so comforted by a man who held her captive? 
 Q struggled with demons from a past he longed to forget and a dark hunger he found difficult to bury. A task which became impossible as soon as Tess Snow walked through the doors of his manor. There was a closely guarded secret which Q kept hidden from Tess which would shed light into how he became the man he is today. 
 Pepper Winters did a phenomenal job of writing two characters with so much depth and complex emotion that I know I'll find myself thinking about them long after I type the last word into my review.I Tears of Tess isn't so much a dark read as it is a look into the shadowed world we sometimes place ourselves in. It pushed me to examine certain aspects of my own life I may have closed off in order to conform to the will and expectations of our society entails. For the added benefit of debating a good moral dilemma on top of a story with great heroes and sensual scenes, I gave this first book in the Monsters in the Dark Series four stars and I would highly recommend this for all to read. 
 I received this ARC in exchange for an honest review.

4,"*DO NOT READ THIS BEFORE YOU READ ALL OF THE VAMPIRE ACADEMY BOOKS. BLOODLINES WILL SPOIL THE BOOKS IN THAT SERIES.* 
 I just want to say something before I review this book. I feel like my ratings are harsher than they use to be, and I think that's because I've read so many books in this genre that it's hard not to compare one book to the others. The thing is I couldn't stop myself from comparing Bloodlines to Vampire Academy so please don't hate me if you think I compare them too much. 
 I think Bloodlines has the potential to become a great series. I don't think it lived up to the high exceptions the hype for the series created though. If I didn't have such high exceptions for this book at first, I think I would have liked it more because it was a really good book. It had the right elements of a paranormal book series, and Richelle Mead executed those elements well. She's a great writer, and I love her writing voice. She's witty, smart, and she still includes those petty high school dramas that some people actually go through. For example, one second Sydney is this professional Alchemist, and the next second she's trying to figure out the social cues in high school. 
 People should still read because even though it may be under the shadow of Vampire Academy, it's still a good book by itself. I should get better as the series goes on. That's what happened with Vampire Academy. 
 I like how in this series we learn more about the Alchemists and spirit users because when Mead finished Vampire Academy, spirit users were only just then coming out publicly, and still didn't know much about them. 
 I almost wanted to hurt Mead for making another spirit bond because I though we were through with that, but if it helps us learn something we don't know about spirits bonds already, I guess I could forgive her. 
 (view spoiler)[I'm so excited Dimitri is going to be in the next one. I can't wait to see Adrien go head to head. I love them both, and I hope they can get past their differences. 
 I'm glad Sydney hired a hit on the jackass rapist Keith. I would have told, but I'm glad she took out his eye. (hide spoiler)]"
4,A+ banter. What more can you ask for.
5,"Good ending to an already great book. I'm still partial to ""The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle"" as his best book so far, but I enjoyed this book from beginning to end. I also have to admit that every time I read Murakami I feel the urge to have japanese food, which is unfortunate in a country where all I find are California Rolls and Wakame. 
 (view spoiler)[ My only nag: Was I the only one thinking that the push between Tengo and Aomame to find each other was a little too much for people who haven't met in so many years? (hide spoiler)]"
2,"I really enjoyed this book until I got about halfway through, then I just lost all interest in it. I never actually finished it, it just never grabbed me - or rather it did, but didn't do anything with it in the end. Maybe someday I'll pick it up again and finish it, but for now it sits in the ""books I thought I'd like, and kind of did until I didn't"" pile."
4,"This book goes beyond being a classic, it began a whole new theme/meme/storyline of science out-of-control. 
 That said, it made for a very interesting re-read; I'd read it as a teenager, and recently read it again for book club. 
 First person POV story told from the captain of the ship headed to the North Pole, embedded within which is the story of Victor Frankenstein, told in first person POV, embedded within which is the story of the monster, told in first person POV - I don't think that would fly, in a modern novel, and it's somewhat clunky here. 
 Also, to a modern reader, the language may seem rather flowery and verbose, but I'm guessing to a reader in 1831 it was fairly tight, with a page count in my version of under 250. Certainly there isn't the endless digressions on barely related subjects as in Moby Dick or Les Miserables. 
 Shelley hits the requisite points - chills and horror, especially in the first scene where the monster is standing by the bed? Yes. Sympathy for the captain, Frankenstein, the monster, and all associated parties? Yes. 
 Of them all, it is hardest to feel sympathy for Frankenstein. Why doesn't he TELL someone, or ask for help? People - people he theoretically loves - are dying because he is too proud/ashamed to confess what he did, until the end when he tells the sea captain. But this IS a recurring theme of human nature, people continue to behave this way, so it's a faithful reflection of human frailty. 
 IMO, this is one of the books that every literate person should read at least once."

 Right! Who starts an FB thread without even thinking of the consequences? Me! But the difference here was when Give Me Yesterday was posted; the responses were totally unexpected and even more amazing. After reading our followers opinions, I had to one-click. Who wouldn't? All said and done, a freebie is a freebie! The comments were as such that a follower and myself decided to buddy read it. Bless her--my good manners were blown to the wind when I couldn't even wait for her to catch up with me. Ma'am, if you're reading this, you know who you are and please accept my sincerest apologies, but this story sucked me into such an extent that coming up for air was on no account, an option. K. Webster and co writer, Elle Christensen, are new authors to me. Why I haven't crossed paths with them before is beyond me; however, to this day, I will never forget their written words. 
 Firstly, having a full box of tissues at hand wouldn't be a bad idea because it's not so much an ugly cry as a constant-emotional-roller-coaster of feeling which has no let up, room for interruptions or better said, life's mundane chores. Secondly, even though it's a page-turner of a standalone, flipping the pages as fast as you can won't be enough. You'll need to savour the story, try and suss out why the male protagonist is holding back and why his female counterpart is named the 'ice queen', feared by all and reluctant to let go of her past. On very rare occasions does my premonition fail me but in this story, it did big time! Why, you may ask! Well, it's certainly not your stereotype heartbreaker novel; it is so much more. 
 Realistically narrated in present tense, the chapters are either from Victoria Larkin's point of view or from the gorgeous Dr. Chase Monroe's. For me, the comparison of their stories was like looking at a harshly dealt hand of cards...and no matter how much I shuffled them, the result seemed to be the same... and I was petrified of the result! I'd even go as far as saying it was destiny playing tricks with them. But these two people come together under unusual circumstances, so I went along with the story and devoured the hell out of it; notwithstanding, what was on the horizon could never have been envisaged and this is where I have to give kudos to the authors. My utter devastation was indescribably mapped out in a plot which left me spent, sobbing and cursing the authors to kingdom come. Two damaged people and longing for them to find peace of mind is exactly what their individual stories are about. 
 I hate spoilers and although they have no room or substance here, a few things have to be mentioned. Tori, aka Victoria is an A 1 b$tch. Successful, driven and about to be at the top of her career, she is given an ultimatum. Mistakes aren't permitted. She makes a big one. Blinkin' heck. . . I loved to hate her, felt sorry for her, fell hard for her and even swore I'd never have anything to do with her all at the same time! Until...until this reader was out of her depth with her sufferance. It became mine. It will become yours. 
 Chase melted my heart. Deary me... the authors' descriptive writing is as such that I wanted to be there; in fact, I was in his thoughts, in his very being. The beauty of this story is the way the authors have construed his past. It is very vague and has you on tenterhooks throughout. The ominous punch came when I least expected it to. It is devastating and not only caused sheer shock, I thought that everything he'd worked hard to achieve regarding Tori's problems was lost. Following his obsession with colours and the type of flowers he needed wasn't enough to give me a hint of what had happened. 
 Sublime character development, a strong storyline and the protagonists' back stories makes for an unforgettable read that'll be difficult to ignore. I'd love to see this book in paperback on my shelf. What more can I say except BRAVO to Ms Webster and Ms Christensen!"
4,"Lovely, sad. I'll be handing this out when the schools get to historical fiction. (Verse novels are very popular. I choose not to speculate on why.)"
5,"Wow WOW wow ... 5 amazing stars ... 
 I really liked it so much ...1000 times better than the first one 
 Full of actions and emotional events ... I could not put it down ... ... but in the end I wanted more of it.. 
 I Can not wait for the next book"
2,"There are so many problems with this book. It's just a big mished up mash of Cool Girl from Gone Girl with about 40 other ""issues"" ranging from homophobia to bullying to rape to eating disorders shoehorned in there. Yeah... I know. The person to take all this on is a sarcastic, CONSTANTLY label dropping poser who writes sex tips for a magazine and is struggling to make her way into the upper echelons of Manhattan society. It goes over about as convincingly as expected. 
 It's written to be consumed in one big gulp and that's exactly what I did, then felt slightly sick to my stomach. All in a lazy Sunday evening."
3,"I was first skeptical about the scenarios presented in regard to Lady Calpurnia's list, as highly improbable, however, once I decided to just ""let it go"" and simply enjoy the story, I found myself highly entertained."
4,"I'm an anthology junkie. They are the perfect way for me to find new for me authors and read something fun in the time it takes for a dentist appointment. I thought the concept of this anthology was fun and couldn't wait to dig in and find a few treasures. 
 I enjoyed quite a few of the stories in this anthology. It was a great addition to my collection. I appreciated the unique approaches the different authors took the theme of people in the medical field and created such diverse stories, excellent editing from Dreamspinner Press. There were patients, doctors, therapists, and every other combination. Who doesn't like a man in a lab coat? 
 Some of the highlights were: 
 S.C. Wynne's Doctor in the Desert. About a cop and a doc. finding common ground, respect, and each other. 
 Bru Baker is always solid and Rx for Sex was no exception. Although not a funny read like some, it was incredibly full of emotion and was artfully written. I was lost from the first scene to the last. A beautiful story. 
 Iron man by Meg O'Brian was awesome and different. The story is about a blind man and his neighbors son. It was refreshing and new. 
 Right-hand Man by Rob Rosen was funny and sexy and completely impractical, but I laughed the entire time. 
 Pain Management was fantastic. A story about a man who suffers from terrible migraines and is going through pain management and part of that is massage. It was believable and well done. 
 Most of these stories are full of wit and and joy at new love. Some like Bru's are about a love rekindled. All of them are worth a read. A solid set of stories and I know you will find a new author for you to grab, just like I did.

They had better be happy at least some of the time. This one ... it starts with the character not being happy and it seems like it was setting up for her to spend a lot of time around manipulative jerks. Not what I am in the mood for right now."
5,"WOW. Loved it. It's cold, intense and entertaining. 
 After Ghost Story this book heats up things to an another level. Since Harry is now more powerful in a different way, there are some hardcore stuff. Many times magic awed me. 
 Loved Harry's summonings of the Faeries, his travel to their land. For a long time I wanted to know more about immortals. This book is a treat. Getting to know more about Demonreach, other beings and even Faeries are enjoyable. Hope to see more of Kringle and Lacuna. Marsters does so well for Lacuna's accent. 
 The storyline surprised me. Jim weaves it so very well. He is a great author. Having read KKC I second Pat's view of Jim's writing. He makes it not only interesting but gives us something that we'll enjoy even during future reads. 
 During the end as details become clear I was banging my head wishing for something (like Harry) not to happen. Jim you never ceases to surprise me. Loved it how he solves the mystery so very well. 
 Incredible to see the development of Molly. She is a breath of fresh air and the magic is different to Harry's. 
 And Mouse <3. Missed his part in the last book. 
 Jim's jokes are yet again well-timed and hilarious. Marsters does quite a job in conveying them with proper tone. 
 On James Marsters - 
 Perfect job. Stresses sentences, words appropriately and makes me visualise easily. Magic spells don't sound well without him."
1,"*1.5 
 I didn't really enjoy it, but I don't think it's a terrible book or anything, just very mediocre for this genre. I'm very disappointed by this book, but I guess I could see why other people like it. I have a feeling like this review will be quite long, so bear with me. 
 Plot- Going into this book, I thought the plot didn't sound very unique. Now being finished with this book, I can say that it wasn't. The only real unique thing I found in this book was the mystery aspect of who was the prince and who was the assassin. I think it was an interesting idea, but I wasn't really a fan of it. I'll talk about that more specifically in the characters section though. Some could say the magic system/religious system of the story was unique, and I guess in a way it was, but not really. It was never really explained & I felt the little excerpts between some chapters didn't add anything either. To me, it didn't feel any different than any other religious system in a fantasy. I know this is the first book in a series, so it could be extrapolated later on, but I think it should've been explained more in this book, if it wanted to convince me that it was anything special. The world building was okay, but again, it didn't strike me as anything I haven't seen before. Now, all of this isn't a ""bad"" issue, it's just an ""average"" issue. If those were the only issues with the plot, I would've been able to overlook that, because a lot of fantasy can look the same. I couldn't overlook it though, because the plot didn't go anywhere. It's almost 500 pages, and I feel like 3 things happened in those 500 pages. I have never been so bored while reading, I honestly had to force myself to read (skim sometimes). I don't understand why this book was so long, because I feel like nothing ever happened. I was never engaged, and really the only reason I kept reading was to figure out who was who. You'd also think there would be a feeling of suspense in this book, considering the ""main plot"", but I did not feel any suspense at all. Once the climax happens, and it's revealed, I thought things would pick up, and they did, for like two chapters. Then nothing happened again, until the very last chapter, where it left us on a cliffhanger. Sometimes I can overlook slow plots, if a book has good characters, but that leads me to the next section. 
 Characters- As I said above, sometimes I can overlook a slow plot if there's really good characters. In this book, I did not care about a single character, really. I did not become attached, or connected with anybody. None of them felt unique what-so-ever, and I could'nt have cared less what happened to them. I did not like Pauline, or the way her character was written. She seemed so cliche and her actions at times didn't seem to match the way she was described, or with the way she previously acted. As a main protagonist, I really didn't like Lia, until the last 100 or so pages. Even by the end of the book, I still don't really like her, but I could see how she had some character development, and I did appreciate that. I thought at times she was witty, sassy, dangerous, and independent. So she wasn't my least favorite main character, but I only liked her in certain moments, not overall. Now, to the mystery boys, Rafe and Kaden. I don't have a favorite, because I don't really like either. There's not a particular reason why I don't like them, they just seemed so bland and ordinary. I don't really think either of them had good character development, because I don't think the only reason a character changed is because they ""fell in love"" justifies character development.As to the mystery of who was who...(view spoiler)[ I was wrong. I thought through the whole book that Rafe was the assassin, not Kaden. Now, this may be my conspiracy brain talking, but I think she wrote it that way. I don't think ""mystery"" was written in the right way, where once you know who's who you go look back & everything makes sense, and you can't believe you missed it. I think she wrote it so that most people would think it was Rafe, because that's what would make sense with the information that she gave us. I was shocked, but not really. (hide spoiler)] If you haven't read the book & can't read what's hidden under the spoiler tab, basically I don't think it was done very well. I don't think the little chapters from their perspectives added anything to the story as well, not until after we know who's the prince and who's the assassin. Before that though, all it added was thoughts about both of them loving her. Which now gets me into: The Love Triangle- I hate love triangles, I really do. Some people say this isn't a love triangle but I would consider it one. Although for most of the book Lia seems to prefer one over the other, they both have feelings for her, and I don't think it should be ruled out that Lia won't change her mind, as her thoughts have already started to waver. I find love triangles so annoying, and they frustrate me so much. I don't think they add anything what so ever. I'm not on a team because I don't really care who she chooses. 
 Writing- I feel like I'm negatively biased on this. I feel like because I wasn't enjoying the rest of the book, I made myself not like the writing either. I didn't necessarily not like it, it was just like everything else in this book for me, average. Being honest, it was probably a little above average, but it wasn't special. The description was good, but there was just something about it that didn't seem natural, it didn't have flow. Some books can keep me reading if I'm not enjoying anything else, just because the writing is easy to follow so I can fly through it. That wasn't the case with this one, I would read 20 pages and feel like I'd read 50. The writing wasn't my biggest issue with this book though, so I'll leave it at that. 
 Overall- I feel bad for not liking this book, as so many people are loving it. My overall impression was just- eh. I didn't think there was anything special about this book. It seemed to be just a cookie-cutter fantasy book. It seemed like they just went off of a checklist to write it. It's not bad to have a structure similar to others in the same genre, but I feel like the author didn't go anywhere with these elements, and just left them bland. I just couldn't get into the slow-paced plot. I was never really engaged in the story. I could see why some people like this, and obviously many do, so don't not read it just because of me. I don't think I will be recommending this, but if you are interested in reading it, give it a shot and see what you think."
4,"Very enjoyable first novel. 
 Some great ideas, some interesting characters (but also some over-used stereotypes), some logic holes. The Lives of Tao has very little to do with Taoism (as I had thought ...) and I can't shake the feeling that this was written in a rush without a second draft. 
 Overall reason enough to read the sequel, which I am doing right now."

 K, so way better than the previous book. Some sniffs occurred, but not too bad. Awesome action scene towards the beginning, not too bad love scenes, and a kind of shocker at the end..."

3,"Well-written, but ultimately the Mary Sue-ness of the main character and the increasing level of violence in the plot were rather off-putting. I get that the violence was part of the point of the story, but that doesn't mean I liked it or found it appropriately portrayed."
5,"Can't believe this was written long ago. It felt contemporary. I love how Philip inserted some really good laughs in between without distorting the ideas he wanted to present. I was able to deduce that I'm not an android because I was empathetic with most of the characters (especially the spider!). Great book. Now, lemme read more Philip K. Dick books.

3,"After falling in love with 
 The Iron Fey 
 series, of course I was bouncing with glee over a spin-off. A spin-off featuring a very grown up Ethan Chase, younger brother to our original heroine. While The Lost Prince didn't quite make it into the same league as it's predecessor for me, I don't see this as a negative because it wasn't until 
 The Iron Daughter 
 that I became a fan of Meghan's story. So on turning the final page, all I can say is, 'Bring on 
 The Traitor Son 
 !' 
 Ethan Chase. There is a lot of back and forth in Ethan's mind; his hate and fear warring with his love for his sister. He wants to see her, he doesn't. Should he forgive her? He can't ever forgive her. There's plenty of angst, but it's believable. He may have only been 4 years old when the fey kidnapped him, but he's had to deal with the ramifications his entire life. They took his sister, tore apart his family and ruined any shred of normalcy he could ever hope for. He never lets people get close; it's safer that way, for both himself and the rest of the world. The asshole persona he projects is at odds with the nice, yet troubled boy within. I can't say he quite charmed me the way Ash and Puck did, but I do like him, and he still has plenty of time to woo me over! 
 Human he may be, but Ethan's far from defenceless. He knows tricks of the trade in warding of faeries, not to mention he's a badass trained in Kali. Boy can do some serious damage with a weapon. Still, he can never quite escape the fey. So when he's thrust back into the world of his nightmares, dragging a human girl along with him, Ethan's in for one wild ride. Secrets, family drama, a missing phouka and a rising war; the time of evading the fey is long gone. Ethan's right in the middle of a dangerous game involving a creepy, haunting group of faeries who refuse to be forgotten any longer. 
 Of course, we're treated to a few familiar faces. Razor is adorable as ever and Puck is... well, PUCK! Meghan and Ash weren't as exciting for me, but I think that's because Ethan holds a lot of animosity toward those two, so I wasn't reading about how brave and smexy Ash was courtesy of Meghan's lusty thoughts. Point of View changes things! While none of newer characters have captured my heart the way the original group did, I still think they'll sparkle more in the coming books. That's not to say they're an uninteresting bunch. Kenzie is the leading lady in Ethan's life. Curious (nosy, nosy girl!), headstrong and comes pre-packaged with a spine (sometimes an upgrade we have to wait for with our YA ladies). I thought she was a good match for Ethan: patient and caring, but stubborn enough to put up with his attitude and call him on his crap. 
 And then there's a fey boy with a secret, a secret those who've read 
 The Iron Knight 
 can easily guess at, but for newcomers it will be a fun surprise. Ah, Keirran. His was an appearance I was most excited for, however he didn't quite live up to the Keirran we previously caught glimpse of. My first impression: 'Ooh, I kinda like you!' Last impression: 'Agh, idiot!' I think many will will enjoy his romantic, 'I will do anything to protect the one I love' side, but it was hard for me not to growl at his stupidity at times, particularly toward the end. Some of his heroic romantic beliefs vaguely mirror Ash putting everything on the line to be with Meghan, but I felt much more depth behind Ash's motives. Not finding Keirran's love interest all that memorable could be colouring my judgement. Regardless, I'm interested to see what impact his decisions will have on the coming books, because it does promise plenty of juicy drama and complications. 
 No Julie Kagawa novel would be complete without kickbutt action sequences, sneaky faeries, romance of the very complicated kind and a cat who thinks knows he's better than the NeverNever and human world combined. The Lost Prince checks every Kagawa prerequisite and promises an exciting, treacherous journey ahead!"

3,"Actual Rating: 2.5 stars 
 This book was in no way what I expected, but that's both a good thing and a bad thing. One thing is for sure, this novel is in no way your average contemporary romance, and judging by that cliffhanger, there's more to Hassan and Edy's story than forbidden love. However, I'll get to that little bit later. 
 As I was reading the first chapter, this book seemed right up my alley. There's the girl pining after the guy, and the guy who supposedly sees her as a little sister. It started off along the lines of my favorite romances, but it was YA instead of NA, and I was engaged. I was excited. I couldn't WAIT to see how their love would unfold. Of course, it took me a while to get used to the fact that Hassan is an Indian boy, since in today's media Indians aren't exactly known for their jock status or hotness (it's not racist since I'm Indian!). After I got on board though, I couldn't wait to see how the couple would overthrow an arranged-at-birth marriage! 
 I guess it's too bad that I never got to find out >.< I had no idea this was part of a series until I saw the ""'Love Edy' continues Fall 2014"" note right after the cliffhanger. I kind of died a little inside. The cliffhanger made no sense whatsoever, and left me wondering whether Hassan and Edy would ever get together. I mean, they obviously will, but I don't know if I have the patience to read another novel just to find out, especially since this first book was forcibly dragging me along for the ride. I would have liked this book so much better if it was a stand-alone, shorter, and the characters didn't act like such children. 
 What did interest me in the novel was the Indian culture. As a person who's going to have an arranged marriage myself one day (though it wasn't arranged at birth, thank goodness), I kept finding myself comparing my life and Hassan's. While his mother was pretty close to an Indian mom, I still think she should have been stricter, and more intent on keeping Edy and Hassan apart. And Hassan complained about wishing he had normal American parents, but his life was pretty close to a normal American's. Unlike him, I'm not allowed to go to parties, and I definitely wouldn't be allowed to just randomly kiss guys. Speaking of, I do not understand how Hassan was allowed to kiss a girl, invite a girl to his house, and/or let her sleep over IN HIS ROOM? NO Indian parent, under ANY, would allow that, especially if his son already had a future bride. Still, while the unusual portrayal of Indian culture bothered me, I doubt it'll really stop anyone from enjoying the story. 
 As I said before, the plot was pretty interesting, and Wyatt's character was kind of creepy and would have helped make an excellent story, if only this book didn't drag. There were elements added that I didn't see the necessity of, for example, Edy's summer vacation spent with her cousin in New York...I don't think we need to know about how she wanted to learn a new style of dancing. And Edy and Hassan's behavior when they were together? It was obvious they wanted each other, and their jealous tantrums were getting on my nerves. I'm not a person known for having patience, and with the novel spending more time on Edy and Hassan pretending to be friends, Hassan bullying Edy's friend, etc, I soon grew bored. 
 I spent almost two years with these characters, and I wish 'Love Edy' focused instead on a smaller period of time, quickened the plot, and made Edy just a bit less Hassan-crazy. Nevertheless, that out-of-nowhere ending caught my interest, and I would love to find out exactly what was happening. I'd recommend fans of romance and mixed-culture relationships to give this novel a try, because if there's one thing this book is, it's unique."
4,"Perfect Lies is the sequel to Mind Games and finds sisters Fia and Annie split apart. Annie is working with a group dedicated to destroying the Foundation and Fia is concentrating on bringing it down from the inside with the founder's son James on her side. Annie can see the future and Fia has perfect instincts but that may not be enough for them to succeed. 
 For the most part I enjoyed Mind Games, the first book in this series, but it didn't blow me away. I had enjoyed the characters and the concept enough to give the sequel a chance. And I'm glad I did. Perfect Lies was action-packed, full of twists, never fully knowing who to trust, complex. We get to see more characters and learn more about The Foundation and the world it's set in. 
 I liked the back and forth POVs between the sisters but it could get a little confusing since they were happening at different times, both leading up to the same event. One started months before and the other one was only days. 
 Fia's slow descent into losing herself and Annie's desperation to save her was interesting to read. It seemed the stronger and more confident Annie became, the more Fia lost herself. The growth Annie shows from Mind Games to this book was amazing and I love that we got to see her work to become better instead of it being glazed over. Fia's struggles really pulled at my heart. We see her wondering if after all she's had to do, can she ever be whole and good again? 
 I would have liked to see some of the side characters, especially ones we met in the first book, developed a little more. With the action moving so fast and the book so short, it didn't leave a whole lot of room for little details and wrapping everything up, though some things did work with a more open ending. 
 Last I checked this was a duology but if it turned into a trilogy, or even had an after novella, I wouldn't complain. 
 * I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."
4,"Favourite Quote: ""I might not be ready to pour out my feelings to the world, but I'd had enough of trying to ignore them."" 
 Wow! Ultraviolet is an incredibly original and hypnotic read. I just loved how refreshingly different it was from the plot to the characters to even the style of writing. Everything was unique and it that made for such a standout read. 
 Ultraviolet is the story of Alison who is placed in a psychiatric unit after complete breakdown. She is also the main suspect in the murder case of the most popular girl at school Tori. But nobody knows what happened including Alison as there is no body. All Alison can remember is one moment she was arguing with Tori then next thing she had disintegrated into thin air. Is Alison going crazy? Or there an extraordinary answer for it all? 
 The plot pulls you in from the first page and you are completely hooked until the end. It is filled with some very delicious unexpected twists. I really thought I knew what was going on but I had no idea. I love that Ultraviolet was not what I expected because it ended up being so much more. 
 R.J. Anderson writing is alluring and vividly descriptive especially when it came to describing Alison condition of synesthesia - tasting words, how each letter has a personality and a colour and in general just seeing so much more than the rest of us. It was definitely interesting element to the story and made Alison an extraordinary character. 
 ""Seconds shaded into minutes, and the butterflies in my stomach had turned into biting horseflies, when a candy-pink squeal of delight rippled down the corridor towards me."" 
 Alison had an utterly convincing voice. She had to deal with some hard situations - locked in a mental facility, possibly killing someone, thinking she might be going crazy but her reactions were always believable. Now Faraday in a unforgettable character. Smart, kind and surprising. I only wish we had gotten more of him because I really enjoyed his presence in the story. 
 ""Dark chocolate, poured over velvet: that was how his voice tasted. I wanted him to follow me around and narrate the rest of my life."" 
 As for the romance it definitely didn't feel like the typical young adult romantic situation. It was that something special and yet it didn't take the focus away from the amazing plot. 
 Overall, Ultraviolet is a stunning out of the ordinary read. I definitely recommend it to people looking for something different but yet still an exceptional story. Now I just need to get my hands on more of R.J. Anderson's books."

4,"I do vaguely remember the end from the televised version, so it isn't fair to say that I'd guessed it. 
 There are a few parts where Miss Marple alludes to clues that you don't feel have been told to you, but they have been, only not when Miss Marple figures them out. 
 I don't think this is one of my favourites, but I really did enjoy it."

 I almost never DNF this far into a book, but, hey, I don't like to be predictable. 
 Despite the fact that The Serpent King's description didn't really sound like my sort of book from the pentecostal, snake-handling preacher to the name Dill, the advance praise from trusted sources convinced me to give it a go. I have some regrets at this point, obviously. 
 I'm of mixed feelings about most of it. Some things I think The Serpent King does very well; the book was very much working for me, even though it's not a topic I ever could have thought I'd enjoy reading about. The parental relationships are the strongest ones in the book for me, and I really liked how those were handled. Zentner did a great job hitting that dichotomy of knowing your parents suck but being unable to escape the desire for their approval. And, I think it's easy for me with my privileged upbringing to say ""fuck them"" and ""report them,"" but the book made me consider it from a different point of view, which I appreciate. 
 The characters never really became real for me, but they're interesting enough. Lydia especially felt kind of flat and unrealistically a nerd's dream with her incredibly successful fashion blog and blithe comebacks to bullies. Still, I wanted to keep reading. 
 But then I a plot thing happened and I'm really enraged about the plot thing, and there's no coming back and being pleased about where this is going (and I did flip to the end to confirm where it was going). 
 (view spoiler)[Travis, one of the three POV characters, dies, shot in a completely random mugging. Like, literally, he was selling firewood from his truck by the side of a country road and some assholes try to rob him and shoot him by accident out of nervousness and he DIES. 
 I'm not mad because I'm upset to lose Travis; I don't care much about Travis one way or the other. However, I DO care that a character has just been killed off to spur the development of another character. Travis got fridged. I mean, I guess I'm glad it didn't happen to Lydia, but basically Travis got whacked so that Dill might consider leaving the safe cocoon of his hometown. I just. There are ways to handle character arcs that are not this. 
 I get that random violence and accidents happen in real life, and that those can serve as catalysts for friends left behind. In fiction, though, it feels cheap and lazy imo, a way to jump your character from A to F, without bothering with B, C, D, and E. It's also a way to get people crying, which doesn't work if I don't care. (hide spoiler)] 
 I considered pushing through and finishing The Serpent King, but it would just be an exercise in frustration and I could be reading other stuff."
5,This is an amazing novel. It is certainly one of the best to come out for young adults in recent memory. I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend it for both kids and adults.
4,"It was good to have a side story with Spade, and the story read okay, however it was a little over the top and has cause spade to have a stick up his ass when it come to Denise now. I liked how it work off the sparks the reader probably noticed in previous books. It was nice to hear Spade's back story and liked how interesting he was before he became so obsessively in love. (Bones and Cat aren't nearly as bad, and Cat always has her spunk) I look forward to a book more about Denise and her new powers though."
3,"This book read like a longish personal essay or a novelette. It felt like a sketch, an impressionistic painting, an interesting, interested glance at a very tough subject--the bloodshed in Africa and our desire to keep from seeing it, feeling it, acknowledging it. I thought Cleave brave to try and understand how Little Bee would think, speak, act. I loved his characterization of the wife, so strong, so capable. And I felt the husband rang true, too, even as he admitted his weaknesses."
4,"I wasn't sure about this book when I first started reading it. There were so many pop culture references and I'm not a huge fan of that, but as the book when along they became part of the story and didn't bother me anymore. I really enjoyed the setting and the idea of the background of the story, but I'm not sure I really liked drama. It was fine in the first story, Boys Next Door, but when it was basically repeated in the second story I was kind of annoyed. I felt like they should have had some other plotline besides pretending to date other people, like that's the only way they know how to solve their problems. Overall though, it was a cute story and I enjoyed it, though it was really long considering everyone knew what would happen at the end."
3,"""Watching her made my heart ache, as if that organ had become linked to her emotional state, rather than targeting its primary task--keeping me alive."" 
 So I did like getting to see what made Landon become Lucas, and I am a huge fan of multiple POVs. Like whenever I stumble upon it unwittingly, I grin like a fool. 
 I also really did enjoy things from Lucas' perspective, knowing what his past was like and what he was thinking was great. He was actually so much more vulnerable than I realised. And the extent of his grief, his guilt, is painful to behold. His is a great story that had to be told, how a tragedy put him on a spiralling path that he could not get off of alone. 
 He just needed one single person to extend a hand and help him step off of it. And that made all the difference. So inspiring! 
 But it felt a little stilted, the writing didn't flow as smoothly as in Easy and I knew what was coming. I still enjoyed it, I still love these two. But I really just wish it was one massive book with multiple POVs, not having left out anything of Lucas' journey."
4,Light enjoyable reading.
4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 I loved this book as much as the first. It is just so enjoyable reading a story with magic woven in so very realistically. You never doubted , You think it could happen to you. I love these ladies, and it was especially fun seen Bay in her teens. It was also nice scene Sydney being so happy living the life she was meant to live. Claire seemed much more comfortable in her skin in this book as well. I sure hope there is a third book in the series!"
3,"Very average. I enjoyed the character interactions, but unfortunately as a whole it was just...average. Full RTC."
5,"ok...add another chilling and quiet and amazing novel to my list. 
 in the middle of an isolated Iceland farm, the true story of Agnes' crime is told...along with her last year of life before her execution. 
 agnes is one of the most riveting and upsetting characters i've read in a long time. her voice (in intermittent chapters) is so true and sad and doomed. as she shifts from prisoner, to farmhand, to a member of the family -- i grew to love Agnes so much as a person. as i read, i knew where she was headed -- but of course i was hoping the entire time her fate would change. 
 really well written book, smart in how it portrays relationships and the changes in perceptions and opinions (both in agnes' past and in her present)...brilliant in it's quiet stark sentences. i loved it. 
 ps...the fact that this is a true story makes it even more chilling and sad."
1,"I was troubled by the content of this book. Two teenagers commit a series of wildly selfish, dishonest acts, then a man dies because of it. (This is not a spoiler- the information is right on the first page.) 
 What troubles me is that the characters have no apparent consciences. They spend the book blaming their parents, their creepy friend, or Cruel Fate. There is a tacked-on epilogue which says we are responsible for our own actions, but it does not express a sense of regret over the actions that occurred up to that point. 
 This book probably gets some of its praise for ""telling it like it is"" and portraying the ""reality"" of teenage life today. All I can say to that this book does not represent the reality of my teenage years, nor the teenage years of any of my friends."
3,I liked this. Parts of it even made me a little emotional. I just wish the ending hadn't felt so rushed.
5,Just as wonderful as the first. I love this world Goodman has created. The forbidden love between the main characters is so achingly poignant. Oh my goodness...the feels in this one. This is becoming one of my favorite series. I can't wait to read the next one!
5,"For Christmas I received The Passage and The Twelve. What a wonderful gift. I'd been reluctant to read The Passage, don't know why, maybe just crazy stubborness. Once I started, I couldn't put it down. I grabbed The Twelve and delved into it like a drowing man for a raft. I had to know what happened, just had to. 
 The Twelve takes the story further, adds to it with other characters, and backtracks between different timelines. I could get picky here and nitpick, but I won't, because Cronin always has a purpose with his introduction of this and that. While reading you can trust that this part, though it doesn't feel relevant now, will be later, and you have to have faith in him as a writer. 
 I can't tell you how many times while reading his books, I had that Ahh Haa moment. ""Oh, I see now. Oh, how cool."" 
 He is brilliant and he truly has a gift as a writer. 
 Read and Enjoy!"
4,"I'm going to have to punt here; I read 4 David Sederis books back to back while home ill with a fever. It was all perfect reading material for that, amusing and well-written, but there's no way I'm going to be able to keep straight what was in what book, so they're all getting 4 stars and this review."
4,"As someone in the PR industry, this book is an extremely interesting insight into why people behave the way they do."
4,"An intense, fast read. It's been a while since I've read a horror/thriller book and this was a great one to get into. It's very well written story with a lot of good twists and ""whoa"" moments...especially the big reveal at the finale. There are some plot holes and minor storytelling issues, but I found them easily overlooked as the story grabbed me and I really didn't have time to think about them until finishing and reflecting what happened. Definitely recommended. 
 Some cursing involved (about 10 or so F-words). No sexual content. Some bloody moments, but nothing too gratuitous."
3,"I don't read very much sci fi - confession, I find a lot of it quite boring - but a coworker recommended me this book so I gave it a go. Enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would. It's so much more than just a space-alien-battle novel."
4,"This review originally posted at More Than Just Magic 
 Prodigy starts out on a completely different note than Legend. Day and June are now working together and running for their lives. The tension and action is already cranked up and you're on edge wondering what will happen next. 
 I love Day and June. I loved how their personalities grow as they experience things together but I also like that their differences were kept intact. Things just wouldn't be right if they weren't such different people, with different ideas and beliefs. But it is their differences that make them stronger. (Do you think I said different enough?) They help each other see things from different perspectives and that helps them become better people all around. I also really liked that they don't give up on one another when the going gets tough. They're willing to give each other the benefit of the doubt even when things look suspicious. I think in a ""normal"" world they would be the ultimate power couple. 
 Prodigy also gets an A+++ for world building. Not only does the world feel like it's springing to life in front of you, Marie Lu takes time to explain how the world got the way it did and how it operates now. I hate when dystopian novels simply have ""Random Horrible Government X"" with almost no explanation for how the world got that way and why people sat passively by and let it happen. Marie Lu gives the reader excellent perspective and history and I thought the entire situation was believable and logical. I also loved that we got a look at the Capitol, the Patriots and the Republic and were able to see the positives and negatives of each. No government system is perfect and Prodigy is upfront about it. 
 I thought all the characters in Prodigy, new and old, were pretty well developed and intriguing. The only one I really had a problem with was Tess. I really liked her in Legend but in Prodigy she just fell a little flat for my taste. I couldn't quite buy her storyline and I kept wanting to reach into the book and shake some sense into her. Hopefully she goes back to her regular self in book 3! 
 Overall I found that Prodigy was different from Legend but in a good way. It didn't have that same high action feel (although it was high drama) but in exchange the series has become a lot more detailed and thoughtful. 
 Recommendation: An absolute must for fans of Legend. This is one sequel that will not disappoint."
3,Maybe I was expecting more Shadow of the wind that I ended up anticipating and anticipating and anticipating until the book came to an end.
4,"Finally Mia is growing up! 
 Once again Lilly is my least favorite character. These books looks like They are finally taking a turn."
5,"I can't believe I've gone so far through life without reading this. A very good read indeed. With glaring truths and comparisons to modern day politics and propoganda becoming more and more evident as you progress through the book, and with a subtlety throughout, this was very readable. If you haven't read this, perhaps you should."
5,"I read this childrens/young adult science fiction book for the first time as an adult, and I think it can be enjoyed by everyone 9 and up. 
 It's a very thought provoking, character driven science fiction book. I think it's a perfect book for discussion because it touches on so many deep issues. It reminds me a little of Madeleine L'Engle's masterpiece A Wrinkle in Time in its exploration of the worth of depth of feelings vs. numbness, individuality vs. sameness, community vs. isolation, control vs. freedom. 
 I cared about the Jonas and his life, and was emotionally invested in some of the other characters too . The alternate future society shown is fascinating and disturbing, and a little too believable for comfort. 
 Some readers complain about the open ended ending in this book but I like how the author leaves some things up to the readers' imaginations. I have an ending in my mind and other readers will have different interpretations. 
 On a reread a decade and a half after my first reading, I found I wanted more detail in the middle, not the end, of the book. However, I think perhaps it's written just right for the middle school audience; it doesn't go into as much depth as some adult novels but it's not inferior in the slightest in my opinion. It's a wonderful introductory dystopian fiction novel. 
 On my reread I did notice one thing that I'd love to ask Lois Lowry about: Jonas seems to know one word that perhaps he would not know and I'm curious about that."
3,"This omnibus edition of the third and fourth books in Sniegoski's series about fallen angels is just as entertaining as the first. In Aerie, we follow Aaron as he continues to search for his little brother, who has been kidnapped by the Powers, and in Reckoning we witness the lead up to the final battle between Aaron, the child of prophesy, and the misguided and increasingly delusional leader of the Powers host, Verchiel. 
 Aerie 
 The book is largely focussed on the safe haven of Aerie that the Nephilim and fallen angels have set up for themselves, and how Aaron's arrival, as the Nephilim of the prophesy, affects them. I really liked the atmosphere the community had and the new characters of Lorelei and Lehash, and of course the father-figure Belphegor. The brief sojourn allowed Aaron to come to terms with everything that happened in the two books prior and to discover more about his powers and heritage. 
 The joining of Aaron's human and angelic natures is great to read about, and his training is pretty well realised. I liked that he was just as committed to finding his brother and avenging his parents as in the previous books. Although, it's easy to sympathise with the residents of Aerie and understand why they don't believe that Aaron is the saviour of the prophesy, I was really disappointed in them, and how Aaron handled the criticism (not well). But they came around in the end! 
 The leader of the Powers host, Verchiel, is just as determined and demented in this book, and I found it harder and harder to like him because of how he thinks and what he feels is justifiable in his out-dated war. The final showdown between the monster that Verchiel created and Aaron was heartbreaking and difficult to read, but I think the author did it well. I was affected by the great losses that the Nephilim side endured, and many of my favourite characters didn't make it, which was disappointing. 
 Reckoning 
 The inevitable showdown between Verchiel and Aaron is approaching, and Aaron is determined to avenge his family and all the others that have died just for crossing paths with the delusional angel. He is also motivated by the need to keep Vilma safe, especially since she discovered her Nephilim heritage. 
 The relationship between Vilma and Aaron is sweet but complicated by her burgeoning powers which threaten to overwhelm her. They obviously care deeply for one another, but it does seem odd that they have such violent affection for each other. I couldn't help thinking that they've only had a handful of weeks together, and the rest of the time they were separated and pining for each other. 
 My one real disappointment is that I felt that Aaron fell back on his angelic powers too much - having successfully integrated the two halves of his being, I think Aaron is too quick to use his alter ego to get his way and bully those around him. There were a few times in the book that I thought he should have talked to people instead of intimidating them. 
 Aerie and Reckoning, contained in this omnibus, tell the final parts of Aaron's journey as the saviour of the fallen angels, both entertaining and heart-warming stories. There is more to come in Aaron's life, with some fallen angels deemed unready for the final forgiveness, and more Nephil children to discover and guide through their lives. This series that puts a nice twist on the usual romance-centric angel-themed fiction, and I think fans of the YA genre will enjoy Aaron's story.

5,"This was such a terrific book - it was sweet, funny, and super sexy! I loved the individual quirky behaviors that both Dash and Vivian had which really made them both very realistic and relatable characters. Dash was completely adorable, and I loved that how he worked so hard to overcome his challenges. Vivian was so strong, and I was glad that although she was so smitten with Dash still stood for what she believed in. 
 I have to admit that I am a big fan of both baseball and writings by C.D. Reiss. I loved reading more of the baseball players point of view, and I did not realize there was so much superstition by players. I guess I always assumed it was just me being a crazy fan! Who knew?? Par to the course, Reiss did not disappoint in any way - great writing, loved it, & highly recommend!"
4,"Good chemistry. 
 Witty & lovable characters. 
 Realistic ending."
2,"Though the idea of the story was gripping enough, I found the characters flat and unlikable. When terrible things happened to them--and there were many--I felt like I was supposed to pity, empathize with, or make excuses for them, without feeling like doing so. The plot had enough twists to make me curious to read the end, for the puzzle of it, however."

 With subtle differences from the Grimm tale, this story is cleverly retold by Gaiman. The tale is hauntingly delivered with the ideas of cannibalism and child abandonment at the forefront, however this version is beautifully presented. Mattotti's black and white illustrations are incredibly vivid despite only using the two colours. 
 This book may be brief at only 56 pages and half of those pages being pictures. However it is long enough to deliver a great story. Hansel and Gretel is presented in a dark and hauntingly beautiful kind of way . The drawings, the floral embellishments to the pages with text and the gorgeous green on the dust jacket - this book is absolutely lovely to read. 
 What I loved most about this book was the afterword which gave some background on Hansel and Gretel. It compares Gaiman's to the original Grimm tale and mentions international stories with similar themes throughout history. I did not know the illustrations by Mattotti were in fact the inspiration for Gaiman's take on the story! 
 Gaiman's Hansel and Gretel is a great combination of classic fairytale and eerie yet memorizing illustrations. A must for fan of dark fairytale, appropriate for young and older readers alike. 
 Thanks to Bloomsbury Australia for the review copy."

 Originally read and reviewed in September, 2013 
 IF THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A GENIE BECOMES FAMILY, POINT ME NOW TO THE NEAREST GENIE STORE!!! 
 I can't believe I haven't read this before. I guess I was too wary of finishing ALL of KA's books (since I won't have anythig left to read after). 
 A friend of mine strongly recommended this. She was telling me how different it is from the other books because this time, it's the hero who has a lot of issues in life. Boy was she right! The hero has some issues the size of a bulldozer and he carries it inside like a man possessed. He was always thinking that he's moving in borrowed time. I mean, hey, it's okay to fear that someday all things would end, but his fear was all consuming and gut wrenching it wasn't even funny. I can't believe I'll be saying this about a hero, but damn he was so frustrating at times. He's lucky that he's tall, dark and handsome, narrow hipped and powerful. I guess after all he's been through, it was just natural for him to think that he doesn't deserve all good things that have been thrown his way. He's also sooooo verrryyy lucky that the heroine was willing to fix him. 
 The heroine, of course was also unique in her own way. You see, I think KA makes three different kinds of heroines, 1. hard as nails, kickass, badass women with a little sweet side 2. sweet girls, a little nerdy and too cute, bubbly and gentle type with a backbone 3. a mixture of the first two... Now if this couple had not been through what they had in this book, I'd think that the heroine here is a type 2. But yeah, after facing what she faced, I'd say she's a type 3. I love her because she's just plain perfect, I mean, how perfect can you really be when you have been created by a genie as a wish? She just completes the whole package of this book. 
 What I love about this as well, is the plot itself. It's so uniquely carved. Who would've thought that I would love another book with genies with it? I love Aladdin, but I thought it was a fluke. haha. Oh well... Anyway, this was like a friggin soap opera. The trials that they faced were brutal and still, I love it! I couldn't do anything else as soon as i started reading this. Yes, the story is THAT GOOD! 
 All in all, this was such a nice book. I hope everyone reads it. ;)"
3,"Actual rating: 2.5 stars 
 Quick thoughts: Technically the title should have been 17 Things I Thought Were True, not 16. There were a few typographical/editing errors as well. While one or two errors do regularly slip past into publication, I get distracted when there are more than that. That aside, I thought 16 Things I thought Were True is a very relevant contemporary work of fiction. Social media is here to stay and it was firmly embedded in Morgan's life. Beyond that though, this book turned out to be pretty average. 
 Fuller review to follow."
4,"In the Thursday Next series, Jasper Fforde clearly takes great delight in wordplay and puns, most often represented with literary constructs and characteristics which are personified or otherwise made to exist in the real world. Part of me thinks he would appreciate the conversation I had with the library clerk when I checked this book out, where she mentioned reading the first two books in the series and then never going back to it. One of Our Thursdays Is Missing opens with Thursday (the character) in the Bookworld bemoaning her lack of readership. And the story just gets better from there. 
 Much of this book is centered on looking at the Bookworld, where all of the fictional characters from all of literature live, through the lens of an outworlder. Fforde turns metaphor into a controlled substance, lest it lead to the downfall of all fiction, he separates genres into different islands in the Bookworld, where most of them live peacefully, save for the odd occasions where genres bump up against each other and even start wars over the infringements, and he even takes a literary character and moves her from the Bookworld to the real world, where all of her conventions and understandings (as well as the reader's) are turned upside down and made brand new. It's all wonderfully clever, but anyone who's read the previous novels in the series won't be surprised in the least. 
 The book diverges a bit from the standard Thursday Next novel, in that this time around, Thursday Next the person (i.e., the one who's been the protagonist in the last five novels) isn't the main character; Thursday Next the character (i.e., the one who plays the part in Thursday's books in the Bookworld) is. So when Thursday (the ""person"") goes missing, then Thursday (the ""character"") winds up taking her place to solve the mystery. Since she mystery takes place within the Bookworld, it makes sense that she be the one to take on the mantle of solving it, but the story takes her in and out of the Bookworld, and other people and characters constantly confuse her with the ""real"" Thursday. Make sense? 
 Fforde takes advantage of the character being a character in a story, and creates some clever metafictional references throughout the book. I think that cleverness is what Fforde's readers have come to expect, and so long as he can maintain that characteristic in his fiction, he's going to remain successful. I wasn't sure about First Among Sequels, since Fforde seemed to have wrapped up the series so perfectly with Something Rotten, but he proved that he could still take the series in unexpected directions and still maintain the theme of the series. I'm pleased to say that he managed to do the same with One of Our Thursdays Is Missing."
3,"This is more of a 3.5 star book for me than a 3 star, I think. The problem was that Larsson was so busy piling in details that occasionally the story got rather bogged down with them. However, overall, it was a fantastic novel. 
 I loved the fact that Lisbeth isn't an easy or entirely likable character. I liked the way Mikael is kind of a foil for that - he's quite likable, so you really enjoy him and are interested in him. 
 While you enjoy Lisbeth, it's in an entirely different way. It's less because you really LIKE her, and more because you're intrigued by her, and fascinated by her. 
 On second thought, actually, I think Mikael is more likable simply BECAUSE he is a foil for Lisbeth - if she were not part of the novel, I doubt I would have liked him quite as much as I did. Clever, really. He's very human, as is Lisbeth. 
 I will definitely be reading the next two books in the series."
3,"This one kept me guessing through out the book. It was hard to figure out who was a plain human and who wasn't. It seemed like each time you thought you had things down, something would happen to make you wonder again. 
 I did like that the story was told from multiple views. It was interesting to see how each person dealt with things, who they would trust, and how long it took for them to give up hope. 
 With the ending it will be interesting to see where things go from here for the group, will they be able to stay hidden or not."
4,"I can't give it a whooping 5 this time cause almost 50% of the story I was getting tired of poor Emma.... but I will give a whooping 5 to Evan! I love the story, the end of the their story or how it breaks out to, I find it a bit rush? Not so sure.... Anyway, book 1 & 2 was amazing, the conclusion, I'm still in a limbo on what I just read...."
5,"I can't even put in to words how good this book is. It made me feel everything ... Only a Kristen Ashley can do this, I can't even begin to review because no matter what I say it still wouldnt do this book justice. Read it and weep my friends and if you don't more fool you. 
 Xo"
4,"Loved this novel written through letters and records. Easy, breezy reading with a nice, fast flow reveals the unfolding of a family crisis and background experiences leading to it. This is one of those books that doesn't completely finish the ending, but you're pretty darn sure what that is - giving your imagination room for play, but not in an unsettling fashion."
5,"This book is intense and left me screaming ""NOOOOOOOOO NO NO NOOOOO"" a lot. Amazing. 
 Full review here: http://youtu.be/HE-M9ukiPLI"
3,"I have got to admit that the ending to this book and this series was absolutely jarring. In a good way. But the buildup to the ending was boring and predictable. It took me forever to finish this book because at one point I almost had given up reading it. 
 I think Dashner did a fantastic job creating the world, and the plot twist at the very very end was something I had not expected at all. He did a great job building stronger character relationships and chose the perfect people to kill off. Well, not perfect, but I think their deaths were necessary to exaggerate the themes in this story."
4,"I didn't like Antony and Cleopatra very much at the beginning -- but then, it always seems to take about an act for me to get into the swing of a Shakespeare play. It helps with Julius Caesar and Antony and Cleopatra that I'm familiar with the history it's based on. It took me a while to warm to the characters of Antony and Cleopatra, though, but for all that there's something very human about the way Cleopatra reacts to Antony -- now this, now that -- and how he responds to her. 
 There are, of course, some beautiful speeches and descriptions here: I was nudged into reading this by reading a reference just yesterday to Cleopatra burning upon the water. I don't think I've seen this one as often quoted as I have the other Shakespeare plays I've been reading lately, though..."
4,"Rating : 4.5 
 It was so adorable. I loved it and I totally recommend it to everyone"
1,The characters didn't come to life for me and the dialogue felt forced.
5,"Though this isn't the first book I've read by Joya Ryan (I loved Chasing Desire), this is the first I've read in the Serve series...so I didn't have any preset expectations. My overall thought? LOVED it! Tremendously hot and sexy with just enough personal issues thrown in to create friction and that bit of drama, Rules of Seduction totally hooked me from the start and I just couldn't put it down. 
 Ava is starting over, trying to break away from her past. She shows great strength of character, and even though this story is not very long we still get to see her character grow once she goes to Serve and meets Nolan. Her need to keep her sex life separate as a fantasy is understandable given the little we know about her past. Nolan-now he's one you want to steal away and keep for yourself. The consummate alpha male, he has an innate need to protect, and is straightforward, very open, and oh yes...when you look up the definition of ""hot and sexy"" there's bound to be a picture of him sitting there. 
 The banter between the two of them, both inside and outside of Serve, is fantastic-made even better by how openly Nolan talks about everything. As for the chemistry between them-both inside the club with Nolan being Ava's anonymous lover (""Myth"") and outside as friends-it is off the charts, making for some very powerful scenes (especially the ones inside...holy hot and steamy!). It had me hoping (okay, almost begging) that Ava would be able to reconcile Nolan's two personas and move on from her past with him. 
 (view spoiler)[And okay, I know the two stories are not anything alike with the one exception of the male lead having a secret, anonymous persona, but toward the end when Ava starts to wonder and suspect that Nolan is Myth...it reminded me of the final scene in You've Got Mail when Meg Ryan finally finds out Tom Hanks is her mystery man, and she tells him ""I wanted it to be you""...yeah, I'm a sucker for that... (hide spoiler)] 
 Another guilty pleasure read for me from Joya Ryan...and while I would have liked to see more character development to give both Ava and Nolan some more depth, this is still a 5-star read for me, and is being added to my top recommendations list. Recommended for 18+ due to adult language and some seriously blazing sexual scenes. 
 *I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher in exchange for an honest review*"
4,A haunting and sometimes disturbing story of a father and son trying to survive as they travel through an almost deserted post apocalyptic US.
3,"One: why are there suddenly Japanese? Of all the cultures to randomly throw into your primarily Jewish/Muslim/Christian religious mix, why on earth would you decide to add Japan. 
 Two: I must say, I'm not sure any other writer gives me the impression anyone could die permanently half so well as Hurley. Which I both enjoy, because it's unusual not to be able to rely on ""the good guys will be okay"", but also hate, because half the time I get invested in someone in this series they die. 
 Three: I really hope there isn't actually more, because it gets more and more ridiculous for Nyx to manage to complete missions as is, and we also keep creeping further and further into magical omnipotence for shifters and magicians. Also I have feels about Nyx and Rhys, but I don't want to get into that right now."
2,"I struggled through this book. Most of the time my mouth was hanging open catching flies because of the bull$hit going on. Not my cup of tea. 
 Two selfish people who don't have the common sense that a mouse has get married and have 6 kids, four of which survive. The mom is delusional at best, negligent and just an idiot. The dad, where to start? Pathological liar, scammer, drunk, abuser, criminal, I can probably keep going. 
 Yes, their lives sucked, but so do a lot of peoples lives. Does that mean you should write a book about it too easy your guilt? Sure, knock yourself out. Let's rehash our childhoods and see who had it worse. She win's hands down. 
 As a child, Jeannette worshipped her erratic father. His word was gospel, that was her first mistake. Her sister Lori already figured that game out, but gullible Jeannette ate it hook line and sinker. Was her life worse than Lori, Brian, and Maureen's? No, they all lived in that crazy house, they were all told the same lies. It's just that some kids believe the hype and fairytales, while other's realize the stories for what they are - stories."
4,"WHAT DID I JUST READ!? okay first, I feel like I need a few days to process. second, are you serious?? that was the end? (view spoiler)[ Amy is a freaking crazy person, Nick isn't much better. I'm sure I wasn't the only person turning the pages in hopes of Amy getting arrested. Sure, Nick cheated, but did he deserve life in prison for it? No. what a whack-job Amy is to sit and wait to fulfill her devious, brilliant I'll be it plan. thoroughly pisses me off that no one was capable of out cunning her.(view spoiler)[ the events that happened in this book were very unexpected for me. in a great way. I went into this book based on its reviews alone, I did not read the blurb or any info about it. I think that turned out as a benefit for this particular book. Recommended to all. (hide spoiler)] (hide spoiler)]"
5,"Typically I'm upset when they go changing everything about a comic character I love. But that's the beauty of killing off the hero (In a different universe mind you) and having him replaced. Miles is a great character, with powers all his own. It was great seeing how he would handle taking the place of Spider-man and how people would react."
3,"This story is so well drawn out. Melissa de la Cruz is an interesting, fun author and I think this book is surly worth reading."
4,"This book really surprised me. I mean, REALLY surprised me. It's cover reads very ""Twilight Wannabe"" and the description isn't much better (not to mention the girl on the front looks like Angelina Jolie.) All that combined, I've been writing this book for for years. It doesn't help that it appeared right the vampire surge. 
 However Mead creates characters that you care about. I think I liked Dimitri the best, despite him not being a main character (more like the main character's love interest.) I liked that Lissa wasn't always the demure one who needed to be protected. Sometimes, she could be dangerous, more so than Rose if that's what it comes down to. 
 Rose, despite being our protagonist, was the one that I liked the least. It's not that I didn't like her, she just wasn't a very dynamic character. She was a teenage girl who lusted after boys but still made Lissa, and Lissa's protection, her number one prioriety. While in some ways she did mature in the book, sometimes she just kind of drove me crazy. 
 Mead also writes very well. It was engaging and interesting and the story moved at a good pace. Lately, I've been reading some books with terrible dialogue and that wasn't an issue with Mead. 
 The only downfall of this book is that it's very obviously a YA lit book. The characters are incredibly interested in their social standing, the rumors in this place fly at an ungodly pace (almost to the point that it's unrealistic how fast the rumors spread) and, while the school is a little more dangerous than say public school (after all, it's full of Vampires and half-vampires), it still is a high school at the end of the day. They seem to care more about social standing and people's royalty ties than say, I don't know, the dead animals that keep showing up in Lissa's room. 
 Also, the book was INCREDIBLY predictable. I knew from almost moment one who the bad guy was, but, that's actually not such a big deal. The bad guy isn't really the POINT of this book."
4,"I enjoyed this more than I thought I would, though was sad it ended so bitterly."
4,"""Let us violate cakes together"" 
 Short but very funny. It had me laughing out loud quite a few times. I wish there would have been a bit more to it but it was still very enjoyable."
3,"This review is also available on my blog. 
 Like the title, I was expecting something, y'know, amazing. And I refused to be put down by it's average Goodreads rating - I was determined to like The Promise of Amazing. Its premise was interesting, because who doesn't like the trying-to-change good girl and the trying-to-change bad boy? And then they meet each other and learn to change and ride off into the sunset on the unicorn. 
 Well, not in this one. 
 I had two chief problems with this book. The first was Grayson. Look, I like bad boys, I really do. But Grayson was just... irritating. I simply couldn't bring myself to like him, and though I didn't actively dislike him either, the passive feeling I had for him made his POV just... drab. I was prepared to forgive him choking on a cocktail weenie, but not much else. 
 Then the insta-love. It's so overwhelmingly illogical! I guess you could explain away Grayson's side of it, because Wren saved his life and all, but he's still so stupid about her. And she's so stupid about him. They're both stupid. No wonder Wren didn't get into her school's honor society. 
 Oops. 
 The 'magnetic pull' between them was so cringe-worthy, and I honestly didn't care if they got together. If I don't even care about the romance in a romance novel, then what do I care about?! The entire angle was so boring. 
 Wren easily forgives Grayson all his stupid, lying-cheating-scum past despite the fact that she was the victim of some of that lying. Why? Because he's oh-so-good-looking, who can deny him? No. Just no. As a reader, I'm not buying that. As a person, I'm not buying that! There's more angst-hesitation in This Is What Happy Looks Like, and that is because Graham is a movie star, not a player. Speaking of TIWHLL, I was constantly comparing The Promise of Amazing to it and other Jennifer E. Smith books, because that was what I was expecting from it. I was expecting something cute, and some level of character development beyond the romance. Wren especially was completely swept under the rug by the romance. Her story, her struggle with being 'quiet', the fact that she doesn't know what to do with her life, could have been expanded on so well but that entire plot-line just disappears with the introduction of the romance. What?? It looks like Wren gives up 80% of her life when Grayson shows up, and that's something I'm entirely not comfortable with. 
 And Wren being quiet. She's always irritated when people mention it, but the fact of the matter is that she is quiet. She doesn't even do anything concrete to change that even though that's what she wanted! Okay, so her parents' property suffered some hundreds of dollars in damage because of her. Is that what loud is?! Maybe I should check if all my parents' things are insured, because I'm loud, so does that mean I might be breaking windows sometime soon? It's like all YA knows is the two extremes of good girl and rebel. Where does that leave people like me, who aren't quiet and shy but aren't outgoing and party-rocker either? This is so irritating and it happens all the time in contemp YA. 
 Well, it certainly seems like I had more than just two problems with it."
5,One of Kristen Ashley's best books ever. You will love Faye and Chace. Another phenomenal story and yet another fabulous alpha male! Have Kleenex ready near the end. Thanks Kristen!
5,Best new UF series I've read in a very long time!!!! Full review soon!!!
5,"This book surely contributed a little to making me a chubby child! That page with all the delicious food still makes me hungry just thinking about it. It is probably my all-time favourite children's picture book, and one I always buy for a little one's birthday."
4,"Book #5 of Booktubeathon 2016 
 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FEEL ABOUT THIS 
 On one hand, I feel happy the story is evolving and abou to reach a climax, but, on the other hand, it seems as if more and more mysteries keep dragging along and we NEVER get any answers at all. I am excited enough to read the ~last volume~."
4,"4/5 Stars 
 I really enjoyed reading Rise of Empire, I definitely enjoyed it more then Theft of Swords. This book certainly picked up the pace from book one, seriously interesting things actually happened in this book. The plot was fast paced and stimulating. I believe there was a fair bit of badassery going on. I didn't even notice the weird emotionless POV much this time, like yeah it was obviously still there, 
 but it's more bearable because I've finally warmed up to the characters. 
 This still isn't my favourite 'bromance' ever, I really like Royce and Hadrian and enjoy their banter. But for me the bromance just isn't there yet, like I feel I'm missing something. ARE WE READING THE SAME BOOK?!? 
 Once again this book is two novels in one. This time around we get Nyphron Rising and The Emerald Storm. All stories are a continuation of each other with a connected plot, so it flows really well. 
 Michael J Sullivan is a fantastic writer, his books are easy to read, his a great vivid world-builder and its definitely a humorous and fun read. 
 I found the pacing better in this instalment then Theft of Swords, the overall storyline was once again unoriginal but good. In my opinion this book was a little more my cup tea. Theft of Swords was very ""classic"" fantasy, it didn't have much violence. Whereas this book Rise of Empire was a little more dark, we got to read about the darker side to Royce, Hadrian and Arista. I really enjoyed the overall vibe in this book, we witnessed a few brutal barbaric acts like floggings and the fight scenes which might I add were next level to what I saw in book one, they were fantastic, a certain fight scene was so amazing, I was on the edge of seat while reading it, while having heart palpitations, so yeah that was pretty fun. This book was also more complex then the first, it had a few major twists, aswell as castle intrigue, court politics, love and relationship secrets, *sounds of amazement* finally getting some good stuff out of Michael J Sullivan's novels. Its definitely safe to say I'm a fan of The Riyria and want more! I can't wait to finish the series. 
 Seriously I love Arista so much. I just low key wish I was her so I could turn people into frogs. 
 I didn't like Nyphron Rising as much as The Emerald Storm, only because it wasn't as action packed, other then that it was a really good book. I liked it a lot. I love Arista so was happy to have a story with her POV, as one of the main POV's. This story is set a year after the last book, and is basically about the beginning of a war. Hadrian and Royce are now both retired but go on their 'last mission' (they're always saying, every mission is their last lol). Arista sets off on a mission to save her brothers empire and takes Hadrian and Royce with her. The story was thrilling and engaging enough, I just wanted more action?! Luckily The Emerald Storm delivered me a lot of violence so I'm now a happy camper. 
 My favorite out of the two stories was definitely The Emerald Storm, it was so EPIC. This book is what I was waiting for, seriously thank you Michael J Sullivan for finally showing me your potential as an author, this book definitely exceeded my expectations and I loved it! Seriously, it was so bloody good. It was your typical action packed Pirate story, we follow Royce and Hadrian as they go on a journey to find an object. Of course the journey doesn't go to plan and they find themselves in a deadly location. The rumours are definitely true folks, this series gets better with each book. The twists and reveals at the end were mind blowing and IT ACTUALLY HAD AWESOME FIGHT SCENES. This was an action packed, fun, exhilarating book that I absolutely loved reading and I just need to fangirl over Hadrian, Royce & Arista. Seriously they are all awesome. I really missed Myron this story but found Hadrian's POV to be my relief this time around. I really love Hadrian now, he is so amazing, clumsy, funny, dopey and he is very badass and handsome. Definitely swoon worthy, when he withdrew his Spadone sword shit got hectic and a lot of people died(yayayayaya). But I can't chose if I like him more then Royce or not. Royce definitely had a few standout badass moments in these books and I have a new level of respect for him. 
 ""Oh, sir, you have no idea what Royce is like. I'll grant you that his association with Hadrian Blackwater has tempered him greatly. Twelve years with that idealistic dreamer have made him practically human, but I know him. I know what lurks beneath. I've seen things that make even my hardened heart shudder. Get his anger up, and you'll unleash a demon that no one can control. Believe me, he's like that and so much more. Nothing is beyond him"" 
 I recommend this book to all fantasy lovers. Although I must say if you are looking for a blood bath or a high violence fantasy, then keep on looking this is a more humorous soft fantasy, with classic themes. Definitely a fun filled read that I'm sure most fantasy fans would love.

3,"Maybe someday I'll start finding her books less cheesy. 
 3.5 stars because of that fabulous soundtrack though."
2,"Far too short. Short stories and mysteries don't really blend well. Things always seem like they're figured out too easily, and it didn't seem like there needed to be so many ""suspects"" in this one."
3,"Satirically smart, plot sporadically stupid, but a whole lotta fun to read. It's a surprisingly good YA selection for young women to teach them about self-esteem and feminism."
3,"Better than his other set of Old Kingdom novella + short stories collection, which is strange because this was published longer ago. Maybe it's just that I don't like short stories that much, and the short stories in here were longer. It's okay, did not inspire much emotion in me one way or the other, but rounded up to 3 stars because it didn't make me angry. I probably did not need to read this before Goldenhand."

 Part 1 of the Series Review 
 First Thought when Finished: Shatter Me by Tahereh Mafi was different, interesting, and engaging! Bring me the next one please! 
 Part 1 Thoughts: 
 I picked up Shatter Me for 2 reasons: 
 1: Most of my friends (even the non-YA readers like myself) enjoyed it 
 2: It was on sale at Audible 
 I have to say that overall I found the world different, interesting, and engaging. The story was slow to start but once it got moving, I was invested. The world building was fantastic! I could picture the world in my mind's eye and while I have no desire to travel there, had no problem picturing the characters maneuvering around. The characters are what drew me to the story though. I thought Juliette was equal parts fascinating and damaged. Her life experiences made her both wise and foolish. I was intrigued by Warner and what made him tick. Was he just this bad ass nut case that was truly evil or is there more there? Adam was a little one dimensional to me but he did fulfill an important role: he gave Juliette someone to count on. That role is significant because she could begin to bloom. The pacing and action were a little uneven in the beginning but once the story hit it's stride the speed, urgency, and desperation of the characters was on par with the action. For a first book in a trilogy, it was fantastic! 
 Audio Thoughts: 
 Narrated By Kate Simses / Length: 9 hrs and 12 mins 
 This is the first book I have listened too narrated by Kate. I thought she did a great job with Juliette, Adam, and Warner. I was a little surprised there weren't two narrators for this book (as the guys got as much page time as Juliette) but Kate (for the most part) pulled it off pretty well. 
 Final Thoughts: Interesting and engaging I will be continuing this series."
3,"What can I say about Veterans? It's been several days since I've finished the Special Forces series, and the emotional turmoil has finally settled into a rhythmic roil. We have seen the beginnings of Vadim and Dan in Soldiers, and witnessed their change throughout Mercenaries. At this point, we are under no delusions that both our MCs have irreversibly changed from the first book, and are not the same men. 
 However, Dan and Vadim aren't through yet. While war can devastate even the best of men, peace can cut as deep as any knife on the battlefield. Both characters are trying to navigate their lives in the absence of that volatile world. 
 To be honest, I felt Veterans was longer than it really needed to be. There were many scenes that I felt didn't need to be addressed at all, or could have been summarized. It was distracting enough to introduce so many secondary characters throughout Mercenaries, but we get even more new characters added to the batch. After a while, it really distracted from Vadim and Dan, which was all I really cared for. Not only that, but I felt like every male character that our MCs meet are closeted gay men whose problems were solved by sharing sex. That, and the fact that Dan was playing cupid for all these lost gay souls (which was even joked about in the book by Vadim). 
 The good? Well...when the story didn't seem to drag into the lives of secondary characters or playing matchmaker with such characters, the story really SHINED. These were the conflicts between Dan and Vadim, such as (view spoiler)[ the replacement knee surgery and Dan's depression, the three month long therapy for Vadim, Kisa's reunion, etc. (hide spoiler)]. During these moments, I cried because the journey for these men was never easy. These are men that deserve love, but could never seem to obtain or acknowledge it. And when all is said and done? Even though these guys have changed from the men in Soldiers (whom I loved), I still hold them dear in my heart and wish them nothing less of a HEA. 
 Despite how I felt about every book following Soldiers, I am glad that I continued on. Would I say SF was one of my favorite series? No. But in terms of relationships, Dan and Vadim would definitely be one of my favorite couples of all time."
5,"I think if I had played the lotto while reading this book I'd be rich by now. I knew there was something wrong with that son of a harlot! I can't even. You can all hate on the King, I'll start my very own time-to-kill-Anushka squad because that piece of crap Cecile calls mom is a psychotic, unforgiving, cold-hearted murderer! Doom an entire race because of the mistake of one? Gone too far! 
 And don't get me started on Roland screwed-up mind or on the equally disturbing mofo Lessa! What is wrong with people in this book? 
 And that plot twist! I couldn't contain my excitement when they were finally reunited, even if Cecile didn't have the best timing in the world, it was about time they were reunited. 
 Tristan's father is so goddamn interesting, he's so complex and it's hard to guess what his goals are and what will be his next step. Btw where the fuck is Chris? He better be safe and sound or I'll go berserk. 
 And holy shit! What's this whole Winter Court and Summer Court stuff? What favor does Tristan owes to the Winter Queen? Ugh this long year of waiting will drive me crazy!"
3,"I liked how we got to know the gunslinger, how we got to know the basics in the story and not much at all about how it is going to proceed."
4,"I liked this book almost as much as Garden Spells. I loved that books follow one of the characters around. I wish books followed me. That would be so awesome. I liked how all of the characters really grew as the story progressed. I also like how the author wove in the back stories to a lot of the characters without making it feel tedious. 
 The more I read from this author, the more impressed I am with her."

4,"So, this is something new for me to read. This is my first time to read a suspense-romance kind of thing (since i'm into romcom). Anyhoo, I enjoyed it. Although, I wish some parts were given more emphasis (like that part where Jack discovered about the microphone thing and then Lombard came in). As for Cameron, unfortunately, I think she lacks a bit of lawyer-y type of character in her (compared to Payton and Taylor from previous Julie James Book). But overall, Cameron and Jack had chemistry and that is something to commend for. Looking forward to read the next book, A Lot Like Love"
0,"DNF, chapter 4. 
 I was sucked in by the beautiful cover. 
 Unfortunately, the mermaids here are nothing more than some catty modern teenagers with some words substituted and some generic 'fairytale' elements thrown in. 
 ""Merboys"" have ""merlfriends"" (yes, really) and might ""swim with a fast crowd."" 
 They wear gowns, have ""updos"" and dye their hair (yes, all underwater.) And above all, apparently, love gossiping. The mer-court seems like a cliquish high school. 
 The main character is a mer-princess about to be betrothed and rule the realm, but she doesn't come off as someone raised to wield power at all - instead she's busy whining at her mother ""Why can't you be a mom instead of a queen"" (paraphrase). 
 At Chapter 4, I'd had enough of it. (And I thought I could perceive a romance on the near-horizon, too.) 
 One disappointed mermaid fan, here."
4,"This was a really great story with a lot of representation. It was short but very impactful, and Kody Keplinger's writing and characters shined. Both Bo and Agnes go through some really heavy stuff, and I felt like Keplinger did a great job of writing about Bo and Agnes' experiences. The side characters were also interesting, and I loved how Keplinger wove them throughout the novel and allowed them to grow alongside Bo and Agnes."
5,"Delaney Collins knows that happily ever after is a joke. Things don't end happily and she certainly isn't living in a fairy tale. Not when her mom is dead and she is being forcibly moved across the country to live with her life coach father ""Dr. Hank"" in California. 
 Some happy ending. 
 Life in California is not what Delaney expected. Everything is bright and shiny. Keeping a low profile at school is impossible when everyone from head cheerleader Cadie to yearbook geek Flynn wants to be her friend. (Until she disabuses them of such notions at least.) And Dr. Hank is keeping a secret about what he really does to help his ""clients"" in need of life coaching. 
 A really big secret. 
 Turns out Dr. Hank is really a fairy godmother--granter of wishes, inhabitant of fairy tales everywhere. And the fairy godmother condition is hereditary. Meaning Delaney Collins, the girl with the fierce attitude and boots to match is a fairy godmother with wishes of her own to grant. If she can ever get the hang of her powers, that is. 
 As Delaney struggles to help her first client she realizes that sometimes even a fairy godmother needs a wish of her own in Don't Expect Magic (2011) by Kathy McCullough. 
 Don't Expect Magic is McCullough's first novel. 
 This story is really sweet hold the saccharin. Delaney is a no nonsense narrator with great taste in footwear even if it does take her a while to develop her taste for good friends. McCullough's writing is spot-on capturing Delaney's initial surly mood as well as her transformation throughout the story. 
 Though I would have loved more background about fairy godmother-ness, Don't Expect Magic remains a clever reinterpretation of one of the most ubiquitous fairy tale characters of all time. In addition to having a fun setting and premise, this book shines as a story about adapting and moving on--even when it's the last thing you want to do. 
 Part modern fairy tale, part journey Don't Expect Magic is a delightful book for anyone waiting for their happy ending. (And even anyone who already has their happy ending too.) 
 Possible Pairings: Waiting For You by Susane Colasanti, Donorboy by Brendan Halpin, Friends With Boys by Faith Erin Hicks, Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine, Lola and the Boy Next Door by Stephanie Perkins, Vibes by Amy Kathleen Ryan"
4,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. but... then... how....that ending? what. the actual. fuck.
3,Good strong writing and hilarious to boot. But a disappointing and anticlimactic ending and rather flat characters
5,excellent writer - kids book
5,I'm loving getting to know this pack and all it's members. No matter what struggles and challenges they face they always rise above. I'm hoping Vaughn and cati's story is next.
5,"""Sitting on the couches, all drinking coffee, were a bunch of men. Not just any men. It looked like GQ was having a convention and all the best looking guys had decided to have a coffee at Fortnum's before going to seminars on how to cope with being really, unbelievably, fucking gorgeous."" 
 Oh dear lord, and I thought I loved Eddie? He doesn't even come close to Hank Nightingale. What an overall brilliant character. I wasn't expecting him to end up the way he did. He is a badass alpha male cop who doesn't beat around the bush, yet has the biggest heart (The fact that he has a dog, swoon). He instantly sees straight through Roxie and wears her down. 
 Roxie was stubborn, yet fun. She could let loose and stick up for herself. Yet she was wary about letting Hank, and the rest of the gang, in due to her slime ball ex boyfriend. Their story was a fun one to read. 
 For some reason, I really enjoyed the big profound moment between Roxie and Duke. Duke hasn't been such a big character but what he said just felt right to come from him. 
 ""These boys need women who can take the heat without meltin' like butter, and sometimes that heat is fiery. They need women who can give back their shit so they don't walk all over 'em and get bored out of their fucking skulls. And they need women who can go soft when the situation demands because they get hard knows on a regular basis, sometimes literally, and comin' home to somethin' soft is the only way to cope. 
 Holy fucking cow. 
 ""You think I'm a woman like that?"" I asked him. 
 ""I think there are a fair few women like that in the whole fuckin' world. And yeah, you're one of them."" Um... wow."" 
 I loved the playful banter between all the characters. I had a smile planted on my face for a good portion of the book. 
 Definitely adding this one to my favourite's shelf. 
 I, now, can't wait to read the rest. Vance's story next, and boy oh boy, I can't wait for Luke's."
4,"So glad I finally read this. It's fortunately a classic that doesn't make you think, ""Yep, this book is OLD."" It's exciting, full of interesting characters, and really, more action/adventure than just plain literary fiction. 
 The only constant in this book is Edmond Dantes, The Count of Monte Cristo. The characters around him change like planets - in view in one chapter, totally invisible the next. Then they reappear and you're like ""Oh yeah, that guy!"" Ten years pass in the space of two sentences, people fall in love at the turn of a page, but the revenge, that's EVERYWHERE. 
 Dantes has a God complex and seeks to restore the world to what he believes is its correct working order. He's not the most likable guy ever, but he's sort of magical (another reviewer referenced Batman, which isn't far off). His crafty disguises, know-how about everything and special powers are amazing. This is as titillating as a soap opera and as overdramatic as a Shakespearian play. Men and women faint in the throes of shock (or fear or worry or joy). Embarrassed men vow to die for honor. Romantics swear their love, forsaking everything else. So much fun. 
 In reading an unabridged version, there were parts I initially found unnecessary. Early in the book there is a lot of French history. I was also frustrated that important characters were vanishing and new ones were appearing so nonchalantly. However, everything comes together in the end, and there are few characters who aren't important to the drama. 
 Worth the effort!"
3,"I received a free copy of this book from Amulet/Abrams&Chronicle in exchange for an honest review. 
 Quinn Cutler is 16 years old when she discovers that she is pregnant. The thing is, Quinn has never had sex or done anything close to it so has to try and figure out the missing pieces of her virgin pregnancy. As the story breaks, Quinn is soon inundated with crazed fans who think she is carrying the next Messiah. Quinn has to figure out if she is blocking out something terrible that happened to her, resulting in a pregnancy, or if she could have actually had an immaculate conception. 
 This book is quite sweet and fun, despite the rather heavy topic of Quinn's pregnancy. The story starts more or less straight away with Quinn finding out about the pregnancy within the first few chapters and I liked that there wasn't a big build up to the story. I liked Quinn's family for the most part, especially her mom who immediately becomes very present in her life when the pregnancy is revealed. I also really enjoyed reading about Quinn's boyfriend Jesse and how supportive he is of her, even when some things are revealed that make him upset. 
 I liked the theme of the magical realism in this book though it was hard to figure out if it was magic or if Quinn was a bit messed up. Because she definitely seemed a bit odd at times. Even though Quinn is quite sweet, after a while I felt a dark undertone of the book that made me uneasy. I wasn't sure if the book would end up being magical or if it would turn out that Quinn had been hurt and blocked it out which was just such an upsetting thought. So that definitely made me feel uneasy for a lot of the second half of the book. 
 Overall, I did like the story but I was missing a connection to it and the characters so I gave it a three star rather than a four star."
5,"Re-read before seeing the new movie and reading all the books that are out now about the Fitzgeralds. I read this in high school and didn't remember much about it, so this was like a fresh read."
4,"I was iffy on this one after some disappointment s with the first book, but I actually really liked it and didn't put it down from start to finish."
4,"Very dark and complicated, but almost too easy on the plot line that would have made the book five-stars for me."
4,"It is not often I can say a book turned my world view on edge but this one did. This is the story of a boy, David, who, because of a surgical accident as an infant, lost his penis and was raised a girl until he was 13 or 14. The gender reassignment never worked on him: he was always aggressive, butch, eschewed ""feminine"" things, etc. He never felt like a girl and when he finally found out the truth, he felt like everything finally made sense. 
 The book is well written and very interesting. It doesn't just focus on his life but spends quite a bit of time talking about gender reassignment research, the lives and opinions of intersex (hermaphrodite) people who were raised as a different gender than they ended up adopting, the politics involved with gender reassignment at the time of this incident, and biological theories of gender. The author appears to try to be objective but the horror of what this boy went through is so pronounced, it's hard for Colapinto to remain neutral. He very much makes the psychiatrist, John Money, who initially recommended the gender reassignment into Dr. Evil and, if the text is correct, it certainly is good and just that he does. If everything in the book is true, I don't know why Money isn't in jail for child endangerment and pedophilia. 
 So why did this book set my worldview asunder? Because I was raised to believe that I am more than my genitalia, that I am capable of doing and being anything I want to be. Just because I'm female doesn't mean that I will like makeup or dresses. Just because someone is male doesn't mean they will be aggressive and like sports. I grew up believing that the only differences between boys and girls was a matter of size, musculature and genitalia. 
 But this book talked about the research that shows that just small amounts of testosterone introduced into the uterus during pregnancy can make a girl much more aggressive, masculine and even gay. This boy always felt wrong, never felt like a girl, even though he was told he was one. I've always felt like a girl, even when I hated wearing dresses. I hate makeup and have never had any desire to join a sorority or be like Barbie. But I am also not violent or aggressive in any way. And I am bisexual. 
 So what makes a woman a woman and a man a man? It's more than muscles and it's more than genitalia. But it's apparently at least partially rooted in biology and genetics. So I am propelled to do more reading in this area, especially on the subject of transexuals and intersexuals. It's definitely food for thought."
3,"Braine's Talk Supe review 
 As far as LOVE SQUARE the book is concerned, I'm torn. The last time I read something similar to this was Jennifer Schmidt's Risking It All, and I remember Debbie and I were really discombobulated by the whole thing. Still I persevered reading despite my personal opinion about the topic because of the writing. It's a lot like reality TV, you know it's bad but it's so addictive you can't look away. Plus I'm curious about the whole LOVE SQUARE thing and the final outcome of these entangled relationships. 
 To summarize, I'm not a fan of Sam or Aiden. These two have some serious issues to work out and I hope they won't brush this ""hiccup"" under the rug. As for JIngro... THANK YOU for riling me up and giving me a story that evoked such a strong reaction from me. Whether or not I support the plot of LOVE SQUARE is immaterial at this point. We both know the topic is going to be a controversial one. In any case, you did a good job in getting this reader emotionally and mentally engaged, I may not like Sam but my gripes are a testament to your skill with the keyboard. Keep pushing!"
5,Very romantic!
4,"This was an absolutely adorable modern-day version of Pride and Prejudice for YA. The drama was toned down a bit from the original version, but overall I really enjoyed seeing this author's take on the story and looking for all the parallels (and in some instances, differences) that she used. It was cleverly done, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I'll definitely be looking for more from this author."
3,"Loved the purple and detailed art and the main theme, but the story itself lacked something."
4,"The Weed That Strings the Hangman's Bag picks up a little more than a month after The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie leaves off, so it was good to read them consecutively. It's summer in Bishop's Lacey, the little village outside of which eleven-year-old Flavia de Luce lives with her father and two older sisters in the old family manor, Buckshaw. Flavia's relaxing in the churchyard when she sees that she has company: it turns out that the van of a famous puppeteer, Rupert Porson, has broken down, and he and his assistant are stranded. The vicar convinces them to put on a show while they wait for the mechanic to fix the van, and Flavia's roped into helping them set up and settle in: they've been given permission to camp in the field of a neighboring farm. The farm belongs to a couple whose young son was found hanged in the woods five years earlier, and they've become reclusive since then: Flavia has a more-than-a-little creepy encounter with the woman of the house, which makes you wonder what other creepiness has happened on/near this farm, and what other creepiness is still in store. 
 As with the last Flavia de Luce mystery, in this one the stranger who arrives in town dies soon after--and turns out not to be a stranger at all. And once again, Flavia has a role in unraveling how the ""stranger"" is connected to Bishop's Lacey, and why he's ended up dead. 
 I am (still) fond of Flavia and her boldness and cleverness; passages like the below crack me up: 
 ""You are unreliable, Flavia,"" he said. ""Utterly unreliable."" 
 Of course I was! It was one of the things I loved most about myself. 
 Eleven-year-olds are supposed to be unreliable. We're past the age of being poppets: the age where people bend over and poke us in the tum with their fingers and make idiotic noises that sound like ""boof-boof""--just the thought of which is enough to make me bring up my Bovril. And yet we're still not at the age where anyone ever mistakes us for a grown-up. The fact is, we're invisible--except when we choose not to be. (p 112) 
 I like the little world of Bishop's Lacey, and I feel like Bradley's writing is better in this book than the last one--or maybe I was just paying better attention--I really enjoyed the descriptions of, say, the cool damp forest and all its plant life, or the wonder of looking down from above at a well-constructed puppet theater, the magic of it. And, like with The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie, I like the conventions of the mystery, the way different characters, many with a motive, are introduced, and the way you stay guessing. I read this book over the course of a few days when I was sick with a nasty cold, and it felt like perfect curled-up-with-a-blanket reading."
3,This book detailed a really interesting aspect of gaming that I didn't really know existed. I liked the main character and how she was portrayed.
4,"Quick and entertaining. A simple and interesting premise. Pretty funny. Picked it up on a whim. Mostly listened to the audiobook, which was well-done. Bought the sequel immediately. I'd recommend it, for something light."
2,"This was good. Really fast-paced, at times very funny, and even a bit moving. 
 But it felt like it was lacking something. Maybe it could have stretched itself a little further, taken a few more risks."
5,"""What I don't understand,"" she says, ""Is why such a clever and useful girl as yourself, Puck, would waste so much time looking like an idiot or being dead?"" 
 I have to say, it was HARD to choose an excerpt to pull for this review. I could seriously paper this review with quotes that made me smile, moved me, brought me to tears, and had me falling out of my chair with laughter. This is quite honestly the best book I've read in many years. This book keeps up such an amazing pace through the whole thing. It feels like the intensity grabs you from the very beginning and refuses to let you go. Don't let it! This is an amazing ride! 
 ""I try to think of what I can say to comfort him. I don't even know if he wants it. I don't know if I'd want to be comforted, if I'm being honest. If I'm being forced to eat soot, I want to know that somewhere else in the world, someone else has to eat soot as well. I want to know that soot tastes terrible. I don't want to be told that soot's good for my digestion."""
2,"I really wanted to like this book... 
 It was getting good at the 75% mark, but then something happened. It felt like when you're on a really good date, and then the person says something that just completely turns you off from them. Ugh. :|"
4,"Richelle Mead really knows how to write. It was just so nice to see all the characters again. Will miss them so much! 
 Review in Swedish at Boktycke."
5,"Afrodyt's review posted at Guilty Pleasures Book Reviews 
 Sela Halstead is the survivor of a horrific attack and now she's hell bent on revenge. After years of picking up the pieces of her shattered psyche, and then watching her assailants prosper very publicly, Sela has formulated a plan to bring them to justice all on her own. 
 Beckett North is the brains behind the Sugar Bowl brand. He partakes of the sweets offered but never over indulges. When he spots Sela at a party he is immediately captivated by her and willing to do whatever it takes to snatch her up. While the attraction and sexual chemistry between these two are off the charts, neither one of them are intending to make it more than that, but as they spend more time together their walls begin to crumble and they begin to feel so much more. 
 This story is captivating, intelligent and full of intense emotion that is perfectly calibrated. I love how these characters interacted with each other, how blunt and pragmatic they were. There was an underlying intelligence to Sela and Beck's relationship that kept me on the edge of my seat. It wasn't quite a cat and mouse game, but neither one ever truly let their guard down but they fell for each other anyway. This story ends in a cliffhanger, yet I found myself grateful that there is more of this story to be told. The respite from the bowstring tight tension is also welcome until August, when the next installment, Sugar Rush, is released. 
 Review copy provided for an honest review."
4,Series as a whole: 4-5 stars.
4,"Good Young Adult book. There is a bit more violence than you would normally think to see in the genre but nothing approaching horror. 
 My previous experience with books written in first-person has been limited to detective-style novels so while I was able to get into the books it was a little off-putting at first. Otherwise the writing was fine and as it turns out, first-person was probably a good choice. 
 The plot moves along quickly and the individual scenes are well paced. It makes complete sense to me that there would be a movie made from this book as the pacing is very similar to modern action/adventure films. 
 You can read plot summaries in other reviews but for my part while it is a classic hero's journey, it was told in a way that seemed fresh and modern."
4,"I'm really at a loss about how to describe my feelings for this book. On one hand, it was almost certainly going to be a disappointment compared to The Thirteenth Tale. It was missing the drive of that novel, and I finished it feeling like it was just a study in atmosphere. On the other hand, I ADORE that atmosphere and I loved reading about Victorian mourning practices. I expected it to build up to something greater than what it ended up being, but that doesn't make it bad. This isn't one that I can wholeheartedly recommend, unless you love Gothic lit, but it's very well done Gothic lit."
5,"Brilliant characterization in a kick-ass story. Steampunk, a mystery that works, and a romantic triangle that is emotionally wrenching and compelling. Can't wait to read the next, or listen, since I listened to the excellent audiobook."
5,"Wow. I spent all day reading this book and finished it in a flood of tears. It is a truly beautiful, tragic story following a young girl during Nazi Germany. I wouldn't say this book is fast paced or action packed, it's more of a collection of short stories which merge together - in a way, I feel this enabled me to develop a stronger connection to the characters as you followed their lives. It is a very sad book, but one I think everyone should read."

 Incredibly intricate, imaginative, and genius! Steve Toutonghi definitely had his work cut out for him when he pursued this endure. I am in awe with the complexity of the plot, characters, and world-building. After first, you feel as if you've been thrown under the bus. New characters with new abilities. A new world to explore with new laws, terms, and technologies. It is always good to have a notebook sitting by when you dive into a story as details and complex as this one. The entire concept is fascinating and thought-provoking. To imagine living with three or four other people who are closely connected and preform tasks that can benefit or injure the group, is incredible yet frightening. 
 Though Toutonghi's writing is great, I found it to be a little too technical, wordy, and slightly confusing. It definitely takes a took chuck of the book for my to fully understand and comprehend what term meant what. I wish there were more explanations, or at least, less vague description. I found this book to be very intriguing."

5,"I loved this sequel. 
 I loved the new characters. I loved the story line. I loved the twists and turns. I loved the werewolf lore. I loved not knowing for sure who was good and who was evil. I even loved the cliff-hanger ending. I thought this was better than the first book in the series. 
 Perhaps it was simply because I was sick today in bed and this book took my mind off the miserable state of my body? Or perhaps it is because this is a fabulously written book? Or perhaps it is because this is the kind of book I enjoy reading? I don't know for sure but I do know that I loved The Lost Saint and can not wait for the final book The Savage Grace to be released in March. 
 Rating: 5 Stars - I loved it!! 
 Content: More content than I remember is The Dark Divine - language and violence. Talk of ""doing it"" but focuses on Graces decision to wait for marriage."
3,"I didn't love this book, but it certainly made me not hate Hemingway's writing, which I always have ever since high school. I loved ""Hills Like White Elephants"" because I love good dialogue, but so much of his stuff is just lost on me. He's really the only expat I don't read. 
 But there were some good parts of the The Sun Also Rises that only book lover can appreciate. The dialogue is really amazing; I honestly think it's Hemingway's strong point. He's repetitive and often nondescript in his scenes and characters, but his dialogue is realistic and it flows so neatly. I also liked the bull-fighting, although that seemed to be the only thing Hemingway wanted to describe and he went into hell of a lot of detail. 
 My issue is that I can never stay interested long enough to get a good grasp on his characters. And characters are pretty important. I know they drank and traveled and slept a lot, and that's pretty much it. 
 Couldn't the whole book just be Jake, Mike, Cohn, and Brett talking?"
3,"2.5 Stars 
 It's hard to talk about a book with a secret, especially when keeping ""that"" a secret is key to the enjoyment of the book. So I will try my best to express my feelings while keeping it vague. Wish me luck! 
 BLACK LIES starts off hitting all my ""NO"" buttons. The heroine, Layana Fairmont, is an heiress. Her family wants her to find a respectable husband of good social standing and lots of money. She is completely against that, and is biding her time to rebel against her families' wishes until she meets exactly the man they want for her and falls madly in love. 
 Brant Sharp is a billionaire and a tech genius. Self made fortune, super intelligent and completely focused on only her. But with a secret. A secret that takes over and changes his relationship with Layana after she realizes what it is. And a secret that pushes Layana to have her own secrets and lies. 
 I wasn't immediately invested in the characters. From the very beginning, their whirlwind romance didn't completely draw me in, but it wasn't bad either. They had some chemistry. 
 Now lets just say if you are not into reading books about cheating, then you may get annoyed by this book. Up to 80% I felt like I was reading a different version of book I've read before. As much as cheating can get on my nerves, I don't mind pushing my limits and seeing it done justice. It has worked for me in the past. But it's not a topic to brush off lightly and push it aside. It can seriously destroy people's lives. That being said, cheating is not my favorite thing to read about. 
 But here is my biggest issue with this book. No, not the cheating. I love reading a good paranormal romance and suspending my belief to enjoy those stories, but I'm not a fan of having to do that with contemporary romance. And to fully enjoy this book, that had to happen for me. And I just couldn't do it. Yeah, there's a twist at the end. What I thought when I originally found out what it was: ""ok, this could be interesting."" But then the most illogical happened. And when I can't believe something would happen the way the story goes, then you loose me. 
 When an author touches on topics that are serious in nature, I like to see that they've done their research. That research should show in their work. Taking a liberty here and there on something minor is ok (again unless your liberties entail fangs and blood drinking and shifting). But when a liberty is taken that is big enough that it changes the course of the story, or explains events away to make your story easy to get to an HEA, just a big no no for me. This is a personal thing, I guess. I love being shocked by authors! But my brain just knew there was no way it could honestly happen the way it's told. As shocked/annoyed as I was reading the ending, I was actually also annoyed reading the final note which states that yes, liberties were taken.

5,"I went into this book with high expectations, and Wonder met them. I absolutely wasn't expecting the different POVs, but they were merged so well, that I didn't really mind. The only thing I had a problem with was Justin's POV. It didn't have correct grammar (the first letter in a sentence was never capitalized, and there were no quotes around dialogue, etc.) and I never understood why. Was it clarified and I just skipped it over? 
 Either way, this is a phenomenal coming-of-age novel. Due to the fact that it's almost midnight, I shall leave it to this puny review to tell you to read the book."
3,"I have almost no idea what's going on, but I find myself enjoying this story anyways. 
 Obviously Kestrel and Arin will be reunited and live HEA, but I'm interested in seeing him come around and seeing how she gets out of her current situation. I'm actually kinda excited for the next book haha"
2,"I have a ton of feelings about this book but I'll be brief. 
 I've never liked the The Mortal Instruments series as much as The Infernal Devices. And I started reading TMI first. But I always get wrapped up in the hype and I always buy the next book of TMI right away. I had a goal at the first of the year to finish this whole series. I have two books left and I'm kinda dreading them. 
 Simon went from annoying side character who would never die to double-timing jerk main character. I've never liked him but now I hate him. 
 Maia went from kick ass female to so freaking frustrating, I wanted to throw the book at the wall. 
 Clary didn't seem to be a main character in this book. I wish she was in this one more but it seriously seemed like Simon's book not Clary's. That made me sad. 
 Jace is now needy and all, I can't live without you. I need you forever. Oh,I'm not good enough. She'll leave me. 
 Just... that pisses me off so much. I hate fictional characters like that. 
 I feel like the series would have been better off if it just ended after three books. It felt like a whole lot nothing was going on in this book and what actually made the whole book left forced and kinda stupid. 
 There was one scene towards the end that was so much like the season three finale of Supernatural, it pissed me off. Supernatural is my favorite show ever and it felt like Clare was stealing a whole scene from the show. 
 Overall, I wasn't impressed with this book. It was boring and forced and I could have gone my whole life not reading this one and the series would have been better off without it. 
 And there's still two more books."
4,"""And because we are human, we feel it all-- the anger, the sadness, the fear, the resentment. Regardless of how many people tell us everything will be fine"" 
 This book was really cute and inspiring. This is one of the very few books I've ever read that is written in verse, and it's so refreshing and different. I saw so,some on YouTube post a video about this book and saying how underrated this is and so at 1am I spontaneously decided to start reading it. Here I am an hour later, and I finished reading it. Since it's written in verse it makes this book seem really short and sweet which makes it a very quick read. 
 I love the way this book discusses fate and how we don't really understand our own fate until we've seen someone else's up close and personal. We take things for granted so often and don't appreciate all that we have until we realize how difficult things are for others. I also love the relationship between I Cade and Amber. It's just very cute and innocent and it never felt fake or forced. They both have personal problems that they want to escape from which is understandable and I enjoyed reading their romance. I love how they would say ""have you seen that movie?"" and they would know what movie they were talking about. I loved their obsession with the jelly beans, and building sand castles, and visiting the light house, and flying the kite on the beach. It all had a very summer-y vibe which I really liked. I like how they leave everything up to fate. Heads we do this, tails we do that. It's spontaneous. I also love this quote: ""My dad told me that my feelings wouldn't last forever. He said one day, though it's hard to imagine, they'd be replaced by new ones. Good or bad, they would be replaced. I think about that and see my dad is probably right"" That is so true. Whatever we stress about today will not even be on our mind at all in a few years. The things we spend so much time worrying about and stressing over really won't matter all that much in the long run. It opened my eyes to this idea that life really is too short to worry about the pointless shit. I do it all the time. It's a really bad habit and a hard one to break, but this book was inspiring. 
 I would love to take one day away from my life and spend it at the beach and enjoy a summer romance. This book was like a dream. I liked it a lot."
2,This book started to irritate me on page 55. How could anybody be so cruel and not get a sick person - especially one's own mother - the medical treatment they need?!
5,"4.5 but rounding up. 
 Am I heartless? Because I didn't cry. The ending was just perfection. I really loved this book and both Lou and Will!"
4,"This was really good! I loved all the history involved, as well as the characters. I'm looking forward to the next book in the series."
2,"This book toyed with my feels.... and not the good ones. 
 To summarize: Daniel/Bastian/Sebastian was captain of the ship The Oblation, and he spent his days consuming ungodly amounts of alcohol and smoking. His nights, however, consisted of women - willingly or hired. He woke up one night to his ship sinking. He scored a life raft, and ended up saving one of his passengers from drowning - Raine. He had ironically noticed the petite beauty earlier on his ship. Now, they are stranded together when all he wants is a stiff drink and for her to shut the #@*& up. 
 Did I like Daniel Sebastian? 
 Well, yes and no. His background was extremely interesting and unique. I loved how knowledgeable he was about survival. I also really loved how flawed his character was. But, sometimes, I felt like he was three different people wrapped into one. The first one was extremely strong and resourceful. He kept calm and always knew what to do. The second one was extremely emotional. He was a blubbering mess that was always living in the past. And the last one was a raging asshat. He was always blinding with rage, and would not listen to anything. Do you see how different these personality traits are? I adore a man that isn't afraid to show emotions, but he was all over the grid. And the way he treated Raine? 
 ""Yeah, there is something you can do,"" I said coldly, turning my glare at her. ""Come here and blow me. That would probably ease a bit of my tension - especially if you swallow."" 
 Charming. Especially since they had just met when he made this statement. 
 And Raine's character irked me. I liked her in the first few chapters. She kept her distance and stood her ground. However, the closer her and Bastian got, the more I wanted to slap her too. No, I didn't say that wrong. I wanted to slap her too. Some one please tell me when it is acceptable to treat someone like shit just because you have had a rough go! One minute he was treating her like an ignorant child, and then the next he was sobbing into her lap. All the while, Raine is there to console him and give him a pep talk just so he can go back to verbally abusing her later. 
 (view spoiler)[The part where Raine is almost abducted by a group of men actually made me ill. Well, let me clarify that. How Bastian reacts after he rescues the her from the men made me ill. You just rescued the love of your life from a group of men who you had seen push her shirt up and roughed her up. Instead of consoling her, you throw her down and have sex with her to make you feel better as she clings to you while hysterically crying. Screaming that she is yours the entire time you are pounding into her. Yeah, that's what Bastian did. Charming x2. (hide spoiler)] 
 Now I will add that once Bastian comes to terms that someone can actually care for him, it does get better. But for me, the damage had already been done and I was over it. Verbally abusive alpha male turned to sickly-sweet prince charming. I'm not buying it. 
 Besides the issues I had with the MCs, I really disliked that there were some major coincidences in this book. Bastian and Raine were both involved/affect by something. How ironic. *Eyeroll* 
 2 stars. And I'm only giving it that because I liked that it was a male POV book; it was such a shame it was Bastian Stark."
5,"Having watched the movie (which is so-so, they couldn't ruin the story, yet they missed much from the book) I just had to read it again. 
 I already read it twice before, together with the original story (which has the best surprise at the end ever) and the sequels and yet it still feels fresh and fantastic."
3,",,I use the tools in my arsenal,"" Ethan said. 
 If my boyfriend called me ,,tool in his arsenal"", I would kick his ass. But it Merit is okay with that, then great for her. It's also cool if she thinks that the way Ethan is treating her is okay. It's her choice. Whatever. 
 Other than that, Blood Games has it all. Murder investigation, GP trouble, Ethan being an ass, side characters not having enough space to show their full potential. Just like every other Chicagoland Vampires book. 
 Maybe if I read these books when they came out (meaning with months between various installments), I would have liked them. But as I've read them all in a month, they just seem too similar and not at all original. 
 That being said, I will probably take a break from Chicagoland Vampires for a time being and maybe I will like the next installment more if I put some space between me and this series. Maybe I need a change. Or maybe I need to find some series that will disappoint me more than Chicagoland Vampires to appreciate its full potential 
 Also, 
 I won't review this series anymore until it gets exciting and original again and stops constantly disappointing me."
4,"Carly Vega doesn't exactly lead the life of a typical teenager. She and her brother Julio live alone, trying to stay under the radar so that nobody realizes that their parents are nowhere to be found. The Vegas, illegal immigrants who led a productive and quiet life, were deported to Mexico, leaving their two oldest children alone. Now, Carly and Julio work themselves to exhaustion trying to earn enough money to smuggle them back into the country. Carly hasn't really had a childhood, because every time she tries to do something for herself, she's met with disapproving glares and lectures. That's just the way her life is, until she meets Arden Moss, a former high school sports star who is dealing with his own familial issues. Together, they'll learn to be true to themselves instead of blindly following their family's orders. 
 I was actually fairly surprised at how much I liked this book. I honestly thought that it was going to be your typical young adult romance, in which boy and girl fall in love, boy and/or girl does something stupid, angst ensues, and then at the very last second, boy and girl fall back in love. That's not what I got, not at all. In fact, Joyride is more a story of the impact of illegal immigration than anything else. The story of Carly's family is devastating, and unfortunately all too common. With everything that you hear about in the news, it's almost overwhelming to read about the struggles that she and her brother go through to earn enough money to smuggle their parents back, not even knowing whether it will work this time. 
 And then on the other side of the novel, we have Arden Moss. On the surface, Arden Moss is a former jock who used to have it all. Then he just threw it all away to turn into a slacker. But is that really what happened? Arden is still reeling from his sister Amber's death, and he harbors a lot of resentment toward his father for failing to get her the help she needed for her mental illness. And this is another big issue tackled in this book. Mental illness is a real concern for a lot of people, and unfortunately, many people feel that if you pretend that it doesn't exist, it'll just go away. But that's not the reality, and we see the consequences of that attitude in Amber's suicide. 
 I was so surprised when I was reading this book that it wasn't just another vapid teenage romance. It tackles big, important, relevant issues in a great way. I thought the writing was great, and actually really enjoyed that the narration changed from first person to third person, because I got a sense that we were inside Carly's head, but kind of watching Arden from afar. I'll be on the lookout for other books by Anna Banks, because this book was such a pleasant surprise. 
 Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for the free copy!

0,"Ayn Rand angers me a little. I can't properly say why. Probably because she's so damning eloquent. Her eloquence is a sky scraper and I'm just a hot air balloon lucky enough to fly up to her staggering heights. 
 What's even better is her conception. The fountainhead is brilliantly conceived. All with the intention of discussing objectivism. And what better way to discuss this than through aesthetics? And what better area of aesthetics to select than architecture? 
 Roark the main character is Randian Objectivism made alive. An architect with completely unconventional, but practically perfect designs, he gets laughed at by an establishment that refuses to believe that anything could replace the classical styles of building. The whole theme surrounds this idea of design for the sake of practical considerations and truly objective appreciation versus design for the sake of impressing others; art that relies on the herd mentality of self affirmation, rooted in unreality. 
 Roark is a robot; a revolutionary that neither fights nor gives up. He is not human. The Fountainhead is not realistic at all. Rand's idea of perfect, stand alone objectivism is riddled with so many contradictions that it falls in on itself, even in the book. 
 But where the book does hit home is in giving you an idea of what objectivism is all about. How difficult it is to be completely objective. And WHY we must be objective to begin with. It's a crusade against all pre-existing notions, all subliminal influences; a crusade to force us to question our true intentions and ideas. 
 In the process it exposes the sad fact that perhaps precious few people really have original thoughts, notions and ideas. Accusing the majority of simply copying others. Leading xeroxed lives. Objectivism as Rand conceives it; as a stand alone philosophy, would never survive. But no other philosophy or way of life would ever succeed without it. 
 To be sure the book has parts I do not like. The mills and boon esque backshelf trash romance that happens between Roark and Dominique for instance. I understand the need for it. The story was set up like this from the beginning. It being a dopamine inducing saga of two men 'Kane and Able' style. But it didn't have to be so cheesy. 
 Some of her characters like Elsworth Toohey spout philosophical mumbo jumbo at the press of a button. Her 'intellectuals' are all people who haven't spoken a direct word in their lives. And everything they say is underlined by some ulterior motive. Virtuous characters don't survive long in the fountainhead. Or if they do, they just survive. Cringing and bowing down to the strong. 
 I only found the need to read half of this imposing tome before i got the general idea. The rest is probably predictable. No less compelling that the first half, i'll wager. But my time is probably better spent in other pursuits for now. It was an enlightening read though, and very gripping. Highly recommended."
1,"I did not have any high expectations for Salem's Lot because I'm not the biggest fan of Stephen King's writing. I thought it'd be a nice in-between read from other books and series I'm reading. I couldn't have been more wrong. 
 The story begins rather good. A writer heads back to his hometown to finish a book he's working on. In this hometown he witnessed something terrible as a kid and fled the town. He meets a nice girl after getting back, giving the story a nice twist of romance. So far so good.... 
 Then all of a sudden, when the main plot begins to develop, vampires come in and the whole book is ruined. Vampires where probably the worst thing to possible happen to a (thus far) good storyline. Each chapter became worse and worse and finishing this book was a torment. I did it and I decided that I will not be reading any more Stephen King for quite a while."
4,"Second Reading Review 
 A thoroughly interesting read, elevated by McKelvie's art. What bothered me on second reading was the protagonist... she is indistinct to me. Why is she depressed? Why does she gravitate toward the gods? Perhaps this will be answered soon. Overall I enjoyed it, though I was less enamoured the second time around. 
 Original Review 
 Original, unusual, wonderful. McKelvie's art is something special. Probably could have done without all the swearing, only because (at times) it felt like it was thrown in for effect. That aside, this was one of the best reads of 2014 for me. Definitely one to keep following, and another big win for Image publishing."
3,Undersea cowboys. This book is fun and exciting enough but that's about it. I have an obsession with all things ocean so I loved it. :)
5,"""Do you know what this is?"" I whispered, dangling it in front of her face. 
 She clamped her lips, eyes deathly cold. 
 I didn't need a reply. She'd know soon enough. 
 Unlocking the collar, I held the two ends and bent over her. Wrapping it around her throat, I moved from front to back, positioning myself to fasten it. I kept my voice low and soothing, embracing my cold ruthlessness again. ""It's affectionately known as the Weaver Wailer."" Using the special clasp--an irreversible clasp--I murmured, ""It's your gift from us. Jewels from the best of our mines. You should be proud to wear such wealth."" 
 Nila shivered as the lock snapped into place. 
 My shoulders relaxed. It was on. It was done. 
 Her option to leave had just disappeared. 
 ""You're ours now. Want to know why?"" 
 She whimpered, shaking her head. 
 Gathering her thick black hair, I ignored her plea for ignorance. I'd told her ignorance was bliss--which was true. But I meant to torment her. I wanted her to fully embrace her future. 
 Breathing gently on her neck, I whispered, ""Because once the Weaver Wailer is in place...there's only one way to get it... 
 Omg Jethro, you heartless jerk!! 5 stars def for Pepper Winters :)"
3,"I was so not looking forward to writing this review because I honest to god don't know how to rate it. 
 I liked it,-parts of it- the characters and plot were good. The girls bickering was bordering on annoying but they works past it which was good. I was really liking Kylie until Trey's little visit. (view spoiler)[ after which she decided kissing every guy available was a great way to go (hide spoiler)] 
 Which brings me to point two= the boy saga. 
 Don't get me wrong I like the guys, all of them really.Even Perry I think he's fun and totally adorable. 
 Derek I liked from his first appearance and he's a good guy,there isn't really enough of him to hate. 
 Trey I don't like. He's impatient, inconsiderate and just an overall ass.I do not look forward to any more of him.(Unless they kill him off-that could be fun) 
 Lucas.Well I happen to be a sucker for blue eyes and dark hair and I love kittens, so its safe to say Lucas could be a sack of potatoes for all I care,I like him.That kitten bit was just too cute. 
 As much as I liked these parts i just don't feel right giving it a four star rating. Not as much as because of the content but the execution.The characters kind of suck too."
5,"Voldemort is ISIS and Dumbledore is my hero in this book (although I accept that he is massively flawed) 'Lord Voldemort's gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can defeat it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust. Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open"" 
 Also this: 
 Remember Cedric. Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good and kind and brave, because he strayed into the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory"
5,"Oh god, I need the next book now! 
 All this ship needs now is Scarlet back with wolf, and a partner for Iko and it's a ship full of ships! 
 But seriously, I need Winter now, I need to know what happens, and how much Levana goes apeshit. I want to know more about Winter. 
 Argh, all the not knowing"
2,"So. Wow. This book has some serious hype behind it. I mean, it has a 4.24 rating with over 240K ratings. And really, the synopsis sounds like something I would really enjoy: 
 ""When Magic has gone from the world, and a vicious king rules from his throne of glass, an assassin comes to the castle. She does not come to kill, but to win her freedom. If she can defeat twenty-three killers, thieves, and warriors in a competition to find the greatest assassin in the land, she will become the King's Champion and be released from prison."" 
 Sounds pretty intriguing, right? Unfortunately, I don't think this book lives up to the hype. Not at all. From inauthentic characters to sketchy world-building to a dull plot, this book wasted a lot of potential. 
 Characters: 
 Celaena is the aforementioned assassin. Now, in my mind, I was expecting a bad-ass female character with an edge and an air of danger around her. Someone who is stealthy, quick-thinking, and maybe a little emotionally shutdown. But that is not Celaena. Honestly, aside from being told over and over again that she was this infamous assassin, I didn't see any textual evidence SHOWING it. She is portrayed as this kind, compassionate, witty, flirty, fashionable girl. It was all very surface-level stuff. She didn't have any internal conflict or moral ambiguity that I would expect from someone who had experienced the horrors we are told she experienced. It doesn't feel authentic at all. 
 Chaol is the Captain of the Guard, assigned to be Celaena's bodyguard. He was fine, but I don't really feel like I got to know anything about him, aside from the fact that he is hung up on Celaena and he's been friends with Dorian since childhood. 
 Dorian is the Crown Prince. He doesn't like the tyrannical rule of his father, but doesn't actually do anything about it because...reasons? He is portrayed as a ladies man, but he falls for Celaena after a couple of flirty exchanges. Again, like Chaol, I didn't feel like I got to know anything about him, his motivations, or his inner struggles. 
 World-Building: 
 I didn't feel like I got to know the world at all. It was confusing. It's obviously a fantasy, complete with magical elements/creatures (although we're only TOLD about magical creatures) but then Celaena finds 'The Walking Dead' graphic novels in the library and I felt completely confused. I've heard that starting in the third book the world-building really gets much better...I don't know if I can wait that long. 
 Plot: 
 Sigh. So...the plot of this book was supposed to revolve around Celaena competing against other shady characters in order to win a job as the King's assassin. The only problem? The competition is not a focus of this book at all. There are 24 (I believe) competitors fighting for this job, and each week they have a different Test, with one person eliminated each week. Only two of these tests are actually depicted. Two. Others are mentioned, but just in passing. What ends up becoming the actual focus of the novel is the love triangle (because of course there is a love triangle). 
 The love triangle was actually not terrible. Her interactions with both of them were entertaining. You could see her with either of them, and the two men don't hold any animosity toward the other. Unfortunately, the love subplot end up becoming too big a part of the book, to the detriment of the story. It felt very 90s-romantic-comedy. I mean, people are being brutally murdered in the castle but all Dorian and Chaol can think about is Celaena. 
 One more thing. There are so many filler scenes in this book that do nothing to drive forward the plot or develop characters. The big one for me is an entire chapter devoted to Celaena having her period and vomiting in front of Chaol because it hurts so bad...ummm...what the hell? It was totally unnecessary. I guess it was supposed to show her vulnerability or something, but it didn't work for me at all. 
 All in all, this book just didn't feel authentic to me. The characters (especially Celaena) didn't act in a way that was authentic to what we're told about them and there was no depth to their personalities whatsoever. I'm sorry, but just because Celaena likes to read and is a musical genius doesn't mean she's a profound character. 
 As I'm looking through this review I'm kind of wondering if I shouldn't bump my review down, but at the same time, I didn't hate EVERYTHING about this book and I feel like it has just enough potential for me to consider checking out the sequel... 
 EDIT: I originally rated this story at 3 (2.75) stars. The longer I thought about it, however, the less I liked it and the more I found that I really disliked. I still feel like the idea behind this book had potential, but the execution was just abysmal. I will not be continuing with this series, nor do I have any inclination to pick up her ACOTAR series."
5,Such a beautiful book. I love the interaction between the main characters! So heart warming and heart clenching at the same time!
3,"2.5 stars 
 This one had such strong potential but it fell completely flat. The writing style was disjointed and seemed to jump from scene to scene...even if the scene we were just in left you hanging. 
 I felt bad for the heroine, Jess/Jewel, but more times than not, it seemed like she was encouraging trouble to come find her rather than moving forward in her life. One prime example...the door knob on her dorm room was broken and it was taken campus maintenance forever to fix it. So if you were on the run because of something horrible your stepbrother did, would you let a broken doorknob go? Hell no!!! And that is one example of Jess/Jewel doing things that just made it hard to feel sorry for her. 
 Then here was Cas. He wanted her, claimed it was just for sex, and basically treated her like dirt. Then we find out who he really is and what his feelings are and the two Cas' don't mesh at all. I get that his job required a certain amount of acting, but at some point (especially given how long he'd been doing his job) you'd think it's be pretty hard to put on the dickhead act and not make your feelings know. 
 I'm bummed this wasn't the edge of your seat book that it had the potential to be."
5,"I've been watching the series on TV and fell in love with the characters. while the series is not true to the books (they never are, really), it doesn't do too bad a job. 
 This book is great. It's well written, complex and very interesting. Definitely recommend this."
5,Greatt! I loved it! I love how much more we got of Percy in the books tbh. Savoring every word of this series.
4,"I liked this book. Although it may not have been too creative, it is still a very entertaining read, and refreshingly honest. The characters are all so complex and diverse. Would I read more books by this author? Of course. Her Gemma Doyle series makes my favorite book list. Would I recommend this book to others? Yes I would, particularly teenage girls or people who were once teenage girls. All in all, a very interesting book. 
 See the full review on my blog, Awesome Book Assessment."
4,"Cute 
 This was one of those books I started and couldn't put down. I read it in breaks during meetings at work and waiting in line at the store and the moment I got home. I just really enjoyed this book. I enjoyed the way that Foster and Devon interacted and how Devon was just trying to figure life out. I liked her and Ezra and Foster and Ezra. I just really liked Fosters story and feel for him. I kind of think a sequel to this would be nice."
2,full review to come...
3,"It started off great. 
 I've heard of Pern alongside Narnia and Hogwarts so of course I was exited to try it. At first I was pleasantly surprised by how much darker it was than I had imagined.I'd pictured it mostly leaning towards the kids' side of the YA. While it was definitely edging to adults. 
 The first 1/4th of the book was absolutely wonderful. I was in love with Lessa, with F'lar, with their relationship and with the world. 
 However just at the time I thought would be the best part of the book it started going down hill. Unfortunately it continued that way for the rest of the book. 
 The training part of these books are usually my favorites, the part where the main character is learning all the rules and just coming to term with who she/he is. The first strike in this book happened when the author skipped over that. Suddenly it was two years later with no waning or indication. It was annoying and it kept happening till the end, the author skipping over the best parts with sudden time jumps. (in her writing not in the story!) 
 Then we had the relationship between Lessa and F'lar. I had pegged them to be one of the best couples ever because like all the best book couples they hated each other from the start. So I sat tight waiting for some awesome relationship development. Which I never got. It was all so sudden and weird and mechanical. There was absolutely nothing interesting about their relationship. That was strike two. 
 The third strike was the characters individually. F'lar turned from my first impression of him as awesome and sexy to possessive and creepy. Lessa went from strong and independent to annoying and stupid. She at least improved a bit at the end. 
 But the last and final strike was the treatment of women in this book. It was so offensive, and the funny thing was it was obvious that the author thought she was being such a feminist. That just made it worse. 
 In my experience there are two type of people who believe in equality. Those who actually believe it, they don't have to think about it, it's just there. Then there are those who think they are being feminists while in truth being offensive, these are the ones who say things like ""of course men can take care of babies too, it's just that women are naturally better at it."" or ""Women are by nature more delicate.They have a different kind of strength."" or the thousand other hidden sexist comments. 
 This whole book fell into the second category. For example, dragons chew a special kind of stone to produce fire. Which is of course their biggest strength. However if female dragons do it they can no longer reproduce. Isn't that wonderful? 
 Or the fact that female dragons mate with any male who can catch them in flight. That would be ok if dragons were considered animals, but when they can talk and have characters, it's not ideal. However that's not the problem. The problem is the fact that female rider will automatically sleep with who ever was the male rider! Then what happens? The next time her dragon mates she sleeps with the next rider. There is no mention of what happens if she doesn't want to. In fact there isn't a single paragraph about how she even feels about this entire ordeal. 
 Another example?Lessa didn't even know this before the first mating. Basically while she is lost in her dragon's mind, F'lar is having sex with her body. WHILE SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING. 
 If it's not rape I'm not sure what is. But does anyone comment on it? Does she even object? No. We don't even get to hear what she thinks or feels about this afterwards. NOTHING. Oh and also, she was a virgin. We also find this out in F'lar's pov. 
 Other examples? Women are the ones who cook and clean the Weyrs. Women can only ride queen dragons,even though there are thousands of the other kinds. Men go to battle and Women take care of their wounds. The list goes on and on. There was no equality here, it was just one stereotype after the other, and it made the book so annoying for me. 
 Overall it was more than anything a let down, both from the awesome stuff I'd heard about it and from the great beginning of the book itself."

While Professor Bolt is reckless and heedless of consequences, he is a well-known and popular personality among the fossil collection community. Samuel learned his love of fossil hunting from his father but he is eager for a time when he can strike out on his own and make his own name in the field. 
 Rachel Cartland's father is a respected Ivy League professor and the head of a university archaeology department. He tolerates Rachel as an able assistant but he is slow to accept her ambitions for a university education and her own work as an archaeologist. 
 Cartland and Bolt are bitter rivals but when they meet, Samuel quickly finds himself drawn to Rachel in a way he hasn't felt for other girls before. Rachel, meanwhile, is immediately thrilled by the way Samuel sees her both as an attractive young woman and as an equal. 
 Both the Bolts and the Cartlands arrive at the Badlands in search of an elusive rex--a king dinosaur that promises to be the largest fossil ever discovered. As rivalries flare and romance blossoms, both Rachel and Samuel will have to decide how much they are willing to sacrifice in pursuit of this once-in-a-lifetime discovery in Every Hidden Thing (2016) by Kenneth Oppel. 
 Every Hidden Thing is a fascinating standalone historical fiction novel. 
 While the time period is never stated explicitly, Oppel does an admirable job of setting the scene of the early 1900s when fossil hunting and archaeology gained momentum (and respectability) in the US. 
 Inspired a real rivalry (which Oppel explains in his author's note), Every Hidden Thing has been pitched as Romeo & Juliet meets Indiana Jones. While not as tragic as the former or as high action as the latter, this description is surprisingly accurate and will appeal to fans of both stories. 
 Written in alternating first person narration, this novel carefully builds both Samuel and Rachel's characters. By overlapping the narration at key moments, the motivations behind some of Rachel's calculating choices and Samuel's heedless actions are also carefully detailed. 
 Every Hidden Thing is a well-researched piece of historical fiction. Rachel and Samuel are immediately sympathetic but also remain convincingly grounded in their time as both characters grapple with limitations (Rachel's gender and for Samuel his lower class status) and the rigors of an archaeological dig. Recommended for fans of historical fiction, star-crossed lovers, and readers interested in dinosaurs and fossil hunting.

5,"I absolutely loved this twist on the fairy tale ""The Six Swans."" From the very start, the world of Sevenwaters and the surrounding forest that Sorcha and her brothers grew up in had me fascinated. The character building was wonderful, with Sorcha and each of her six brothers having their own unique personalities and parts to play within the household and family dynamic. Once Sorcha's father brought home the terrible Lady Oonagh and they had a son together, the new wife decided she wanted all of Sevenwaters to belong to her son...so she hatches a scheme and a spell and turns all 6 of Sorcha's brothers into swans. Sorcha, for her part, got away from the bad witch and goes through the story facing many hardships along the way but also finds her place in the world, all the while doing what she must to free her brothers from the terrible spell that has been put on them. Does she succeed in freeing her brothers? I will not say...What I will say is that you should read this book. I loved it. I loved the magic and the adventure...I also really loved the main character. I can't wait to read the next book in the series and find out if we learn what becomes of some of the other characters I really enjoyed- especially Finbar- Sorcha's and his special way of communicating intrigues me, and his ""sight"" is extraordinary- I really feel like a story with him as the main character could be great."
4,"Whoa so I've never heard of Madeline Sheehan when I decided to take a chance on this. I just read the blurb and it seemed interesting so I went for it. And lemme tell ya. BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE ! This author is on my auto buy list. 
 So this is not your usual romance. It's rough, raw and gritty. The main characters meet in jail actually where Deuce, 23 goes to visit his incarcerated father and he stumbles upon an adorable 5 year old Eva. Eva is on her way to see her daddy ""Preacher"" who is serving a 5 year sentence. 
 Eva is the just the most sweetest kid around, she's friendly and adorable and when she see's Deuce she immediately takes a liking to him and insist on meeting Deuces dad who is also serving a sentence at the same place. Eva leaves a HUGE impression on Deuce even with the 18 year difference he takes a liking to the adorable 5 year old (in a non creepy way I totally promise) 
 ""Name's Deuce sweetheart. My old man here is Reaper. It was nice talkin' with ya."" 
 She put her tiny hand in his and he squeezed. 
 ""Eva,"" she whispered. ""That's my name and it was so, so great to meet you too."" 
 He smiled. 
 She smiled. 
 The rest is history. 
 OMG wasn't that sooooo adorable ? Seriously that was kinda cute. So years pass and they are reunited several times when she's 12 and then at 18 when their relationship truly develops. Oh God their relationship was crazy and made my head woozy. Both grew up in an MC club and we know life in a motorcycle club is filled with crude and raw members so their relationship was anything but stable. 
 ""Can't fuckin' live without you. Want you on my bike and in my bed. Want my kids inside you. Want you by my side babe for as long as I got left"" 
 We all know little girls are born sweet and innocent, watching fairytales and dreaming of Prince Charming and being princesses right ? Well Eva didn't have that childhood because she grew up in an MC where criminal lifestyle was the norm. Moreover, being the president's daughter she ultimately winds up living this lifestyle and her life is anything but sweet and innocent. But as we see her grow, we realized that her childhood actually made her a stronger woman because she's been subjected to so much at such a young age that she doesn't take much bullshit from anyone. 
 Deuce, HOT DAMN !!!!!!!! He's rough, crude, dirty, rugged, handsome and a total alpha male of epic proportions. He treats women like dirt but his underlying qualities hidden deep inside makes him appealing and redeemable. I hated and loved his crude language and I was always like... oh no he didn't?. Ultimately I tried to hate him but I honestly couldn't. He's just so darn amazing. 
 ""Hey,"" I said softly and cupped his cheek. 
 ""Yeah?"" 
 ""What about your dream?"" 
 His face went dimples. ""I'm lookin' at it, darlin'."" 
 This is not your typical love story. It has crime, violence, crude language, rape and infidelity. I know that list sounds scary but I promise you it's not. It was quite intense and filled with raw and edgy scenes that made me root for Eva and Deuce at the end. 
 All I can say is READ THIS BOOK !"
4,"There were many occasions throughout this book where I wanted to slap Nevare for his stubbornness and almost willful ignorance; I was sad to see Robin Hobb using the ""but the character wouldn't consider X as an option, here, he'll explain why"" that many times. That said, I still thought this was a wonderful book, less plagued with timeline issues than the first. At no point did it get so frustrating I stopped reading, and that's a big pet peeve of mine. Still, Nevare doesn't seem to learn from his mistakes, and for some reason it's more annoying here than it was with Fitz in the Farseer/Tawny Man series. Definitely not a reason to skip the series, though."

 with I Want It That Way i was delighted to find a story dealing with real college young people problems, but i have to admit that the book was kind of boring, because it didn't deal with nothing else beside that and the main character's love life. lauren was not a character i was much interested in at the end of the first book, but i was curious about her problems. that's why i picked this book up soon after i finished the first one. 
 my biggest problem with this book was the same as with the first one: it didn't happen much. there was no more story apart for lauren and rob's and that was a bit slow sometimes too. in the end, the whole book felt like watching a soap opera where nothing mostly happens, but you cannot stop watching just in case something happens. but the book had some advantages: there were hot, steamy scenes, and the love story was sweet. 
 i did like robert, he was such a great guy. i know he is hot because it was told, but i never felt it. he was so honest and had so many self-esteem issues i couldn't quite believe that he was soo handsome. i felt sorry for him because of the way his family treated him (or it was said they treated him). if he knows his limitations, he is much smarter than most of the people out there. i hated that he didn't dare because he thought he wasn't enough and loved the way lauren was able to support him and make him believe in himself. 
 sadly i didn't like lauren herself as much as robert. i thought that a great part of her didn't match what she told us she was. she kept her anxiety issues a secret, but at times i thought she was too outgoing, too extroverted and social to have such problems. probably she was overcompensating. anyway, it felt weird to me. at moments, i also felt like the issues and being a nerd were kind of tied together like one was the consequence of the other, but that could have been my appreciation. 
 all in all, i think the book is a nice contemporary romance fiction for adults. this one felt more for adults than the previous one, but probably because the problems the main character had to deal with weren't as material and tangible as money, scholarship and college. nevertheless, it was a good, entertaining read. 
 thank you to netgalley and harlequin for providing me with a copy of the book"
4,"Very good first book in a series. I'm happy to have discovered this author. Think Vince Flynn meets James Bond. I was initially upset that the nominal villain is an oil tycoon fighting against a green-energy initiative, but this is essentially inconsequential to the plot (plus the book was written well before green energy has become a symbol of political cronyism worthy of a separate novel). You get all the elements: the plucky hero, the beautiful woman, the larger-than-life villain(s), the great international locations, and LOTS of action. Highly enjoyable, old-fashioned fun."
3,"The writing in this book was beautiful and lyrical, but the pacing was more like that of an adult book than a middle grade book. For something being compared to Harry Potter in its publicity, it was really lacking in action and intriguing dialogue. I gave up on it about 20% in, then decided to push on and finish, but it took me much longer than most MG/YA books. While I appreciate the true intricate nature of Barnhill's storytelling and recognize how pretty it was, it just doesn't hold interest like a successful MG novel should."
4,"White Cat is an exciting addition to Young Adult fiction. I am thrilled to see another series featuring a teenage boy as the protagonist. I rarely read books told from a male's perspective so when I do it's such a refreshing change. 
 I was completely engrossed while I read White Cat. Holly Black wove a creative and fascinating world. She addresses the issue of discrimination against a person because of something that isn't within their control. In this case it's discrimination against people who are born with the ability to perform curse work. It's a new release all young adult fans should check out and a series I'll definitely continue. I enjoyed spending time with Cassel. He is struggling with the guilt of murdering Lila and trying to cope with the death of his father and his mother's incarceration. Throughout the book we see Cassel's desire for a normal family and life. Things I'm sure most teens (and even some adults) can relate to no matter where their families fall on the normal spectrum. Cassel is definitely going on my list of favorite fictional characters. The ending of White Cat sets the story up perfectly for the next book without leaving the reader hanging. I'll be anxiously awaiting more adventures with Cassel."
4,"When I put this book on my to-read list, I was thinking of it as a sort of replacement for Harry Potter because I love that series. Nothing could ever replace it completely, but I thought this was up there for me. I enjoyed the different perspectives (especially the humor & footnotes from Bartimaeus) and I really liked the plot. It was something different than what I've read before and I'd like to keep following Nate and Bartimaeus (he'll obviously come back because the trilogy is named after him) and see what kind of trouble they get into next!"
4,"Tess lives two lives: the pretend life of a normal high school student, and her real life protecting her grandfather by keeping his secret and managing things at home. When her estranged older sister Ivy shows up, she decides to ""fix"" all Tess's problems by taking Tess back to D.C. with her. It turns out that Tess's sister makes a living fixing problems--for the most powerful people in the country. Tess inherits the ""fixer"" position when she is enrolled at a new highschool, full of the sons and daughters of the nation's most prominent families. But Tess isn't used to politics or the dangers of thwarting powerful people, and when people start dying, her own life might be in danger if she can't find the killer. 
 This is basically a teen-appropriate version of House of Cards. Or, in more literary terms, a John Grisham novel for teens. It's fast-paced, full of relationship twists and turns, and based in a world of politics and lies (though that last may be unnecessary repetition). 
 I'm not a big thriller reader, but I appreciated the solid build-up behind the mystery element of the story (even if I found the culminating ""scary"" part a bit forced). What sold the book for me, though, was Tess's relationships with the adults in her life; Barnes handles the trauma of a child surviving a beloved grandparent's decline into dementia with grace, and the resultant drama between Tess and her sister rings true because of this. The other secondary characters, Tess's new friends and enemies at her D.C. school, are all well-characterized in the sense that Barnes presents them as unique individuals in a limited time span, though I would have liked to see some of them developed a bit more. 
 I think this one will do really well with teen mystery readers, as well as fans of Ally Carter or Robin Benway."
2,"All the premises of this book are good. The reader will jum into the same London of Wendy and Peter Pan but there is no island and things are extremely different. London has been destoryed by a militar assualt lead by Germany. Born inside the conflict is the Horologia Virus, a illness that kills only the adults but not the children. 
 In a dystopic world with a bit o steampunk touch, Wendy tries to survive with her little sister and brothe. But London is running out of supplies and really soon they will have to find a new place where to go on with the survival. The city's streets are runned by the marauders lead by Hook : they're searching for children and for a cure for the Horologia. 
 Really soon, Wendy will have to face not only new and more strong versione of the virus, but Hook himself. 
 I don't know what is wrong in this book. It's a read... and it's a read. This book left me with nearly no impression at all, like it wasn't able to catch me inside its own story. 
 It's the first written by the authore, and I generally try to not be too much severe on first novels since I quite understand the struggle to give the best and not fulfilling the task. Anyway, I will probably read the second book because I want to know if the authore made some progress and how the writing style will go on. 
 The writing style was in fact a great problem. It was flat. It wans't able at all the call my interest out and say hello. It was like reading some kind of list. It could have been everything! A book or not, I would have not find the difference and that's one of the main reasong why I couldn't find my own bookish passion while reading. 
 I have to say the same thing for the characters. 
 And that's why I don't even know ho to talk about this book. It's kinda terribile when you read something that you actually didn't dislike that much but that didn't impress you. 
 So, this is an ugly book? 
 Yes. 
 No. 
 I don't really know. 
 But I'm sure that Everland is a dim novel. 
 All the characters don't manage to finde their space between the pages. They attack eachother, they act strange or don't act at all and the enemy isn't represented enough inside the book. 
 The worldbuilding also! It was like missing a piece, just a place that it's only a plain scenography where the plot is rying to develop. 
 There are many thing that should have been better and add in side the story to make it a good novel. 
 And this review seems so damn inconsistent because I don't really know what I'm writing"
4,"Though as a child, I very much enjoyed the many adventures of Tom and Huck, I recall having felt that I couldn't connect to them because I wasn't a boy. How different such stories would be if they were written presently! Would they be less male-centric? Would the characters have gender-neutral names? Who knows."
1,I quit. 7 chapters in and absolutely nothing was happening. So boring.
5,"Jesus......Hot. Sexy. Amazing read!!! I devoured this book. Ella Frank is a fantastic writer. Delicious series (Exquisite, Entice, Edible) and hot damn Logan is getting a story (winter 2013), YAY!!!!!"
2,"I read this for a Summer Reading Discussion I had to give. I found the book average. I liked the main character, Belly all right. I didn't care for her love interests. It also tried too hard to be like Twilight. The main character's first name was Isabel and really close to Isabella. There was too much drama in it and it could have been cut in half."
4,"An absolute thriller with a dash of humor in nearly every alternate page. For an author who has just started writing, Amish has written an amazing book. Irrespective of whether it is true or not, Lord Shiva has been wonderfully portrayed as a village simpleton. I especially loved the way Nandi was introduced to Lord Shiva. Nandi the bull as Captain Nandi, I would laugh randomly at that transformation freaking others around. 
 The one factor that reading this entire book enjoyable was that, unlike most foreign authors who combine multiple complex plots together, Amish has written the story in a linear format i.e. the next chapter continues where the previous ones left off. 
 This book has been perfectly crafted for Indian audiences and would recommend others who like mythological fiction to grab these. 
 A place I would recommend purchasing these books at awesome discounts for Indians would be Flipkart.com."
4,"4.5 stars 
 Just up front, there will be some minor plot spoilers in this review, but most of it is also revealed in the official synopsis of the book from the publisher. Any details of the plot I give, only cover the first third or so of the book. Still, if you prefer to go in completely cold, and have managed to stay ignorant of the premise of a book published several years ago, you may want to skip this review and just take my word for it that it's very good. Brutal and not really your run of the mill YA dystopian, but very good indeed. 
 Ok, if you're still reading, I'm assuming your fine with knowing the bare bones of the plot. Darrow works deep under the surface of Mars, mining for precious minerals. He is a Red, one of the pioneers and hard workers sent to Mars, told that their work efforts are crucial to aid in the terraforming of Mars and other planets for those left behind on Earth. Working conditions are extremely tough, hardly anyone lives to a ripe old age. Food is scarce, unless you live in the town that always seems to manage the highest quotas every month. Darrow's father was publicly executed after he encouraged some other workers to do a pacifist protest against working conditions, so he and the rest of his family have been careful to be model workers. Now Darrow's young wife Eo has started voicing dissent against the system and Darrow is worried. 
 When they are caught trespassing in a restricted area, both are sentenced to public flogging, to be broadcast on the video feed all around Mars. The ArchGovernor of Mars, the most powerful man on the planet, just so happens to be visiting as the sentence is to be carried out. Darrow takes his punishment stoically, then is shocked to realise that Eo is going to sacrifice herself to prove a point. Singing one of the songs of rebellion as she is being whipped, Eo is hanged and her death broadcast across the planet. Her last words are to ""Break the chains!"" Darrow is absolutely crushed and breaks the law by fetching down her dead body from the gallows and burying it somewhere hidden. He too is sentenced to hang, but wakes up after his execution, not dead at all. A resistance group tells him that Eo has become a martyr to their cause and they need Darrow to help them fight. 
 He discovers that he and everyone he knows has been fed a clever lie and that Eo's theories that they are slaves are absolutely correct. Mars was terraformed centuries ago, as were the other planets in the solar system. Above-ground there are huge and impressive cities where the Golds, the highest and most powerful caste, rule society. Dancer, a lieutenant of the resistance leader Ares, needs Darrow to agree to an audacious plan. They will turn him into a Gold and make him infiltrate the highest levels of society, helping to bring it down from within. Of course, it's not like they can just slap a wig and some contacts on him and send him off. Over the centuries, the various castes, from the lowest Reds to the very highest Golds, have been genetically engineered to become different species. People can't even breed across the castes without illegal surgery. Darrow has to go through an absolutely gruelling ordeal, having his body surgically transformed in a series of very dangerous operations. Then he has to pass the entrance exam to the Academy, where the Gold send their brightest and best children to be trained. 
 Of course Darrow survives his transformation, and of course he passes the exam to the Academy with unparallelled results. Once he's accepted, he comes to discover that the Golds don't coddle their children and the very first test he faces is a brutal one indeed. Having no choice but to do his very best or let down the entire rebellion, Darrow does what he must, although it breaks his heart to do so. While he is full of righteous anger against the Golds, he also hasn't been trained from birth to be as ruthless as them. Once he passes the first bloody test, he finds himself in a real-life strategy scenario along with the other candidates from House Mars who passed the first test. There are twelve houses, and the name of the game is to conquer the playing field. Each house has different resources and fortifications and only those most organised and clever will win. 
 I have seen Red Rising described as The Hunger Games meets A Game of Thrones. I can absolutely see why. There are teenagers fighting in a large arena, quite possibly to the death, and their actions are broadcast out to the world, because the better you do at the Academy, the better a career you are likely to have in the future. If you survive the year, of course. Red Rising is dystopia turned up to eleven. Pierce Brown has clearly been influenced by a lot of other writers, but compared to the stuff Darrow has to go through in just the first half of this book, Katniss pretty much has a walk in the park. The world building is much more complex, the societal structures that are keeping our underdogs down are oh so much more devious. 
 Society is divided into colours, with the Golds at the top, who rule all. Below them are the Silvers, who provide the finance and the innovation. There are the Whites, who are priests and priestesses and the Coppers who provide bureaucracy. The middle castes are all genetically engineered to be the best at what they do, be it science, programming, medical care, piloting starships or providing security. Darrow and his family are the absolute lowest of the low. They are low-Reds, born under ground, living their whole lives without ever seeing the surface. Fed the lie that their lives may be hard and mostly thankless, but they are providing a valuable and vital service to enable the terraforming of the galaxy, not really given the chance to question whether things may be different. 
 This book is classified as Young Adult, but I can only imagine that the reason for that is that Darrow is sixteen when the book begins. There are some pretty advanced concepts presented in this book and a lot of references that readers should be familiar with to fully appreciate the scope of the story. There is also some quite frightful brutality in the book, much more so than in other dystopian series I can think of. It's here that the comparisons with Game of Thrones are obvious. I have seen the series criticised for its treatment of female characters and the accusation that Eo is fridged early on to set the plot in motion. I do see how that could be problematic to some, but personally, this never struck me as an issue. Clearly something huge had to happen to motivate Darrow to join the rebellion. Eo didn't get too much characterisation before she's killed off, but she purposefully chose to sing the song that had her sentenced to execution. She was a woman with agency and not just pointlessly killed to make the male protagonist feel sad. To me, the fridging of a female character is when she, though no fault of her own, usually just because she is the wife/girlfriend of the hero, is killed pointlessly. That isn't what happened here. Eo chose to become a martyr. 
 I have also seen some accuse Darrow of being a Gary Stu, which is just preposterous. While he is absolutely a Chosen One, who thanks to various factors in his upbringing has made him stronger, smarter and more resilient than most other Reds, exactly the reason he's chosen by the Sons of Ares for such a deep cover mission, he has a ton of flaws and frequently makes some pretty decisive mistakes. Obviously, he learns from each mistake and becomes more skilled and adapts his strategies as he goes on, but if he didn't, he would just be an idiot. Still, even as he keeps getting better at the game he's forced to play at the Academy, he puts his trust in the wrong people and keeps acting a bit too impulsively to ever really be called perfect. His flaws are part of what make him interesting. 
 This book is a bit slow to start, before Darrow discovers the truth about the society he lives in and is introduced to the resistance plot the Sons of Ares has devised. It also lags a bit in the middle, during the war games at the Academy. Some sections there were a bit of a slog to get through. Mostly, this is rather relentless action and momentum and I am deeply impressed with the scope and world-building. I felt somewhat exhausted at times, reading the book, which is why I've chosen to read fluffy romance between each of the books in the series. I need a palate cleanser before I dive into the dark and brutal world of the Red Rising universe once more."
4,"The Instructions was about a suspiciously intelligent troubled middle-school kid, living in Chicago, who believes himself to potentially be the Hebrew messiah. Though I heartily disagreed with the kid's opinions about most things, I was very impressed by the logic and honesty of his reasoning. Also, Adam Levin's writing style made this book a pleasure to read. I really and truly enjoyed this book until the very end. If you need books with satisfying endings, avoid like the plague. (That's why I gave this book 4 stars rather than 5)"
4,"This book is super popular and talked about quite frequently. 
 The writing style is quite different, a little poetic. It does take some getting used to. I could see how soon people wouldn't like it. 
 It also just sort of throws you in to the story with a million different characters, and some flashbacks. Sometimes I didn't realise we had flashed back and I was a little disjointed. 
 I do think you should go into this book not knowing what its about. it makes it much more enjoyable. 
 I wasn't particularly fond of the main character, she was a little stupid if we're being honest. I get that she was just 15 but she and her cousins were living in a privileged little fantasy world. I thought the grand father and his conflict with his daughters was a much more interesting story than these spoiled teenagers. 
 I liked the ending. That's probably why I gave it a 4 instead of a 3. 
 A good book but not a favorite."
5,"This was one of the best books I've read in a long time. It's a page-turning interweaving of several stories about love, art, the movies, storytelling and, ultimately, life itself. The story begins in Italy in the 1960's, during the filming of the movie epic ""Cleopatra,"" and jumps back and forth in time to present-day Hollywood to World War II Philippines and with ""side trips"" to contemporary Idaho repertory theater, Edinburgh Festival Fringe and more. 
 It's a rare combo of a good read, funny, touching and meaningful all at the same time. Very satisfying and enjoyable!"
4,"OFFICIALLY AN ADVOCATE OF PYNCH. 
 Right, first order of business. After the awesome second book, Blue Lily, Lily Blue puts the focus back on the group's search for Glendower, now that Cabeswater has returned. A part of their search has them exploring caves in which they believe Glendower is buried and (view spoiler)[where Blue's mother disappeared to (hide spoiler)]. To further complicate things, Greenmantle (Mr. Gray's employer) arrives at Henrietta. 
 So, there was a lot of progress made in terms of their search. The team is now so much closer to unravelling the mystery of Glendower than ever. Everyone seems to have a clear role by now which complements each other well. Adam is now more in touch with Cabeswater, Ronan more confident when dealing with his dreams, Blue learning what she is and what she can do, Noah being the voice of reason, and Gansey who gave them all a purpose, finally ready to meet his King. The writing is still as beautiful and flawless as ever. 
 In the romance department, Blue and Gansey continue to tug at my heartstrings (and that's saying something because I don't normally do love stories). Fuck instalove, this is how every love story should be done. 
 (c) image credit 
 And then there's the case of Adam and Ronan, whose relationship/friendship grew so much in this book. I bet we're all wondering, ""Does Adam swing that way?"" Is the jury still out on that? Since The Raven Boys, when Ronan went back to save Adam from his abusive father, we saw that side of Ronan actually who cares for Adam despite their constant fights. And seeing it again here was just so wonderful and heartwarming. 
 Of course, being a Raven Cycle book, it never fails to end without leaving the readers wanting more. 2016 will be the year of the King, that's for sure."
2,"This is the second book I've read by Erdrich, and I can tell she's just not for me. I hear so much praise about this author and her writing. I tried, I really did, but the writing is too disjointed for my liking."
3,"IN THESE SILENCES SOMETHING MAY RISE 
 Oi, this book is a doozy! I read it months ago but only just finished its companion novel so I think I'm finally ready to organize my thoughts and write a review of this thing. I know I rated it three stars but that's really only in comparison to King's other work. Because compared with other writers, this book is far better, but compared to a lot of his other novels, it is just on the lower end of the Stephen King spectrum for me. Which really is too bad because it contains one of the most brilliant evil entities about which I've read. 
 TAK 
 This book is about a group of strangers who find themselves stranded in the Nevada desert in a small town called Desperation. Not just stranded in the desert, but locked up a rinky-dink sheriff's office because the local sheriff, named Collie Entragian, has gone totally berserk. He pulled these strangers over, found some cause to haul them off to the police station, and some of them even had to watch loved ones die in the process. Desperate to leave with their lives intact, these strangers have to work together to get away from this rogue man of the law (who keeps interjecting phrases such as Tak a la, Tak a wan into every day speech and who also seems to be literally falling apart at the seams). Among these strangers are the Carver family: Ralph, Ellie, and David who lost their young daughter/sister, Pie, at the hands of Entragian; a local drunk and veterinarian, Tom Billinglsey; tough but afraid Mary Jackson who saw her husband Peter murdered in front of her; and prize-winning legendary author Johnny Marinville, setting out on a cross-country voyage to gain substance for his new memoir: Travels with Harley. They are later joined by Marinville's road manager, Steve Ames and a hitchhiker he picked up named Cynthia Smith (who is also a character in Rose Madder). These strangers come together to try and figure out why they are the only survivors of whatever happened in Desperation, and why Entragian decided one day to kill everyone in the town. What they discover is a malevolent spirit who has hidden underneath the earth for centuries, waiting to get out and wreak havoc all over the place. 
 Tak is a hard entity to figure out. At first I kind of thought he was a demon, but that has too much of a mythological or religious aspect to it. Malevolent spirit also doesn't seem to work much. I think what I came to realize was that Tak is basically chaos. A non-corporeal entity whose sole purpose is to inhabit human hosts to create a world of chaos out of a world of order. But Tak soon realizes that humans cannot host it for long. The energy that Tak creates wears their bodies out too much, and any kind of flaws whatsoever grow exponentially in a short amount of time. Collie Entragian's pale skin made him susceptible to the sun, literally causing cracks in his body. Another human host had an unknown case of cancer which made his body break down from the inside out. Tak fed on the chaos of killing, of sex, of debauchery, of arguing. Its where it drew its life force from. TAK. IT. IT. TAK. I couldn't help but find similarities between two of King's most notorious evil beings. And as he kept referring to Tak as IT, I think he wanted the connections to be made. Just one more reason why I love this author. 
 No, Tak's real, it has a being. It had to get Ripton into the mine because it can't get through the ini--the well. It has a physical body, and the well is too small for it. All it can do is catch people, inhabit them, make them into can tak. And trade them in when they wear out. 
 The quote above just shows how totally complex this whole IDEA of Tak is. Can tak. Can tah. Ini. Things that exist only in Tak's world. A world that has just collided with Desperation, Nevada. 
 Anywhoo, I could go on and on and on and on about so many things because there are so many to digest. Tak meets its match in young David Carver, who is a very religious boy with a hell of a lot of faith. God speaks to David and uses him as a vessel to defeat Tak with the help of the others. Each of the strangers has their purpose, and David emerges as their leader. I think this is where the novel started to fail a little bit for me. The characters are all so CONTRIVED. As if they were all playing caricatures of types found in horror movies. David is the one with the faith. Johnny Marinville is the skeptic. Tom Billingsley is the token drunk. Cynthia and Steve provide the romance. Mary is the feisty alpha female. None of the characters rang at all genuine or true to me. And that was a major problem. 
 Wait, back up. Stephen King's characters didn't ring at all true? Something doesn't seem right about that. King is a MASTER of characterization. I've never known him to provide such hokey and caricatured characters before. Is this some kind of setup? Was this on purpose? King pits these characters against each other, in opposition. Particularly toward the end, Johnny the skeptic and David the faithful really seem to complete the circle with each other. I don't really know how else to describe it. They become connected in some way, either through God, or some other kind of energy that is antagonistic to Tak's. It is through these two characters that answers begin to appear. David represents life, faith, youth, destiny. Johnny, washed-up, sold-out old Johnny Marinville represents just that. Waste. Death. Endings. Selling Out. Giving In. 
 ""When a person stops changing, stops feeling, they die. The times you've tried to kill yourself since, you were just playing catch-up. Weren't you?"" And the child smiled at him with a sympathy that was unspeakable in its innocence and kindness and lack of judgement. ""Johnny,"" David Carver said, ""God can raise the dead."" 
 So now we are back to good and evil, God and Tak, faith and doubt. 
 I did enjoy this book and found it to be one of King's headier novels. I definitely liked it better AFTER reading The Regulators and taking both books as a whole. I'm also not sure I read this at the right time to fully digest it and uncover all its brilliance. I know its there, somewhere in the mines of Desperation, Nevada. I just came back with a lot of dust. I may need to go back down to the mine again to see if there is any gold."
4,"4/5. 
 Positive: This is a well crafted novella that adds intrigue and clever storytelling to the series. It continues the trend of being the perfect blend of fairytale and sci-fi. It was a refreshing point of view, to be privy to Levana's thoughts and feelings, and it was nice to finally get her whole backstory. 
 Negative: Like the other TLC books, it needed more worldbuilding."
5,"Very good, fitting ending to the trilogy... by far the best one, I think."
4,"What an absolutely adorable and heartfelt reimagining of 'Peter Pan' set 10 years after the events of the original story. It is delightfully whimsical and beautifully queer, borrowing from and twisting certain elements of the source material to create a narrative that builds onto, rather than completely reinvents, the original work. 
 This has all the magic and charm you would expect as well as some of the deeper darkness, but it becomes something so much more poignant and powerful when rewritten as a transgender narrative. This really is such a character driven novel, filled with so many beautifully raw and emotional moments, in particular when delving into Peter's trans/queer backstory and the origins of Neverland itself, and features a surprisingly sweet M/M romance with the maybe-not-so-evil-just-a-bit-misunderstood gay Captain Hook. I had some doubts going in, but honestly this relationship was written and handled so perfectly I kind of adored it in the end. 
 So yeah, I think I fell just a little bit in love with this retelling and this enchanting story about identity, transformation, acceptance and growing up. Highly recommend."
5,"I read this book with my reading buddy Tammy K. in the Shut up & Read group (Join!) so check it out here -->http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/8... and beware of the SPOILERS!!! 
 Okay, I was torn on how I was going to rate this book and I am still deciding lol so whatever rating I give this book is the decision I made towards the end of my review! 
 I have to say this is a new twist to the dystopian world of books. This book was different for me because there was a lot of science background in the whole story that made the book a refreshing read. I loved how the Protagonist(Kira) was not only strong but she was also highly intelligent, very determined in what she believed in, and most importantly she wasn't whinny or annoying like most YA characters. The plot was strong and interesting to read about. RM (an airborne virus), Humans cannot reproduce, and the only CURE is in the hands of the enemy--The Partials, who were machine soldiers built to win the Isolation war along side humans in which the Partials then turned on the humans. I enjoyed the challenge of reading about the experiments and the medic world Kira lived in. I must say that the book had some boring parts that had me thinking...When is this going to pick up? But towards the end of the book the action just got better by each page and you can't stop turning. The end of the book was AWESOME but I felt like the end of the book was just getting to the juicy part, I was a little devastated on which characters they chopped off in the end of the book but it makes the story even greater. The ending was enough for me to say ""COME ON NEST BOOK!"" lol, there's a lot of questions that are in need to be answered and I can't wait to find out what happens!'Partials' was a good read and I think readers will like this series because it can only get better!"
4,"Wow, so I just finished Finding it by Cora Carmack and I must say, I totally dug this book! I've read the other 2 books in the series and kinda thought I was getting more of the same but boy was I right and pleasantly wrong. Yep it's a CR/NA book, so you figure it's the same old, boy meets girl, boy falls for girl, boy looses girl, boy wins her back stuff....all with cute, sexy, young people.....total bubblegum for the brain. And yes, this is up that same alley but with a wonderful twist. So let me give you a synopsis before I tell you what's what. 
 So our heroine is Kelsey Summers. She's a total modern day spoiled, pampered, rich American girl. She has it all except parents whom truly love her. She's always been treated more as property then like a daughter. She acts and does all the things her powerful parents could ask for in a daughter in the social eye. They parade her out like a special doll, then put her away when the spotlight is gone. As she's gotten older, she realizes that there has to be more to life. She doesn't like being a shallow, self-centered person and wants to change. She's not sure how to do that but decides to ""find herself"" by going on the ultimate European vacation. As she treks around the country ""finding herself"", she finds herself falling into the same habits she did in the States and spirals into a deeper depression of self loathing. One night, while partying it up, she hears laughter. When she looks up, she sees a gorgeous military style guy laughing his butt off. She tries to ignore him but then realizes, he's laughing at her! 
 Guess what all?? I'm totally gonna stop the synopsis there......*evil cackle*. Ok I'll give you a little more. The laughing guy is the Hero, Jackson Hunt and yes, they end up traveling together acrossed the globe. Now that's all you get!!! 
 Why am I torturing you. Well first, this isn't rocket science, it's an NA novel. Yep they get together and yes there's a HEA but what I don't want you to know is the twist in the story. I actually guessed it right away but that doesn't mean I want you to know about it. Just know, it's a nice twist. 
 What I loved also about the story is the wonderfully vivid pictures that Cora Carmack paints as the two travel the globe. You really get a wonderful sense of the beautiful places the two visit all while they smolder with sexual tension and smoldering heat. I FREAKIN' LOVED THIS BOOK! I also really loved the ending because it's not typical or what you expect to happen. Basically the book takes the reader on a journey of self discovery while taking you around the globe to some breathtaking places and then wraps you up in a HEA. 
 What more do you want??"
3,"3.5 stars 
 I really enjoyed the beginning when Park and Eleanor got to know each other, and towards the end there was a bit where I found it hard to put down, but the middle was too much teenage love troubles and insecurities for my liking."
2,"Welp, here's me going back in time for this series after recently having read book four in the Made in Jersey series. Aaaand here's me being disappointed and pretty glad I read this out of order as I may never have committed to actually getting to book four (alright, that's probably a lie). 
 One good thing about being back in Hook, New Jersey? No one found it unusual if you looked miserable. Hell, the town's unofficial motto was, ""no one escapes the Hook.. might as well give up now."" 
 I should've taken that as foreshadowing. 
 After opening up with a very thin excuse that sends out two lovebirds into each other's orbit, it was mostly hit after hit of annoying or frustrating circumstances, liberally doused with sex sex doubt sex sex doubt. Our lady hero finally gets some backbone around the 85% mark and poof it lasts barely half a page before it's obliterated again. For a short book it was very repetitive, too, with Jasmine constantly fixated on the age difference between her and Sarge and what people in the town would think of her. I mean, honestly, it was seven years.. not seventy. 
 CRASHED OUT was an up and down rollercoaster of annoyance and I attribute that to some of the secondary characters, too. The obvious set-up situation for book two just made me roll my eyes forever. And yeah, I'll probably read it. Because I'm a masochist. 
 1.75 ""awkward dirty talk"" stars"
5,"This review and more can be found at The Heart of a Book Blogger. 
 I don't know what I was expecting from this, but it was nothing what I had in mind. It was a great little thriller with an unreliable narrator that kept me on the edge of my seat until the final reveal at the end."
5,I cannot believe I waited so long to read this book. I thought it was just fantastic! I cannot wait to dive into book 2!
4,"3.5 stars. 
 This is a tough one. I'm not terribly fond of uncertainty in books, but the very nature of this story requires it. Without giving anything away, this is a book about choices--and how those choices shape you and your life. Some choices seem inevitable, but there always is more than one, depending on what you're willing to give up. 
 Pretty dark, with a fair amount of violence. but very thought-provoking. Not an easy read, but an interesting one."
4,"loved Fiona and the dogs, loved Simon.... great dialogue too. maybe a longer review to come?? I gotta lotta reading on my plate, especially with the release of Hit List today :) 
 edit: 
 I like that Fiona wasn't typical ""beautiful"" and I liked the internal conflict Simon kept having... all in all an enjoyable book. I thought I'd give a longer review lol I shoulda done it right after I finished it but Hit List came out same day...lol I know. excuses 
 If you like dogs, funny light hearted dialogue, crime pathology, you'll love this book :)"
3,"Lots of action to move the overall plot along, but I didn't love Trix. She fell flat for me, coming across as a wimpy Mary Sue even though she was supposedly reincarnated as this strong independent woman. And thus the *ahem* action with Finn wasn't as great as I'd expected. So it was a good thing the authors made the sector war plotline interesting because I found that kept me engaged much more than Trix & Finn. There's still a lot of Telling Not Showing in these novels, particularly in the heads of the MCs as they try to talk themselves into being worthy of one another's love, or whatever the main angst point is for the couple. I will say that the ladies that compromise the duo known as Kit Rocha can write a hella hot poly scene."
4,"Like his previous book, Devil in the White City, this book focused on two simultaneous aspects of history. The development of the Marconi wireless and the life of a murderer. While this book was interesting in its facts, I do have to say that it sometimes tried too hard to recreate the story of Devil in another time and place. It was interesting and I did learn a lot from this book, but some parts were too technical and others just didn't hold my interest. Good, but Devil was better."
0,"dropped: 07 may 2013 
 Essentially this book says that there are good and bad times to use your rational brain to make decisions and that there are times when the best decisions you can make are those you will make by relying on your emotions. 
 If the problem has few variables then reason can cope with that and won't be overloaded. If the problem is sufficiently novel - that is, you are in a situation in which you have never been before, you need to avoid relying on your emotions and you need to try to think. 
 This book is not trying to tell you that there are times when you should not think at all - it is telling you that you should always think about the decisions you are making and how you are making those decisions, but to also understand that we are human and we ALL tend to rationalise our behaviour. 
 The more open you are to the possibility you may be wrong the more likely you are to be right. The more prepared you are to listen to others, the less likely you are to stuff up. The more consciously people set up ways in which their views will be challenged the more likely they are not to be fooled by their own bullshit.

5,"Out of all the books in the Pure trilogy, this one was my favorite. I felt that the characters had the most voice here, and the plot wasn't as messy."
3,"This book was very light on events. And who was a quilty party was apparent from the beginning. Well I just hope that the series won't stuck in ""not interesting space"" for long and the next book will be better."
3,"It's paint by numbers romance/murder mystery and it ends, like all her other books, way too fast. Whoosh!"
4,"Such a cool book! Full review later. 
 Thanks Khanh, for the rec. :)"
5,"Another great installment, this one even better than the last since we get to see Samuel's struggle. 
 (As a side note, the covers remain terrible. Especially since they're inaccurate --- there's even a line in the book that makes it clear that our heroine has only one tattoo on her stomach, and yet the book cover continues to cover her skin in tattoos.)"
5,"Mistborn is truly an exceptional series. I don't think I've been that impressed by a series of reveals since Goblet of Fire, which is one of my favourite books of all time. I think The Hero of Ages just might just make it up there. 
 I love the way each book in the series is its own story, but if you read the whole, you are rewarded with so many awesome payoffs. It's hard to explain without spoiling, but this book is essentially about Hemalurgy, the third and final metal art that ties EVERYTHING together. I spent the first two books wondering how Inquisitors were made. Now I know not only that, but so many amazing things that have been happening and have happened just make ridiciously good sense. 
 How many times can I say ridiculous in a review? But all the characters in this book, Vin, Elend, Sazed, Spook, TenSoon, all go through ridiculously good personal story lines and transformations. I laughed, I wept, I wanted more. And I'm so glad I have other Sanderson books to look forward to. 
 I think you need to read this trilogy. You need to read it right now."
4,"This book had way more fantasy aspects than I believed it would and I loved every minute of reading it. The pictures of the children from the island really creeped me out. When I was reading the notes by the author, I realized that the pictures were real ones that he found. I am sure that all the tricks in the pictures were just that . . . tricks. But that doesn't stop them from being creepy. I was so engrossed in Jacob's story. The synopsis indicates that the children could be alive. I was thinking ghosts or a haunting of some kind. I won't give away any spoilers, but the way Jacob was able to communicate with them was quite a surprise. I need to read the next one in the series!"
5,"Whoooaaaaaa. Now, I loved the first, but this one was on a whole other level. It was set in a different city and I was cruising along, interested in the events and mystery, when all of a sudden shit went DOWN. I was not expecting the more sinister turn this one would take. It was really cool and extremely well done. 
 The romance is also pretty great: always in the background, but never too mushy to take away from the main action. 
 I can't wait for the next one (although I'm worried about the hint of a stupid love triangle)! Great series, such fun and entertaining reads. Sprinkled with a dash of romance, too. Definitely becoming one of my favourite series."
2,"** spoiler alert ** 
 I initially loved this series, but when I got to this book I found myself severely bored with everything going on. I love Janie and Cabe, but most of the novel I had no clue what was going on and I didn't understand why things happened and the background to why they happened. 
 Janie learning about her father was a wonderful plot twist, but she barely interacts with him or anything involving his life. It felt as if he was just thrown in for a plot twist and not used to the full potential. 
 There was no action, adventure or romance in this novel that made me feel like I should continue reading the book. Overall, it felt like a cheap final book in the series. I had high hopes for the book finale, and I was sadly let down. 
 I did love the first two books in the series and I hope Lisa continues to write books as good as the first two. This book was a let down for me. 
 I especially did not understand Janie getting handed an envelope near the end. I have so many questions about this book that were left unanswered, and without another book in the series, it's very disappointing."
4,"Like every other Morganville Vampire Series this one starts off right where the last leaves off. But, unlike the other books in the series this one actually does have some back-story [probably because on book number six a lot has gone on]. Just like all the other books from this series there was non-stop action! In the first 100 pages there was already an attempted murder, car chase and more! I love every character in this series! Myrnin is quickly becoming one of my favorite vampires of all time!!! And am I the only on who thinks Monica Morrell is basically Mona Vanderwall?! 
 There was only one thing that I just couldn't get over with this book and that was Ada!(view spoiler)[ A vampire computer?! I can handle the computer with the human essence but the fact that it needs blood to work... nope. Also the fact that Ada runs the whole town reminds me of this..... (hide spoiler)]"
4,"The author was promoting this book for free in exchange for reviews. I am a little slow since I've had it for a long while but didn't want to read it til I was back in my romance kick. ;) 
 I quite enjoyed this story. I'm not usually a huge fan of werewolf/vamp books and yet it seems that's all I've been reading lately. 
 This one was a nice change of pace, with most of the focus on the characters healing and helping each other deal with the trauma's in their lives. Along with the romance and some nicely done suspenseful, actiony stuff, it made for a nice, mostly fast paced story. 
 I really like that the author spent some time on that aspect of the story and not just dropped them and us at the happily ever after. Although some of the parts of the book that I liked for being different and dealing with the PSTD, is also where it got a bit bogged down. You can tell the author knows her stuff and that's great, I love a well researched book but it needed just a little bit of dialing down to keep the story moving. 
 So yes, it was a good read! The leads were great, I love how they started their own pack. The villain was suitably villainy and I enjoyed him and especially enjoyed the supporting cast. I'm really wanting to check out the next book which I understand involves DJ. 
 Also this edition cover is way nicer than the one I have. The one shown here to me, is way more intriguing and I'd be more likely to pick it up if I was shelf shopping."
5,"** spoiler alert ** 
 WOW! I bought this book for my Kindle for a long haul flight after reading some excellent reviews. Im glad I did! 
 Seth and Kaden have been friends for ever. When Kaden finds out he has terminal cancer he discloses to Seth that he is a Dom for his wife Leah. He asks Seth to train to become a Dom to take over Leahs care when he dies as, he believes, that she will come to harm if he doesn't. Yes its a bit of a strange premise for a book but my god it works. 
 The first part of the book is Seth pretty much in shock that Kaden is dying and trying to get his head round his request whilst not really wanting to do it. This part had quite a bit of humour as Seth felt his way around the BDSM world tentitively. Leahs past is mentioned and we find out just how emotionally scarred she is and how Kaden saved her by becoming her Dom. 
 The second part of the book is Seths training. This part was bittersweet and had me in tears a lot of the time. Seth realises he loves Leah and Leah confesses that she has always loved Seth. After getting over the whole ""Why do you want me to Fuck your wife"" stuff and actually doing this whole thing as a menage the story is really quite fantastic. Of course Kaden is getting weaker and trying to do stuff he wants to do before he dies. I think the Christmas bits were the most heart wrenching as it was all about Kadens last christmas etc. I loved the relationship between Kaden and Seth. It was the best bit about this entire book. 
 The last part was after Kadens death and I cried from start to finish. On a plane. Not good! You find out how right Kaden was about Leah as she literally falls apart. Kaden has left all these instructions because he knows them both so well he knows exactly what they are going to be going through. The funeral was heartbreaking as was the wedding between Seth and Leah. I think the most touching part of the whole books was when Seth gets his hands on Kadens diaries. Throughout the book I couldnt get my head around the fact that, although Kaden didnt want to do anything sexual with Seth, he actively wanted to share his wife with him. The diaries clear this up. 
 All Ill say is read this book. I can honestly say no other book has made me feel the things I felt for these characters."
4,"Interesting idea, wish it was written as an adult book, so they could go deeper into the world, characters and story line."
3,"Interesting premise, some relateable moments, but it just didn't live up to my expectation of it, which tends to be how all of Jennifer E. Smith's books are for me. I also wasn't a fan of the main romance in this book. I LOVED the family dynamics in this book though. 
 I did listen to the audiobook, and while the narrator did a pretty good job, her male voices were awful and all sounded the same, so my enjoyment of the story may have been influenced by that. 
 Overall, I think this is a great premise and I don't have anything against it but it came off a bit bland for me."
4,"Charming, lovely, uncomplicated - the perfect read for a lazy summer's afternoon (even if I read it in the dead of winter)."
4,This is the second in what is supposed to be a trilogy (I think) and for a middle book it is very well done. Often the middle book will sag a little because it is neither the set-up nor the denouement (think The Two Towers). But enough changed in this one or progressed to make it well worthwhile.
4,"** I ranked it down to 4 stars because I was still too hyped to think clearly when I was writing this review 
 ======================================= 
 Holy shiitake mushrooms. 
 I just finished reading this and I still feel giddy. 
 I don't usually appreciate books in this genre this MUCH to rank it 5 stars, but this was just.. different because of four reasons: 
 1. St. Clair is hot. 
 2. Anna did not annoy the hell out of me (Well, she did sometimes but..) 
 4. Their friends were very likeable and nice. 
 3. St. Clair is hot. (Wait, I just said that right?)"
5,"This is where it all began, where we were introduced to Harry Potter, Rowling's magical world, a series of exciting adventures and the excellent characters and environments she has given to English literature. It set the standard for contemporary fantasy. Rowling make full use of classic literary and mythological references, freeing herself from the confines of the merely topical, while giving it all a daring sense of newness. This series will live forever.

3,"As children we're all told that there are no such thing as ghosts. However, when a former hitman for the IRA starts seeing the victims of his murders and seeking revenge for them, it doesn't much matter whether they're real or not because if he decides that someone is responsible for their demise, that person will get a chance to investigate the after-life first hand in the very near future. 
 Gerry Fegan was once a feared and respected killer for the Irish cause, but while serving a long stretch in prison, he started seeing twelve ghosts of people that he killed at the command of others. After getting out of jail, Fegan turns into a hard drinking loner who avoids his old IRA pals. With peace at hand and his old bosses now part of the new government, there isn't much demand for the services he used to provide any so they're content to pay him off and let him drink himself into oblivion. 
 When the ghosts start indicating that they want Fegan to kill off the people who had ordered their deaths, Fegan obeys in an attempt to finally get some peace. However, in the politically delicate climate, the murders of powerful former IRA leaders kicks off a new wave of violence and could derail the peace process. 
 I enjoyed this as a dark story about the consequences of murder and how some men use causes to further their own agendas. While some of the internal government stuff went over my head, I could usually figure out what the major players were scheming about. 
 My only complaint was that I found the story of Fegan turning into an instant protector for a young mother and her daughter who has gotten on the bad side of the old IRA leadership as being too quick and easy a way to make Fegan the 'good' guy in this story. I would have been more intrigued if it would have just stuck with him being a broken and damaged guy taking a twisted kind of revenge on behalf of people that he killed himself."
3,"Interesting read. Kristen's struggle with her identity is one that the reader instantly cares about and can relate to. Intersex is something that most people don't know about, but everyone understands how difficult it can be to define themselves and to struggle with how others define them. Reading about Kristin's struggle will definitely help the reader think about gender in new ways, and that's a good thing. But this isn't just an issue book. This is a book about a compelling protagonist trying to find her way in the world."

 Captivating and mesmerizing, this was one dark thriller. By all means, I surely enjoyed reading this amazing book! It was rather a trek out of my comfort zone, being adult fiction with crime. But I love to take risks, being a fantastic bookworm I am! I have to admit, I slipped into a freakin' reading slump about 3/4 into the book. But after some amazing Hobbit marthoning, I was back on my feet. Actually more like back on my butt with a book and some chocolates, heh heh:) 
 For Full Review: Fanatsies of Fangirl Book Blog~ Book Review: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo 
 IMPORTANT NOTE: 
 Book covers really dark topics that are difficult to take in at times and I don't recommend this book to everyone. It is after all, adult fiction. I'm not sure on how to rate on age appropriateness- but I think it matters more on how mature you are. But still, proceed with caution if you're, say 16 or younger. I can't stress that enough, because damn I was a bit taken back with certain content. 
 So I repeat, best if you don't read until ready for mature adult content in this fiction novel.

5,"When I first read the synopsis I knew I had to read this book. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down because how curious I was to figure out what was going on in this book. Angela intrigued me by the way she wanted death but couldn't achieve it no matter how hard she tried. From there on I was hooked to figure out why. 
 I thought all the characters were described so well throughout this book. It was easy for me to imagine them and this made keeping track of the characters easier for me. There was at least 10 characters you have to keep track of so it really did help. 
 Through out the whole book your trying to figure out if Angela or Stephanie is the Archon aka The Ruin. I found this made me want to read more, as well, not knowing if our main character was Raziel reborn. If she had to power to fight the devil, Lucifel. 
 I really enjoyed the demon concept in this world it was more than I expected. Like I said before all the descriptive writing in this book just made it such a good read. 
 ""There is not much difference between angels and demons.Except that the demons have stopped pretending to be perfect."" 
 -- Sabrina Benulis 
 The angels in this book were deadly and just as threatening as the demons were. Even though they might have looked peaceful you find out otherwise. 
 The ending of this book made me want to continue the journey of Angela, which means its good ending for the next book. Which luckily comes out this year 2014, hopefully. 
 I'm not very big into reading Angel and Demon books, this being my first one, but I gotta say I loved it. Now I want to start reading them more thanks to this book."
4,"I quite enjoyed The Winner's Curse. I loved the Greco-Roman influence. It tied into the story beautifully! The overall world was fantastic. I have no complaints about the world in this story. The atmosphere was beautiful and the world building was done well. Everything made sense! A+ for world building! 
 The writing was very beautiful. It flowed very well and I loved that. I will say, despite the beautiful writing, this story is really slow. The plot is kind of boring too because the writing went into a lot of depth. I kept finding myself skimming a few paragraphs because nothing was happening. Well, a lot happened but it felt like nothing was happening. You know what I mean? 
 I liked the characters. There were nice enough but I think I needed more of them. Kestrel and Arin were the only ones with depth. speaking of Kestrel, can we take a moment to appreciate how cool she is? At first I thought she was really annoying. Kestrel was one of those ""I'm so different and smarter than you"" kind of girls. We are told she is an excellent strategist and very intelligent. It's never really shown though until the last half. All that is shown is that she was driven by hormones. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it kind of is when she became an idiot because of it. Kestrel threw away all sense and reason because she thought Arin was hot and different. She never really had a relatable friend but that doesn't excuse how reckless she became. I would have thought she would see into Arin's plans. Then the last half of the story comes rolling in. The part that is foreshadowed through the first half. Does Kestrel mope and cry when she realizes she's been betrayed? Nope. She gets down to business to defeat the Herrani. (sorry couldn't resist :)) She starts planning her next move. Although I don't agree with all of her actions I did love how she realized her mistakes and corrected herself. She sticks to her guns and remains loyal to a fault. She doesn't take crap from anybody. She isn't perfect though and she realizes her mistakes relatively quickly. If you cross her though, even when she is the one at fault, you better watch out. However, she does remain loyal even if she has been betrayed. She will figure out a way to make sure everyone she loves is safe I loved her character (as you can probably tell with me rambling about her). I love it when I can completely change my mind about a character too. (when I turn out to love them I mean) I do think her character still needs some work but I really like her. 
 The plot was really cool too. I loved how the Roman influence was brought into the story. It made for some nice battles :). The slavery aspect was done really well too. I do wish it was weaved in more though. I am against slavery of any kind, like any decent human being, but I have never really seen it outside of history. It's nice that slavery is being brought to a young audience in a more exciting than history class sort of way but I feel like it should have been brought to light more. Arin wasn't really treated like a slave nor did he act like one. There was a missing opportunity there. 
 Overall, I really liked The Winner's Curse. It had a nice world and story but was slow tended to be boring. I really recommend this to history lovers especially."
3,"I liked it, and it was an interesting take on the 12 Dancing Princesses. But while it was a very enjoyable read, there was something missing. There was mention of magic, but not a lot of magic, and it pretty much focused on Azalea. I know all 12 sisters couldn't be focused on, and it would be focused on Azalea, as the oldest princess. I honestly couldn't keep up with all 12 princesses. Both the beginning and the ending were pretty interesting, but the middle was boring, and it was the same thing every chapter. The princesses hate their father, they don't want to be in mourning and so they go through the portal to dance every night, and very little happens. They did whine (a lot) about how they couldn't dance, and they all seemed to be rather self-absorbed. 
 Most of the sisters seemed to blend together, but I found the Keeper to be interesting for most of the book. Until he got all cartoon-ish. Come to think of it, I'm not quite sure why I like the book, but the whole idea of the Entwine dance was interesting. There wasn't a lot of description about the palace or what the girls wore, which was somewhat nice. But I think it would have added something to the book as well, just to have an idea of what the author thought the palace looked like. It wasn't a particularly interesting re-telling of the 12 Dancing Princesses. There were a couple romances thrown in, and it felt like they were there...just to be there. 
 Overall, it gets a 3 out of 5. It was enjoyable, and I did like it, but there was just something missing. It's apparently supposed to be a fantasy, but the whole fantasy element didn't seem to be there. It was a good effort, and I did like the idea, plus the cover is really pretty. But not something I'd read again anytime soon."
2,"I was really disappointed with this book. My biggest problem with it, is that nothing is really happening. At first, I thought the style was supposed to be reminiscent of a person's life sort of ""flashing before their eyes,"" which would've been interesting, but it wasn't. It is a book about the textile market of the 19th century and if you are interested in that (or would like to know a bit more about funerary practices - although not really, it was mostly about the market than the funerary practices of the Victorians, which would've made this novel far more interesting) well then you should read it. 
 The Thirteenth Tale is one of my favorite novels, so I really couldn't wait to get my hands on this book, but it was a huge disappointment. Plus, I get really mad when this happens: the book was described as a ""ghost story"" and there are no ghosts! not even hauntings! Not even madness!--you could argue for this one, but really I read The Thirteenth Tale, that was haunting and Gothic, this is not. Huge disappointment."
3,"3.5 stars 
 I'm not rounding up because the writing left something to be desired. The book was cute, and enjoyable as a summer read. I appreciated learning more Italian. I don't think teens or people in general talk like the characters do, it was too simplistic and stilted. There is a difference between international students, and ones who travel, versus teens that don't and I appreciated that representation. I just wish certain writing elements were stronger and fleshed out. I sort of felt like I was reading an outline at certain parts. 
 Overall plot was cute and interesting. The characters were sweet, though Lina's tendency to shut down and assume things instead of just finding out by talking or reading got annoying. But that's teenagers and something needs to stall the plot progression I guess..? Again, a little weak in the writing. 
 Perfectly acceptable as a summer read. Despite death and paternity subject matter, it was a pretty light read. Though perhaps a little too light considering those subjects, there was room for more depth."
5,"Delightful romance,left me smiling! 
 Maggie has always loved Braden MacAlister, but he has never seen as anything other than his friends little sister, until she stages a strike of all theclan women against the men and suddenly he is seeing her in a different light!"
4,"Safety Level: Safe with exceptions. While there are no explicit scenes with other women or other men, it is obvious that both main characters have been with other people even when they were attracted to each other. 
 Cliffhanger: No 
 Ending: HEA 
 How sexy can a fictional hero get? I read this book after I read After We Fall, but I fell in love with that book, so I really had to go back and read this. Man Candy is the best way to describe this book's hero. Seriously, the way Ms. Harlow paints him is this hot, delectable man that any woman would want to touch... or like... or own. And he's a great guy too! 
 Story-wise, this book was pretty simple. If you think about it, this is your usual best-friend's-sister trope where the guy has had feelings for the girl for years but did not do anything about it because of a code he lived by but then after several years, they meet again and BAM! the feelings just can't be stopped anymore. But you want to know what's special about this book that sets it apart from the rest of the other books with this kind of plot? It's the author. 
 Like always, Ms. Harlow doesn't fail to entertain her readers. She writes with that equal amount of LOL moments and sexy times and a little conflict or drama to push the characters from their comfort zone. Her formula always works, and that's probably why lots of readers love her, including myself."
3,"I had some issues with this book, but overall it was good and some of the twists really surprised me!'"
4,"I received a free digital copy from the author/publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest feedback. 
 The Good Goodbye is a dramatic and suspenseful novel about two girls and a family full of secrets. Arden and Rory Falcone are cousins and best friends, born only four months apart. They have been together their whole lives but when a fire breaks out in their dorm room leaving the girls in critical condition and another student dead, Arden and Rory's parents end up with a lot of questions and wonder if they ever even knew their daughters at all. 
 This ended up being way better than I thought it would be. I wasn't expecting anything bad but I definitely got a lot more sucked in than I originally thought I would be. The family dynamic in this book alone is something that gripped me and figuring out how everyone was related and the history between everyone, the secrets, the romances. Arden and Rory are both complex characters who are hiding things and everything comes to light really slowly in a great way over the novel and through flashbacks. The girls were definitely not as perfect as they originally appeared to be, Rory not as pristine and Arden not quite as innocent and I really enjoyed reading along to figure out why they were the way they were. 
 I really love how little tidbits were given here and there among the story that really made me o ""whatttt!"" in shock and just really made it hard to put down the book. There's definitely a delightful amount of mystery in the book and I seriously suspected everyone from Arden, Rory, Hunter, DD, Gabrielle. No-one was safe! 
 The timeline could get confusing at times as there was no point where the reader was told we were heading into a flashback, we kind of had to figure it out but other than that the reading was easy, fast and gripping. I really enjoyed the ride."
4,"I finished the Jane True series a couple of years ago and then the Sookie Stackhouse series a year ago and have been looking for something that I liked as much as Jane True. Sookie Stackhouse was close, but not quite *there*. 
 So this series came up a couple of times in my recommendations, so I figured I'd try it. I really enjoyed it. I can't say that I loved it, but I really liked it. I laughed out loud a couple of times and decided I like this book enough to read the next one. 
 If you enjoy urban fantasies with a feisty main character (and who doesn't??!!), you should give this a try."
5,"Just re-read this for the first time, and it's still one of my favorites. This book is geek-heaven: cryptography, world war II, code-breaking, nazi gold, and modern day internet beginnings all tied together in one masterful story. 
 It also was largely lost on me, and I suspect many of my generation, that the second world war was won - or at least greatly accelerated - in great part due to the fact that we had cracked the German and Japanese codes. Learning more about the efforts of Bletchley Park, and Dr Alan Turing and huffduff and cribs, etc was fascinating. 
 I think the funniest part of the book is the page where Stephenson actually graphs out how productive Waterhouse is when he has recently had sex (very productive) and when he hasn't (not very productive). 
 The code-breaking and cryptography is not stuff I know a ton about, as modern day programmers largely don't have to worry about that stuff, but it's a good reminder to think about, as we don't have it on our brains nearly enough. Avi & Randy's paranoia and tendency to encrypt everything from their hard drives to their emails may be overkill, on the other hand, it also may be wise. I remember getting email from people who used public/private keys to encrypt their email before, but not in the last 5 years. Maybe we should request that Gmail Labs add that! 
 If there was a theme to this book, it's that cryptography is everything. It defined the second world war, and it also defines the modern internet. Information is king - not large caches of gold."
3,"3.5/5 stars. There were things that I really loved in this book and others that didn't sit well with me. I'm sad to see this series end, mainly because I'm so attached to Meghan, Ash, Puck, and Grimalkin. Definitely Grimalkin. I'm sad that I won't be traipsing back into the NeverNever to save the fae world but I am glad to see Ethan's point of view end. 
 Review to come. I'll explain my reasoning behind everything."
4,"This book is divided in three parts. 
 Part 1 is a story of two teenage boys, Josiah and Mateo, discovering their sexuality and first true feelings for each other. The tenderness and beauty of their relationship is shown in contrast to the harsh reality of being two underage orphans living in a foster home, with no control over their lives. 
 Part 2 - my favourite part - is breathtaking. We are introduced to Tristan here, and even though in part 1, I swore to myself, I'll have no place for anyone else in my heart, I quickly became besotted by this aloof and broken, secretive young man. Suddenly, I stopped caring about Mateo, and wanted more than anything, to see Tristan and Josiah together. 
 So when I reached Part 3, where all the characters came together (pun intended), I was confused and torn and slightly disappointed. To me, this was an overkill. I did enjoy all the broken pieces getting their HEA, but it didn't feel realistic enough. In my ideal version, Josiah would've stayed with Tristan, and Mateo should've gotten his own book. 
 Still, I get the feeling, I'll be reading the sequel soon :)"
4,"Toni Morrison has written a lush, earthy story, set in a segregated area of Ohio, about the black experience between 1919-1965. Nel, who has a very traditional childhood, becomes the best friend of Sula who lives in an unstructured environment. When they become adults, Nel got married, had children, and stayed in her hometown. Sula went away to college, and had affairs with many men, following the path of her sensual mother. Sula returned to her hometown after ten years, became the source of gossip because of her loose ways, and deeply hurt Nel. This is a story about female friendship, and about what constitutes good and evil. 
 The book is also a portrait of a small, vital black community facing hardship. The black men in the town have to deal with discrimination in hiring with even the government construction jobs closed off to them. I enjoyed Toni Morrison's complex characters and gorgeous writing."
4,"Enjoyable. Good characters and good interactions, a believable plot, some wisecracking. 
 Veronica is perhaps too much a grown-up Flavia de Luce, especially in her relationship with Sir Hugo. Stoker's a good partner for her anyway, and I don't mind reading about a grown-up Flavia. 
 This one really leans on the royal connections, and Raybourn's going to have to get out from under that if this series is going to continue. And Mornaday might have to be a little less unpredictable. But that should be easy enough."
2,"Even after about a year ago, I still remember why I put this book down. 
 I was bored and it swore.

5,The only good thing about the whole trilogy was Zuzana & Mik's relationship. I need more.
3,"Love the series! It was very interesting getting to know Butch and Vishous and they're unique relationship. Unfortunately the more I get to know Marissa, the more I dislike her. I don't think her and Butch are a good fit and I find her very annoying. I see Butch with someone that is not so proper and old fashioned. At any rate, I really got into the story line. The whole yin and yang of Butch and V is perfect!"

 I had conflicting emotions when I finished the book. But when I thought about it, I definitely liked the book. 
 We are introduced to Ethan Moonsong in Greed as Cricket's boyfriend. In Fury, Ethan is miserable and heartbroken. He spends his waking moments with his bottles and is waiting for a chance to take his revenge on Spencer Blackwell. 
 One fine (or not) day, he meets Finley Dyer in the bar where she persuades him to eat something. Finley is also introduced in Greed, where her crush on Ethan is hinted. 
 Finley had been studying with Ethan and Cricket in high school. They hadn't been very close, thanks to Cricket's interference. However, Finley and Ethan used to have small conversations which Ethan mentions later as highly consequential. 
 Finley starts showing up in the bar henceforth to save Ethan from drinking himself into oblivion. They start bantering and become close friends. 
 We get to know more about Ethan's life in this book. Ethan's mother had died and that had affected his life greatly. He had built his life around Cricket in order to reconstruct his shattered life which is why he is devastated after Cricket leaves him. 
 Finley has also gone through a lot of torment in life. When she was young, her drunk mother used to bring home men who would sleep with Finley. One day, her mother is taken away from her and she has been independent since then. 
 Once, Spencer and Cricket show up in the bar and Ethan goes to the extent of almost killing them. He doesn't, thanks to Finley who makes him see the wrong in his actions. 
 Finley is to leave for Vietnam as she has volunteered to be a part of a Charity which she refuses to reveal to Ethan. However, Ethan finds out and becomes aware of the risk she is putting herself in and also travels to Vietnam to protect her. Finley has volunteered for Slanaigh (meaning safeguard in Irish), an operation to save young girls who are victims of sex slavery. 
 Ethan starts helping the team and somehow, helping the young girls get away equals to saving Finley from her past according to him. 
 He decides to take matters into his hands and starts hunting down the people behind this and is nearly killed in the process. 
 I have a lot to say about some parts of the book: 
 1) In the initial parts when Ethan goes to Vietnam, the story was very similar to Vain. In fact, it was just like Vain with Ethan in Sophie's role and Finley in Ian's role. But this changed sometime later when the action started. 
 2) Ethan's character is not consistent. Cricket's declaration of love to Spencer is the base for Ethan's fury. He starts off as a furious ex-boyfriend, becomes a control freak, then an amazing person (which lasts for a short while), and ends up as... I don't know what he ends up as. An ex-killer?? 
 He ends up with Finley. There. That's a safe one. 
 3) This was what I didn't like. The parts when Ethan goes around killing the people responsible for slavery and MIRACULOUSLY escapes death were highly unrealistic. 
 This part was exactly like those superhero movies where the hero falls in love with a girl, and is inspired to do good for the world to deserve her love, hence abandoning her in the process as duty calls or because ""it's too dangerous for her"". 
 Finley takes a backseat and Ethan goes around saving the children and she finally reappears to pray for Ethan's life. 
 I mean, I loved Finley and I didn't like that fact that no justice was done to her character. She was turned into those desperate heroines who needed the Hero's assistance to live, even though she started off as a bold, funny and independent character. 
 4) The book has certain parts of the books from Finley's POV, hence deviating from the writing style in Vain and Greed. 
 5) 
 _____________________ 
 However I really enjoyed the book. Apart from those parts, it's a really amazing book. 
 I would recommend reading Greed before reading this, as both Finley and Ethan are introduced in it. 
 This book was definitely better than Greed, which was a disappointing read after Vain, which I absolutely loved. 
 I admire Fisher Amelie and appreciate the amount of effort she would have put in to write the Vietnam part. It was perfection. 
 Check out my review of Vain and Greed.

2,2 stars for the complete inability of our female character to be nice to literally any other woman in the book that wasn't her best friend.

 Charlotte ""Charley"" Davidson is the Grim Reaper. Not a cloaked skeleton with a scythe figure you might be thinking of but more of a portal to help stranded spirits complete their ""unfinished business"" and cross through her to the other side. Yes, I did say through her. In First Grave on the Right, Darynda Jones takes readers through a week in the life of Charley while she helps catch a murderer (with the help of some spirits), and tries to save the life of her ""dream guy."" 
 This laugh-out-loud story will entertain readers with the crazy scenerios Charley gets herself into. It seems trouble always follows this grim reaper. Good thing Charley has a light-hearted brush-it-off attitude. That might be the only thing that keeps her going--and maybe some coffee. 
 Jones not only creates a loveable main character, but creates a winning team of supporting characters. From Charley's funny and understanding best friend/receptionist to her demanding and supportive Uncle/boss, Jones creates entertaining characters that readers will quickly relate to. 
 Jones' First Grave on the Right is a mix of the Stephanie Plum series 
 by Janet Evanovich with some paranormal aspects and a bit of romance. Both are quick and easy reads that have readers eager for the next book in the series."

 --Below information added approximately a year after original reading-- 
 I made the mistake of reading this shortly after finishing the Forever War by Joe Haldeman. To keep them distinct, I should have read them far apart from one another. The Forever War, after all, preceded Old Man's War by over 30 years. Generations of new writers had come, published, and moved science fiction along in that time. The two works do bear surface similarities: both are space opera with heavy emphasis on the military with time split between Earth and the heavens. Haldeman's book, however, was much more somber, grittier, and sociological. Scalzi's, by contrast, was bright, humorous, and technologically inventive. 
 Old Man's War falls into that category, which I commonly note and enjoy, of idea books. It puts forth something ingenious and exciting, something truly novel, and then it lets it loose to see where it goes. Scalzi rewarded the reader with a good setup and sense of mystery. Once the main idea was revealed, however, the rest of the book was somewhat dull in comparison. Scalzi keeps the reader interested with adrenaline and some witty dialogue, but by the halfway point, you have to realize that the best is already behind you. 
 A good idea goes a long way with me. I can certainly see how someone with different tastes and standards would judge this much more critically."
2,"This book is a romance lightly disguised as a dystopia. What makes this so disappointing is the fact that the premise is so full of potential and so chilling, particularly given the current state of affairs in the U.S. What I expected from this book and what I go were two completely different things. More complete review to come."
0,"DNF. I'm on page 50 of 432 of You: A perverted romance? Yeah, that's what I'm getting. The writing is excellent and compelling, but if this doesn't progress out of a one-sided stalker's wet dream...I'm out."
4,"Gossip, secrets, nosy neighbours, ruffians, evidence of a crime scene - all of these are mixed together and revealed in reverse chronology to create a detective story even a 10 year old could resolve, if it had been told the other way around. 
 Mrs. Creasy is missing and all the misfits of The Avenue cannot seem to put their prejudices and quirky behaviours aside long enough to piece together the truth. Although everyone seems to know everyone else's histories and secrets, the truth is too wrapped up in poor decisions that incriminate each character. It is a fun, little mystery except that the gossip and speculation have very real effects on some of the neighbours. I am quite glad that I do not live on The Avenue! 
 Delightful but hard-hitting, if you really think on it."
4,"Better than I expected. I can't stand/won't ever get the Twilight Series, so the fact that this book had so many comparisons to the books threw me off for quite a while. But I decided to check it out anyway and surprise, I actually really liked it. Yes...there is this whole BAD BOY meets GOOD GIRL aspect which is kind of overdone. Some parts are a bit over-the-top (Marcia and Nora insulting each other? Please)...and, to be honest, I didn't think the relationship between Patch and Nora was believable. Yes, I get he's sexy. And she's not so bad either. As the two mains, I do like them a lot (and Vee too). But COME ON...it takes the bad guy to inform Nora the way Patch really feels about her? No way. Come on Patch, you're not human but you deserved to at least have some big moving scene about your feelings and all that instead of coming through a third party. 
 Anyhoo, minor complaints. No characters annoyed me outright, the dialogue and relationships (for the most part) were realistic, and the pages kept turning. Will be snapping up Crescendo next week (so as long as Patch and Nora don't turn into some teenage boring couple)."
4,"Best book in the series. Writing was tighter, plot flowed better. Trent is still an a-hole. She's still using Ivy, but we see some sort of special connection there, which I'm sure will lead to her being able to save Ivy's soul. Mostly because Harrison's foreshadowing reminds me of a sledgehammer to my frontal lobe. All the good stuff is there. 
 From what I've read of the rest of the rest of the series, it goes downhill from here."
4,"Kvothe Kingkiller: Awesome? Or the most awesome? 
 That appears to be the important question in Rothfuss's first book, which came to me highly recommended. The book makes no secret of being a paean to the overall badassery of its hero, either; the blurb is largely a list of Kvothe's many accomplishments, accompanied with a cocksure ""you may have heard of me."" If you think this all sounds like a tome of author wish-fulfillment that is centered on an annoyingly unbelievable protagonist... well, you wouldn't be too far off the mark. But Rothfuss achieves the highly improbable, here. This is an extremely readable fantasy epic, with writing so genuinely good that I was forced to forgive its more egregious faults, no matter how much I may not have wanted to. 
 The book is actually a story within a story, and opens with a somber introduction to the owner of a lonely village inn. We soon learn that the unassuming innkeeper is living in hiding for some reason, and is the Kvothe we have apparently heard so much about. Strange tidings are afoot around the inn, however; demon-like creatures are attacking the travelers on the nearby roads, and Kvothe seems to be the only person around (along with his strange, otherworldly ""employee"" at the inn) who understands what they are and how to fight them off. Eventually, the famous Chronicler (who, appropriately enough, makes his living by chronicling things) travels to the inn after nearly being killed by the creatures on the roads, drawn to the area by rumors that the legendary Kvothe Kingkiller was hiding somewhere nearby. After some careful prodding, Kvothe agrees to tell his story, provided that he can tell it his way, immediately, without interruption. Thus, the book continues with his own story told in his own words, beginning with his childhood years as a traveling performer, and the circumstances that saw him admitted to the prestigious University on his way to becoming the youngest and most powerful Arcanist in centuries. 
 The story has a purposeful, palpable epic feel to it. This is a story about Kvothe, told by Kvothe. There are a number of interludes that pull back to the ""present day,"" including a particularly tense and action-packed chapter near the end, but they don't yet connect directly to the main narrative. The Name of the Wind is mostly about Kvothe's past, and the beginning steps of the journey that apparently leads to infamous adventures and deeds of great renown. The story is heavy with foreshadowing, some of which is fulfilled and some of which leads unmistakably to events in future books. I have seen multiple references to ""Harry Potter for adults"" in discussions about this book, and I'm inclined to agree: boy who is old for his age and seemingly good at anything he tries goes through some hard knocks, and then gets accepted to a school of magic and mystery, where he's immediately the star of the show and suddenly vulnerable to dangers he hadn't even considered. 
 Considering how up front Rothfuss is about what sort of story we can expect, the book is executed masterfully. Rothfuss can really turn a phrase. The writing is crisp and descriptive, and Kvothe's tale flows like it really is being told by a minstrel, exaggerated at all the right parts and rife with beats and asides calculated for maximum dramatic effect. This is a pretty massive novel, but I couldn't put it down. Moreover, you can see how carefully a lot of the story's main themes are crafted. The rampant Mary Sue-ishness of Kvothe and the plot convention of the skeptical Chronicler taking down his story intertwine to create a parable about the ephemeral nature of history, and how the line between fact and myth is often blurred in order to create a legend. 
 But, come on, you can't write a book like this without taking some flak. If you tell me your hero is the most radical cool guy EVER, then I'm naturally going to be skeptical. Make no mistake, Kvothe is really supposed to be that good at everything he does. He had a photographic memory as a child. Was a master musician by the onset of puberty. An unrivaled actor. So good at learning rhetoric and chemistry that he was a graduate-level scientist at 12 years old. Naturally, he's the most gifted wizard that anybody has ever seen. Fit and strong enough to physically face down a pack of ravenous demons, and still be chipper enough to crack a complicated text cipher a few hours later, after reading a single encoded paragraph. Oh, and let's not forget how every remotely attractive woman in the vicinity is immediately primed for some naked time with him, despite the fact that he's a teenager. PERHAPS YOU'VE HEARD OF HIM! 
 This somewhat ill-advised assuredness actually bleeds through into Rothfuss's writing, which I think is where the faint whiffs of wish-fulfillment are coming from. Rothfuss is a fantastic writer, and excels at both telling the story and penning attractive, flowing prose. He's so good, in fact, that he loses focus in a few places. He sometimes gets so wrapped up in a clever turn of phrase that he misplaces a pronoun or two. And he's often guilty of letting his adept grasp on vocabulary and grammar get in the way, which is kind of a greenhorn mistake. For example, while I'll admit that ""a sea of susurrus murmurings"" is an aesthetically beautiful phrase, it's not only irritatingly redundant, but probably the most pretentious goddamned thing I've ever read in a fantasy novel. So, yeah. Between the grandiose descriptions of Kvothe and the bombastic tack that Rothfuss takes with the narrative, it can be occasionally difficult to take this whole thing seriously. 
 Here's the amazing part, though: The Name of the Wind skirts the line between ridiculous and awesome so nicely that all of these issues can be apologized for through the story itself. Kvothe's superhuman attributes all have a verifiable origin in his characterization, dubious though they may be, and they are nicely balanced by the multiple scenes in which his cocky naivete lands him in hot water. The self-aggrandizing feel of the story fits perfectly within the framework of a scribe attempting to chronicle the true story of someone whose past is as much legend as actual history. Even the fact that this book doesn't really have an ending (because it doesn't; this planned trilogy began as one very long manuscript, and that fact becomes apparent when the book dumps you off into nowhere after 700 or so pages) is softened a little by the nice way in which Rothfuss bookends the story with a parallel prologue and epilogue, and bolsters it with interludes that hint at a greater story arc. For all that I wanted to cast aspersions on the weak elements of this book, I just couldn't bring myself to do it. This is a great fantasy work, almost despite itself. 
 I heartily recommend this to any fantasy lover. It's pompous in just the right way, and tells a fun and resonating story. Rothfuss deserves the credit he's getting as a talented contemporary fantasy author. However, I'm recommending this with a caveat: Rothfuss is building quite a bit of momentum with this eminently readable first book, and he's already used up much of his credit in terms of how totally super badical tubular awesome I'm supposed to believe Kvothe is. I'm waiting to see where this story goes, mostly eagerly but with a healthy dose of skepticism. I liked this book enough to drop thirty bones on a hardcover edition of the second book, but from what I've already heard about the second book, I'm more than a little wary."
5,"I liked this so much more than I thought I was going to. I had to read this for a literature class, so the reading experience was a little different than if I would have just been reading this for fun. I loved Ender's character so much. He was put through so many difficult things, and even though he struggled with comparing himself to his psychopathic brother, he never really lost who he was. I think he was a great protagonist, and though I never had any desire to befire, I really want to watch the movie that was based on this."
5,Never have I been so emotionally invested in a story since forever. Beautiful Chaos is well written just as the two before and not only that but you'll be crying at the end. Looking forward to reading Redemption ASAP.
4,"I shudder to think that there are people out there who actually live like this. So sad, so evil. I have zero tolerance for MCs. I may read about them from time to time, but abhor them in reality. To me, the are just plain old bullies, evil lawless bullies. Rant over. I enjoyed the story, can't help pitying Holden though, hope he gets his HEA too - no one should love another person so much and not be with them."
4,"I liked this very much! This novel revisits my favorite Stephenson setting (a future similar to the one in Snow Crash) and twists it up with his clear penchant for historical-ish fiction and archaic social mores (as demonstrated in the Baroque Cycle). Also, it's under 500 pages, which I think should probably be the upper limit for a Stephenson book - Anathem notwithstanding, he often goes on for much too long. 400-ish pages means this novel is chock full of great details without sacrificing the pace of the plot. 
 All of that said, I personally forbid Stephenson from writing ANY MORE NOVELS that feature cryptology and/or alchemy. Enough already!"
4,"4.5 stars. Really enjoyed this book, but definitely didn't get as much from it as I could have because I waited so long in between reading the House of Hades and this one."
4,"I didn't like this quite as much as STILL MISSING because the main character here wasn't brave and resourceful, but kind of whinge-y and timid. However, it was still a good thriller!"
4,"So funny. Literally laugh out loud funny. The kind of funny where my husband pats me on the head and calls me a nerd because I'm giggling unselfconsciously at a book. 
 I was surprised how sad parts of this were. I think it just goes to show how well the author can convey emotion in these really terrible cartoons (it took me literally half the book to realize that yellow triangle is a ponytail). But I appreciated how Brosh represented depression. And how she explained how much someone can love one dog who is so irredeemably terrible, and another who is as smart as a cube of cheese. 
 Fantastic."
5,"To say I love this series would be the understatement of a century... But Goblet of Fire is by far my most favourite of the seven books... the details are wonderfully laid out and the Triwizard tournament will forever be my favorite wizarding event (leaving out the fact of Cedric's death, that is).... :)"
0,*is automatically wary of any book about Indian history* so call me a cynic.
5,"There are very few readers that will pick up a book where the main characters commit adultery. Unfortunately for them, they're missing out on a pretty heartbreaking yet beautiful story. 
 Usually, Karina Halle's are wild and chaotic with twists and turns. LIE however is not one of her typical novels. It contains no crazy plot, but instead is a quite realistic view on cheating. Rather than seeing the usual story play out, we are looking at it through the eyes of ""the other woman"". This is in no way a glorified story about cheating. Vera very much doubts herself and her actions, as does Mateo, the adulterer. 
 I won't be giving a summarized version of the plot as per usual, because again this novel has a basic plot that would give the entire story away. I recommend just going in head first without reading any reviews or at the very least just a couple. If you're okay with the cheating, that is. 
 This is a story that you need to start blindly and just give it a chance. Read and feel the character's emotions and keep an open mind. 
 While Vera and Mateo may not have gone about it the right way, the heart wants what the heart wants. It is not a fling, but it is a real and deep romance. 
 I would highly encourage everyone to at least give these two characters a chance. I believe Karina Halle gave them a painful experience to endure with important life lessons. Despite having one another and true love, life is still not easy for them."
3,"It took me ages to finish this book. Five freaking months. I would find myself opening the book and after a while I'd put it down and god knows when I'll pick it up again. I found it slow and un-engaging, it might be because of the third person POV or maybe because I just didn't like Jason, the main character and the leader of the series. Unlike Percy Jackson, Jason is boring and he doesn't have a sense of humor. I know he's suffering from memory loss and he has more important stuff to think about other than being funny and interesting, but his existence was so pale and bland to me that I'd only remember he was there when the chapter's title is his name. And speaking of chapter titles, the lack of witty titles made me upset. One thing I loved about the previous series, Percy Jackson and the Olympians, was that all the books always had pun-y chapter titles which made me look forward to every chapter.. and that might be one of the reasons why I found it kind of hard to move forward in reading The Lost Hero. 
 But anyway, as much as I disliked Jason.. I still liked the book as a whole. It was a little dull at first but the action scenes and the denouement made it up for me, the mystery about Percy's disappearance was answered and the revelations were intriguing enough to make me read the next book. Also, Leo has to be my favorite character! For me, he's much more powerful and leader-like than Jason. Jason only had that reputation because of being the son of Jupiter and because he was ""mysterious"" and is Hera's champion and all that shit, but it was mainly because of Leo that I managed to continue reading the book 'til the end. I really liked his personality, he's cool and charming and funny, and I love how he just fidgets with tools and then just suddenly create something useful out of nowhere. He even fixed the ""cursed"" bronze dragon and named it Festus, they both were so pleasing and their interactions were delightful. 
 I am looking forward to more of Leo and the new Festus (the flying ship version), and character development for Jason. 
 ""Leo, who apparently thought he could defeat the armies of darkness with breath mints."""
3,"I am in a phase of reading trashy romance/adventure and picked this paperback up at the library. I couldn't put it down for the first half. There is a fair bit of suspension of belief in the time travel/romance plotlines, but no more, really, than usual for a romance/adventure book. I am completely untroubled by the time travel/so she gets a new man plot - it is no more unrealistic than so many romance novels. The historical novel aspect was really fun. Then the book started to drag some as various random subplots were added and it got a little repetitive. Still good. 
 But the last 20% were really disturbing and did not fit with the rollicking time travel adventure/romance of the rest of the book. I am not sure how to hide spoilers on Goodreads, and this book is really popular and I don't want to spoil it for anyone. It is hard to suggest that someone read 80% of the book, and skim the rest, but that is what I did. So, only 3 stars."
1,Tries to sell that prostitution is just fine and sexy. The author failed to establish neutral boundaries and thus manages to support rape culture.
3,I was excited to finish the trilogy but ended up disliking this last instalment the most. Just too many eye-rolling moments and lazy plotting for me. Now I am glad I feel asleep and didn't buy this one during prime day.
2,"Hmm, idk, I just didn't think this was very good? But somehow I was interested enough to keep reading. 
 Everyone is so DENSE in this series. Everything is so obvious from miles away, it's kind of tedious waiting for the characters to catch up. Toby, you are supposed to be a PI! Really! I was willing to cut you some slack in the first book b/c REASONS, but this was just ridiculous. (Especially on that whole Alex/Terrie thing. Who didn't realize what was going on there from almost the start?) 
 There's also the fact that of all the prerequisite dudes-I'm-supposed-to-drool-over, only Tybalt doesn't bore me to tears. Can ... can we just stop wasting time on the other ones?"
1,Review in Swedish at Boktycke.
5,ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!
3,"My Sister's Keeper was the last Jodi Picoult book that I read, and that's a high standard to live up to. 
 This one, didn't really, but that didn't mean I didn't like it. I did. And I liked the premise, which is the whole reason I picked it up in the first place after not picking one of her books up for so long. 
 But every time I read My Sister's Keeper I'm in tears by the end. And I think I've read that book three times. I kind of wanted that same heart wrenching effect and that didn't really happen. I was left with kind of a more... meh, ok, that's nice. It all makes sense now, I get why all these things happened and I can APPRECIATE the book a lot more, but I wasn't in tears. 
 That being said, I read the book in two days flat. The story was INTERESTING. It was compelling and made me want to read more and more. So, there's something to be said for that. Even if it wasn't want I was expecting, it was still enjoyable."
4,"Pretty solid writing and introduction to a series. Foreshadowing and seeds of plots to come were littered throughout and it was great - I love an author with a plan. It was a pretty simple story without huge action scenes and the ending confrontation was a little tame for urban fantasy, but it fit the story and style of writing and it benefited from that greatly. 
 I didn't find myself attached to the main character or some of the more prominent side characters, but I can see myself becoming attached after I read ore of the series. I liked them and all, but I'm just not attached yet. I did feel for some of the smaller side characters though. There were a couple deaths that were just sad. Not because I loved those characters, hell one was only there for about five minutes, but because of the mark their deaths left on the living. It was believable and for that their deaths were sad. 
 Definitely look forward to reading the next book when I can."
4,"You can see this and more reviews at Angel Reads 
 I received a free copy of The Girl from Everywhere by ... from Hot Key Books in exchange for an honest review, this has in no way influenced my thoughts and feelings about the book. 
 I heard quite a bit of conflicting thoughts about this one, some people didn't like it, and some loved it. It's one of those books that you just need to pick up and make the decision yourself. In saying all this, I truly did love The Girl from Everywhere and I am so excited to read more. 
 The Girl from Everywhere follows protagonist Nix Song as along her father and his crew time travel around the world. They are all aboard The Temptation, a pirate ship that is filled with treasures from all around the world, from all different times. 
 First, I adored the world of this book. Time travelling on a ship, through maps; yes please. I was just so intrigued and that alone kept me wanting to know more. I thought that the world building was well written and didn't give everything away, but just enough that we had an idea of how the world worked. 
 The thing is that you can only travel through a map once and Nix's father only wants to go to one place; Honolulu 1868. Where Nix's mother is alive and she doesn't exist. But no one knows what would happen if they go. 
 I enjoy Nix as a protagonist in The Girl from Everywhere. She was easy to get along with and I sometimes laughed at her naivety, because it got her into situations that were entertaining. I loved her characterisation and seeing her grow throughout the novel. She is quite strong at the start, but she learns how to stand up for herself and the people that she loves. 
 I loved the dynamic of all the characters and how they interacted with each other. The banter was perfect and I could read scenes with just the characters talking and bouncing off each other. 
 Though I loved a lot of the character's I wasn't the biggest fan of Nix's father, but I didn't hate him. He has his reasons for what he wanted to do and he was too blinded by love, grief and even guilt to think any other way. However, we also see him grow through the novel. We see him realise things that he didn't know or what to believe before and that was nice to see. 
 Another problem that I had with Nix's father is that he is referred as different names throughout the novel by Nix herself. Sometimes she calls him father and other times by his name and this confused me a little. 
 The romance wasn't my favourite thing in The Girl from Everywhere. I am not a massive fan of love triangles, like I hate them most of the time. But it was different in The Girl from Everywhere. It was a love triangle of sorts -ish. It is hard to explain. I didn't hate it, but then again, I didn't love it. 
 Kash was my favourite character after Nix. He's just so loveable and I want to give him a big hug. He was full of sass and banter, and made light of situations, but was also good to have a talk with. The friendship that he has with Nix was truly nice to see and yes, you do end up shipping them eventually, but I loved that we got to see a friendship first. 
 One of my favourite things about The Girl from Everywhere is that it's set in Hawaii. I love that place to bits and I am so intrigued and interested in its history, that this was just perfect to read. 
 The Girl from Everywhere is also hella diverse. I LOVED it. It was so great to see such a diverse cast that were intriguing, fun to read about and didn't slip into stereotypes. 
 There were some parts that did drag and I may have gotten a little bored, but overall it was an entertaining and fun read. 
 Overall The Girl from Everywhere is about friendship, family and love, about what would you do for those that mean so much to you, and that sometimes you have to give up one thing for another."
4,"I quite enjoy reading Jaron as a character. He is a brat but he's also brave, cunning, loyal and protective of his people, which makes him just the type of character I love. This was a good continuation from The False Prince. It explores more of the world where the story is set and the political difficulties. In the end the book is Jaron's quest, which I very much liked. I can't wait for the third instalment."
5,"I knew I would love this book when I saw the first page. It was like a parody of Wikipedia. I have a weakness for documents in books. If there is a document in a book I'm reading then the chance that I will love it goes up by 40%. 
 And I did love this book. I really liked Cath. I liked her relationships with Wren, Reagan and Levi. I liked how multi-layered the characters were. I did start to skim over the snippets from the Simon Snow books. I was more interested in Cath's story. Her relationship with her family. I thought the way she felt about her mother was really well done. 
 I have to say this book lived up to it's hype. It makes me want to read John Green's books. I've been meaning to and I'm trying to break out of this hive mind I have. This has nothing to do with Fangirl but yeah sometimes you have to make up your own mind."
4,"The story is told through Laurel's various letters to various famous dead peeps, which originally was an assignment for class but she continues throughout the year. The way the dead person, whether it was Kurt Cobain or Amelia Earhart or whomever, was brought in to reflect whatever part of Laurel's story was being told was really interesting. It becomes clear that writing these letters is her way to cope with not only her sister May's death, but her own issues. 
 ::Slight tangent ahead:: The fact that she never hands any of them in for a grade kills me. It's like seriously just write a something and hand that shit in! Get that grade! ::End tangent:: 
 ""And maybe what growing up really means is knowing that you don't have to be just a character, going whichever way the story says. It's knowing you could be the author instead."" 
 I appreciated Laurel as a character. She was complex even though I think she was a bit immature and simple towards the beginning. You really get to see how all the things that have happened in her past shaped her into the person she is in the present. Also the way her past is revealed through out the span of the letters was done very well. 
 Dellaira was great with not only Laurel's development but that of her best friends Hannah and Natalie. Their relationship with Hannah as well as with each other came off very sincere. I think it was easy for me to relate to their little crew as they were shown as kind of different and outsiders (shocker that me being a book nerd didn't always fit in). 
 ""When we are in love, we are both completely in danger and completely saved."" 
 And of course there is the boyfriend, Sky. Her first love. He is the new guy, mysterious and of course a hottie (do the kids these day still say that? did they ever?). Their relationship was sweet but also a upsetting (you have to read it to get those juicy details). Again, I think their relationship rang true and I liked the progression it took. 
 ""I think a lot of people want to be someone, but we are scared that if we try, we won't be as good as everyone imagines we could be."" 
 As the letters go on Laurel opens up more and more about her relationship with her mom and dad, her sister's death, and what she has gone through in the past but never really dealt with. The letters serve as her therapist on some level in my opinion. Probably because no on sees them so there is no nervousness or hesitation to share. No judgement to face. 
 ""Truth is beautiful, no matter what the truth is. Even if it's scary or bad. It is beauty simply because it's true. And truth is bright. Truth makes you more you."" 
 While the book deals with some majorly heavy topics, including death, it still has very normal high school issues - first love, friendships, fitting in and figuring out who you are - as well. I found the book to start a little slow but still engaging. Once I was past the halfway mark it really started to pickup. Of course by the end I was a mess. Overall I thought it was a great read and glad I picked it up ( especially since it was because I loved the beautiful cover!!)."
5,I am emotionally wrecked by this book. So here's an old-school crying emoji because that's all I'm capable of producing at the moment. ;_;
4,"Better than the Mark of Athena, but still terribly long. It didn't feel slow necessarily, but it felt as if I were trying to run through water. 
 House of Hades made me love all these characters even more (at the end of Mark of Athena, I detested Jason, Piper, Hazel, and Frank). And Nico! Oh, Nico, you're now my favorite character. Even though he's not one of the seven, he seems just as important and I'm loving all this new character development he's getting."
4,"3.5/5 
 Dusk is the second book in the Dire Wolves Trilogy. Dusk was a very quick read, at about 222 pages, it flowed by in a single afternoon of reading. It also helped that I knew all the players since the stage was set in the first book. Dusk picks up right where Dire ended off, with Gage being turned into a Dire to save his life. While I was reading the first book, I found myself more torn between Hunter and Gage than I thought I would have been. And in Dusk, it was even more confusing. I felt myself getting mad at Mary Ann that she wasn't giving Hunter more of a chance. Give Hunter a chance in the next book Mary Ann! 
 The Dire Wolves Chronicles is a very cool trilogy because it is set in the world of the Petrons and the Society from two of Alyssa's other series. And in this book we even get to see Levi and Allie. That was nice, and it looks like we are going to be even more involved with the society in the next book, so I am looking forward to that. Even though it might not be on the best of terms, but it will certainly be exciting and action packed. 
 Like I said earlier, I want Mary Ann to give Hunter a chance. It is not that I disliked Gage. I don't. At all. But Hunter just seems so patient and kind with Mary Ann. I really believe that he cares for her, and I just feel so bad that she keeps shunning him over and over again. And because of that, this book was very light on the romance. But I have a feeling that the next one will not be. Now who the guy is, I have no idea. But there will be romance. Fans of Alyssa Rose Ivy's paranromal series will want to add the Dire Wolves Chronicles to their TBR list. 
 3.5"
5,"I read this series for the first time when I was very young and have read it many times since. Its power and beauty are indescribable to me, and to this day I still feel the same thrills when I read the name of Aslan, or the same happy glow when I think of Lucy sitting with Mr. Tumnus in his little house, or the same thrills up and down my spine when Polly and Cedric are trapped by his mad uncle. 
 As I grew older I began to see the references in the books to the Christian faith, or at least references that I perceived. This has just made these novels more profound and special to me - C.S. Lewis is a very special author."
3,"very nice read. The kid really has a bad-ass mother. 
 The kid was a bit vague though. Could not really figure out how old he was and he seemed to act like different ages"
3,"Even though I still really liked this book it was a definite step down from book #1. 
 Gaia lost so much of her badassery that I wanted to reach into the book, shake her and scream SNAP OUT OF IT! 
 I understand why she finally stood up and fought but I had to wonder why none of the other previous injustices inspired her to change things. 
 I'm hoping that now that she's found her way back to strong Gaia she'll keep her around in the third book. 
 Oh and for the love of god NO MORE LOVE SQUARES!"
3,"Okay, so let's see what this book has in store for it's readers: 
 Unique Sci-fi Plot? Check. 
 Badass, complex characters? Check. 
 Fast paced, and action filled pages? Check. 
 Intriguing blurb? Check. 
 And about a hundred more, everyone. 
 All of that, in just four hundred and thiry two pages. 
 How can one just not love it? 
 Well, It dragged on a little bit, yes. 
 But the concept, the teamwork, the way the characters are? 
 They were all written brilliantly. 
 T'was a good book, and one I'd love to see the rest of the series to. 
 I cannot wait to read the next book. 
 [3.5 Stars, yet bordering on four]"
5,"I'm so glad I read this during a blackout so no one could see my tears, okay? 
 Loved a lot of things about this, especially the fact that most of the cast was PoC? Mateo is Puerto Rican (#ownvoices!) Rufus is Cuban-American, there's Colombian, and Black rep... I love this book with all my heart. 
 Also I teared up a little bit when they ""visited"" El Yunque National Rainforest... 
 I'll write a better review soon, I hope."
4,"REVIEWED FOR PRISM BOOK ALLIANCE 
 Rhys Ford is an auto buy for me for a number of reasons the main one being I just love her writing. Murder and Mayhem is like some of her previous books where we have an alpha male who doesn't automatically get what he wants and a bit of murder and mystery to keep us guessing. 
 Dante Montoya has a little bit of everything for me. He is dark and brooding, intent on getting his man, even if initially he wanted to see him behind bars but he also has a soft and quite vulnerable side especially when he was around his uncle. 
 Rook Stevens owns a pop memorabilia shop in Potter's Field but his life hasn't always been so mundane. He has left his previous life as a cat burglar behind but it seems his past has come back to haunt him in more ways than one. His night isn't going so well when he finds a former associate dead in his shop but it takes a turn for the worse when he is arrested by Dante for murder, of all the cops to arrest him this one has a grudge. 
 This is a real enemy to lover's story with a massive boost of lust that initially kicks things off. The romance runs alongside a sometime confusing mystery but it is one that needs to be solved quickly before Rook finds himself dead as the body count seems to mount daily. There are a lot of characters to keep track of and I had to go back a couple of times to make sure things were clear in my head. 
 With the grudge that Dante held I thought he would be the one that found their relationship most difficult and I was completely wrong. Rook has a lot of demons he needs to put to bed going all the way back to his childhood. His mother may have been useless but I did find myself with a soft spot for his temperamental grandfather. 
 As this is book 1 in a new series I really hope we get to see more of Dante and Rook. First books are like teasers and tasters, they have a lot to live up to and they need to pull the reader in. Murder and Mayhem certainly pulled me in and I look forward to book 2."

 *Touching Spirit Bear is about a teen with a major anger issue. The things he did because of his anger causes him to be banished to an island in Alaska to heal instead of going to jail. In this book, it talked about many things about life and things that Cole did to let go of his anger. This is a great book because it teaches many life lessons as the characters in the book expresses their thoughts about life. It also teaches the way of forgiving and what can change from doing so. -Stanley T., 7th grade 16-17

4,"What it's about: This is the retelling of Blue Beard's tale and begins with Sophie accepting a mysterious invitation to join her godfather after her own father dies. She's used to leading a comfortable life, and this widower provides for her ... until whispers and threads of secrets begin appearing, such as tales of his former wives, all who had hair as red as Sophie's. 
 Why you should read it: Even if you've never read Blue Beard's tale (hint: He kills his wives), you'll enjoy Strands of Bronze and Gold. Sophie is a very likable character, and readers will soon find themselves caught up in the intrigue and mystery right along with her. Bernard made gave me the heebie jeebies ... I wanted to scream at Sophie to just run away! I'm glad, too, that Sophie was no shy submissive heroine. She's brave, intelligent and looks through the glamour. The Mirk and Midnight Hour is set to release in March 2014 and is about the legend of the Ballad of Tam Lin. The writing is excellent, and the setting is very Gothic and dark. Just my style!

5,"This story was great. I liked the strange way that the Gatherers saw the world: they serve the goddess of dreams, the afterlife, and peace so their chief concern is helping people move into the afterlife of dreams peacefully. Everyone else sees them as being vultures who euthanize the living and harvest their 'dreamblood,' aka lifeforce. My one complaint was that the Gatherers were a little too faithful: I would have liked them to be a little more hesitant in their Gathering, or to ponder more on whether what they were doing was ethical or not. It brought me out of the story a little, even though I do think that overall it helped strengthen the Gatherer characters. Will read the next book soon."
3,"I'm a sucker for Jane Austin re-makes. Especially Pride and Prejudice. It's my favorite Austin novel, as well as my favorite movie of all times! So it is always hard to pass up a modernized version. I recently found a mime on Pinterest that said ""All women want a Mr. Darcy. Unfortunately all men have no idea who that is."" My guess is that this is about 99% truth. (I tested it, asked my husband, ""Do you know who Mr. Darcy is?"" The answer was no. Which is surprising, since I watch the movie at least once a quarter. Or at least every time I pick up a P&P remake. It took everything in me not to put down this book and put in the movie this time around. 
 And there you have my review. Sort of. The modernization was good enough. It centered around the dog show arena and of course the rich and...not-so-rich. The book included plenty of Darcy, and Elizabeth moments, many of which avid fans will recoginize either from the book or by the movie. In fact, many of the key phrases from the book were utilized here. Elizabeth, true to the original, was a master of misunderstanding Darcy, but in this version it was almost to a fault. In fact, I think that both the pride and the prejudice fell to Elizabeth most strongly in this rendition. Mr. Darcy was constantly putting his foot in his mouth, and more than once I felt that Elizabeth's responses and disdain were uncalled for. I got a bit frusterated with her refusal to hear Donovan Darcy out, and if I were him, I most certainly would have given up on trying after so long. Mr. Darcy was charming and compassionate and understanding. He was apparently quite handsome, although for some reason I had a hard time picturing this particular Darcy in my head. 
 The dog shows, while the common ground between Elizabeth and Darcy in this book, were really a rather small part of this novel. I did enjoy the the bits that were there, but I think when I requested the book part of me had actually hoped on a few funny scenes and dog antics, but other than a scene of a dog peeing on beautiful carpet there really wasn't any thing like that. I guess they were show dogs, and were trained to absolute perfection. 
 While I guess I didn't LOVE, love this book, I still always enjoy an Elizabeth and Darcy rendition, in its (at this point) many varieties. I love the different interpretations of the brooding, overly-handsome Darcy, and Elizabeth's fumbling of the relationship. If you're an Austin fan, and enjoy modernizations, I see now reason why you wouldn't enjoy this novel."
5,"It doesn't matter how many times I read this book, I still love it. Great characters, striking imagery, and a whole crap load of social commentary."
2,"2.5 stars. I think this book will appeal to people who are super intensely involved in fandoms! But the story definitely would've worked better if the main character were in middle school or early high school instead of college. She just read as incredibly immature to the point where I wanted to stop reading halfway through I was so annoyed. 
 Liv's favorite character dies at the end of a movie, so she whines for weeks about it. Her mom tells her maybe it's time to let the fandom go and... get a life? Liv bombed her SATs a few years ago and didn't sleep much in high school because she was so involved in the fandom. Like she has no other interests and her obsession actually gets in the way of her hygiene and basic LIFE. It's unhealthy and weird. I'm a pretty intense fan of a lot of things and totally love nerd culture, but Liv is definitely not a relatable character. I did not enjoy reading through her POV. 
 The main story is about how Liv starts a movement in the fandom to influence the writers to bring back the character who died. She casts her friend she has a crush on in some of her videos, but he has a girlfriend... 
 Aside from Liv, the story was kind of fun at times. Her best friend Xander was interesting with his steampunk cosplay vibe going on, but I really wasn't feeling the romance. But I did appreciate that he was bisexual and the author did a great job with that aspect! I also liked the general quotes at the top of each chapter that referenced Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Doctor Who, and other nerdy things. And Comic Con is fun, so I always like stories that show that culture. 
 I mainly appreciated that the writing was good and had realistic texting dialogue (like it didn't sound like an adult trying to be a kid). I never got particularly into the story, but it was still fine. Nothing was necessarily bad -- I just didn't connect with the main character at all. So this was more of a case of it's not you... it's just me."
1,"Pure porn. No story beyond girl want job and has participates in a gang bang in place of an interview. This is by far the most sex-crazed woman ever! The summary is the story. The only story aspect is her mother moving in and that the front assistant does not like her (at least until he screws her). The is no romance. Just a crap-load of insane lust. No character depth, no personality with anyone. This isn't even hot. It is weird. There is no flow to anyone's behavior. Seriously I wonder if the water was drugged b the world's strongest aphrodisiac. IF you want to read a sex scene just for the sex check it out. If you want any chance of story or even sexy hotness, there is lots of other options that are better qualified."
3,"It was ok! Not fantastic, not as good as Dresden Files, I'll keep at it. It seems like the next book is gonna be the typical ""kid goes to school and get bullied"" book, purely from guessing."
5,"Great book. I hope this is not the end of the series. 
 So many weird things happen. And one of the weirdest is who killed Harry, why, and how he failed. :P Mab and the genius loci thing...working together. :) 
 BTW...I finished this on the day of release. :D"
5,"Ok let's get that negative out of the way ; 
 I kept hearing that this book has a ""sex in the city"" feel, I didn't see it at all. 
 The story started out slow, and took me a few attempts to get started. 
 I think there was far too much about other character's, like Birdie and Kiki and that took away from the main characters, Warner and Taddy. It would be nice to have more about those two. 
 The love between Warner and Taddy was rushed, the author could have cut a few Birdie/kiki parts out for some more ""alone time"" for the pair to blossom . 
 Ok now that's out of the way, to the good bits :) YAY! A strong lead woman who stands on her own two feet! 
 Taddy, who was brush off to boarding school at 12years after her father found out he wasn't her biological father. 
 Instead of falling into self pity, she worked her way to the top and at 28 years old is the owner of Brill Inc. 
 Taddy is strong, determine, witty, and stunningly gorgeous. 
 The fiery red head is driven by sex and sexy men and makes no apologies for it. She is proud of who she is and goes after what her heart (or other body parts) wants. 
 Warner, married his first love very young, a cougar, who taught him about respect for a woman and started with him in the business of building hotels until she passed. 
 Warner threw himself into his work and built his empire, becoming a millionaire by 33 years old and attracting the wrong women, such as Rielle, his ex fiance who is nothing more than a lying, manipulating gold digger. 
 He is incredibly attractive, very defined body and a killer mouth on him. 
 The chemistry between these two is very evident from the start, very hot and heavy, until an interruption. 
 It's a shame if took them months to reconnect. 
 You will laugh, scream, climax and pull your hair out with this book, that is a promise , Avery certainly delivered a good read. 
 Women all over the world will be ""buzzing"" over this book ;)

5,"Superb! This is the 3rd Peabody I have listened to. It is excellent! I am determined to find them all in book form, and audio if I can find them, for my collection. 
 This installment manages to incorporate all our favorite characters in the series in a most satisfying way. Peters has thought of everything making The Snake, the crocodile and the Dog another incredibly entertaining tale!"
5,"I actually liked The Prince better than The Selection and The Elite. I thought it was kind of fun to read the story of how America and Maxon met from Maxon's point of view. 
 The writing style is great and it's nice to get to know more about Maxon. A must read for every fan of The Selection :D"
3,"Jodi Picoult always finds very controversial topics for her novels, this time it's about a mother who has to decide if she wants to accept the heart of the murderer of her daughter for her sick second daughter. 
 This in itself was a very interesting and fascinating story. But there is also a large amount of religion, believing, God, and a new messiah thrown into it. Nothing I normally read, but I know that there is a huge audience in the US-market for topics and themes like this. 
 The story is told from four different viewpoints, and I'm still undecided if I like it this way (and the ever changing font style). 
 Altogether definitely worth a read, but not one of my favorites of Picoults books."
5,just as good the third time around :) I love knowing I can always go back to this series for a reread.

 *Please note you should have read book 1 before since this is a continuation of the same story* 
 Fracture is part 2 of Sloane and Zeth's story and man does it start to get good. Zeth and Sloane still are so hot together. Sloane is still embarrassed that she likes the things Zeth is into. She still doesn't freely admit that she likes his dark ways, or that she is the one who chooses to let it happen. Man he is hot hot hot! I loved reading the two of them together. 
 In this chapter Zeth also learns that his employer might not be the man he thought. He doesn't want to believe he is dealing in women, something Zeth is very against. He also has Lacey to look after, who we still don't really know much about. In his need to find some answers he drops Lacey with Sloane and heads off to try and find her sister. 
 Sloane should be fine babysitting Lacey, but when things don't go as planned she has no choice but to run to Zeth. Now I will say this book leaves you with a lot of questions, but you must be patient. I am sure they will be answered in time, but I am just burning to know Zeth's entire back story! Why is he so against kissing? What happened to send him to jail? What is really going on? 
 Also the end...man this book gets to a point where I am just like Sloane!?!? What is wrong with you?!! Did you seriously just do that??? Like I am so worried for her and Zeth and what might happen next! I was yelling at her lots in my head, like I thought you were smarter than this!! Really I just don't want anything bad to happen to either of them! I know you need to find Zeth, that Zeth will keep you safe, but man she is reckless with her own life sometimes which just makes me worry so much. She is strong, but stubborn and I hope she listens to Zeth in the next book. It just puts me on edge the way she is, but I love it at the same time. It gets kind of intense and I must go read the next part now! I must find out what happens next!"

 I have been waiting for Josh and Katie's book, and Shannon Stacey does not disappoint. 
 Josh was left ""holding the bag"" when it came to the family owned Northern Star Lodge when his dad died. His older brothers and sister had all moved away and found the lives they wanted to live and that left Josh running the family lodge. I have felt for Josh from the beginning. He knew he could not leave the lodge like his brothers and sister did, but he sucks it up and carries on until he can no longer hold it in. All Josh ever wanted was a choice. 
 Katie Davis grew up with the Kowalski kids. Her mother Rose was the house keeper of the Northern Star and helped raise the Kowalski kids. Katie has been in love with Josh for as long as she can remember. Only problem is, she is Josh's best friend and he sees her as one of the guys. I absolutely love Katie. She has been a favorite of mine since her first appearance. I love the scene when Josh finally sees Katie as a women. Katie is funny and loyal, and really understands Josh like no one else. Their story from best friends to lovers is so emotional and just one of the best written friends to lovers stories. 
 This was another great read by Shannon Stacey about getting what you wished for, and realizing what you wanted all along was right in front of you the whole time. I laughed and I cried, and as always with the Kowalski books I was left wanting more. I hope Ms. Stacey continues with these great characters. I hope we will get Liz Kowalski's story soon. And, I am really crossing my fingers that we get Haley's story. 
 If you have not read Shannon Stacey, you must. You will not be sorry. 
 Happy Reading!!

 When I saw sign ups go up for this blog tour, I knew I had to jump at the chance to be a part of it. Even though it was put together with less notice than most, I knew I had to make time for this book, because I love Nicole Williams and her writing and her Crash series is a favorite of mine. I also love the sound of this book and it sounded like my kind of read. I really cannot believe it, but I think I liked Lost & Found even more than I liked Crash, and I loved Crash! 
 I think what made me love this more than Crash is that I truly loved our main gal Rowen. Rowen is broken and my heart just breaks for her. She is lost and never lets anyone in and she has good reason to be the way she is. She hides behind her edgy clothing, dyed hair, and eyebrow ring. Even when she is making decisions that make me want to shake her, I can fully understand her reasoning. 
 Then we have Jesse. I LOVED Jesse. He is a fantastic character. He is so sweet and good and kind and not normally the type of character I get crazy over, but I definitely got crazy over Jesse. And boy can he ever wear a pair of jeans. Oh dear Lord. Normally I am all about the bad boy, but there is something to be said about a genuinely good character like Jesse and characters like him are few and far between. Though Jesse has his secrets as well, I just cannot get over how sweet he is. Oh and he is a cowboy... a sexy sexy cowboy. 
 This is one of those books where you sit there waiting for the floor to fall out, but when it does it still hits you right in the feels. I became very much attached to these characters. I smiled, laughed, and cried with them. I loved watching Rowen grow over the course of the book. I have also never hated a mother as much as I hated Rowen's mother. I loved the simplicity of life at the ranch and the way everyone worked together to keep it running. I loved watching Rowen become a part of the world, a world which she initially wanted no part of. 
 This book is a fantastic read and I highly recommend it, especially to those who love The Wild Ones by M. Leighton. It is a great New Adult with all the components one would expect, while still maintaining its own distinct flair. In case you missed it, I adored this book and I just want to make everyone else read it!

 'tried to read' 
 I had been looking of this book for so long and the writeups and editorials were intriguing..... 
 but I just could not get into the story and the name of Phedre was so alien... 
 I was 100 pages or so in and I realised that I was not going to upset if I never found out what happened to her.... 
 could not imagine reading more books in this series.... 
 disappointed....

5,"A sweet little slice of heaven I'd been dying to read Ellie and Adam's book since the first book it was totally worth the wait. The way the story was crafted was unique and gave a smooth flow to the plot and helped me understand the characters so much better. In the first book you keep wondering what was on the other side and it was simply beautiful. 
 Can't wait to pick up the other books!

3,"#booktubeathon2015 challenges 1 & 5 down. 
 Well, Babs seems a mite confused, and the narrative is all over the place. And namedropping tech every which where gets a bit old in a ""look at me, look at me"" kind of a way. And the cast felt a bit diversity check listed. (Am I being a bit harsh? It's late, I'm tired.) The art work _is_ colourful and vibrant, but I think it's fair to say I am not yet a fan."
5,"The word menage doesn't scare me away from a read, but if it does you and you're hesitant about picking this one up because there are three men I beg you to reconsider. Because this isn't a menage book. It's a book with three main characters. There is a difference. 
 Kerry is young and lost. A foster kid who had to leave the only place that felt like home when he turned eighteen and he has been barely surviving. He gets involved with a bully from his past and in a matter of a few hours loses everything he had. 
 Two men, Malcolm and Charlie help him out that morning with basic kindness and a hot shower. There is interest there, but Kerry runs far and fast from it. 
 Malcolm is always in charge. Charlie and Mal have been together half their lives and love each other deeply. But they have some serious issues that come to the surface when Kerry enters their lives. 
 Yes, there are some D/s elements in this book, but it's not really BDSM. It's more. These three men, all from foster families, all a bit broken, all unable to communicate some of the hurt they live with, need something. They know that the others could give it to them, but there is so much in the past and such aching pain. 
 This book is about love being made, renewed, accepted. It's about family, both chosen and given. It's about submitting to self and seeing yourself and those around you as worth healing for. 
 And they do. These intense men heal and love and we get to read their lives. An incredible book that is so much more than meets the eye.

3,"The events in The Hidden is pretty much a vehicle to ask the big ""what makes us human?"" question. The Yeerks have used the Helmacron morph-sensing technology to track the morphing cube. While the Animorphs are on the run from the Yeerks, an African Cape Buffalo is inadvertently given morphing powers and inadvertently acquires Chapman. It follows the Animorphs and appears to be learning as a result of the human intelligence in its DNA. The moral question becomes urgent as the Animorphs realize the buffa-human needs to be destroyed in order to protect their identities as human. Some interesting philosophizing makes up for an otherwise boring plot and ending."
4,"The book version of the ultra-popular blog. Does not include full blog content, but does include some stories not on the blog. Is also physically harder to read than the blog, but still funny and sad as all get-out, and I really appreciated her drawing ability more upon this reading. I think the art is supposed to look ""so bad it's funny,"" but it's really comedically quite good. From her Fresh Air interview: 
 ""Really, a lot of time goes into this crudeness. There's a huge difference between drawing the pupil a slightly different size -- ... a millimeter to either side can make such a gigantic difference in a facial expression, or shaving a tiny bit off the corner of the line of the mouth. So there's really a lot of work that goes into ""perfecting"" this crudeness.""

3,"This is a beautifully written short that blends fairy tales and revolution. However, it stumbles when it splits the narrative into two pieces. While both were important to the plot and message of the piece, the latter half about the protagonist's adult life in the resistance felt too rushed and disconnected from the original story until the ending. The theme of ensuring one doesn't forget one's culture should also have been more stressed throughout the piece. However, Red as Blood and White as Bone was an utter delight to read!"

2,"This collection of short stories encompassed some of my favorite authors. I liked that we got a different look into their series that we normally don't get. For the most part these stories were not from the main characters, but some others, letting us get to know them a little better."
5,"I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley in exchange for my unbiased opinion. 
 The Equals, or magic users, have ruled Britain since they overthrew the monarchy in the 1600s. Non-magical people have to give up 10 years of their lives to work as slaves in one of the slave towns around the country. Luke, 16, is devastated when he learns his parents have decided the entire family - his dad; his mom; his 18-year-old sister, Abi; and his 10-year-old sister, Daisy - are going to serve their slave days now so they can be together. Abi has managed to get the family a placement at Kyneston instead of one off the slave towns; they will be serving the founding family of this magical government, the Jardines. On the morning they are to leave, however, Luke is separated from the family and sent to a slave town. They must start their slave days apart but vow to get Luke to rejoin them as quickly as possible. 
 This book switches views between Luke's, his family, and the Jardines. Vic James has created a fascinating alternate universe. I find it intriguing that some parts of history remained almost unchanged despite the presence of magical people - the Civil War still took place in the United States; computers were still invented, and so on. The end of the book definitely had a few surprises for me and a big cliff-hander; I can't wait to read the next book in the series!"
3,"There were many things in this book that I enjoyed a lot. I laughed out loud quite a few times, I really enjoyed the weirdness of Cameron's journey, and I liked the decriptions of his self in the hospital. 
 The voice of the teenager was mostly done very well. That seesawing between child and young man came across nicely, though occasionally the philosophizing sounded a little too mature. The movement from a rather callow youth to someone who understood and acted upon friendship was very good. 
 While this wasn't a book that I ""couldn't put down"" it did keep me engaged. On top of that, I really enjoyed the ending."
0,"Started off funny and interesting, but I think that if you're just following Biblical rules without internal motivation or faith, it comes off as a pointless exercise.

4,"Rating: 3.5 
 The world-building was fantastic! The characters were a little flat and predictable, but I liked them well enough for the book to be enjoyable. 
 The story is set in a bleak desert world that is the result of some societal collapse. Not much is known about the ancients and what caused this collapse, so of course, curiosity seekers will tread territory heedless of unknown danger. The main character, Khat, is swash buckling rogue type. He has dabbled on the wrong side of the law, but is mostly a good guy. That doesn't mean he can't hold his own in a fight. He is hired for a simple job to be a guide, but finds himself pulled into a game of political intrigue that may have huge implications for the entire world. 
 It is hard not to like a character like Khat. He is plucky and resourceful. Being an outsider means that he can stand on his own, but he does have some staunch allies. It was entertaining to see how he escaped each predicament, even if they were predictable situations in which to find himself. The pacing was a bit inconsistent - the middle of book dragged a bit, but overall it was a fun read."
3,"3.5 
 There were cute and funny moments in the book. Also, the flow wasn't bad and I think it ended nicely (not really anything cliffhanger-like). But the things that irritated me from the beginning didn't get any better throughout the book, and the relationships between characters were too flat for my taste. I did think it was very interesting how dystopian-y the Compound felt and thought that aspect of the story would take precedence and shoot off into a ""bigger picture"" type thing (it didn't really). 
 Maybe I'll elaborate on this later?"

 Nocturnal Predators Reviews 
 This is one of those books that I'm sorry I read. I am a huge fan of Abbi Glines and in my opinion this isn't one of her best books. I didn't agree with the actions taken by the characters and that just made the story drag on and on. I didn't understand the why's behind Marcus's actions because they didn't match up with his presented personality.Let's start with Willow (AKA Low). She's the abandoned girl with an evil home wrecker of a sister who doesn't really care about her at all. She's also used to being pushed aside just for being her and has trust issues with anyone who isn't Cage. She's makes a miraculous exception for Marcus and gets her heart broken again and again. I was starting to get sick of that by chapter 15. She's such a push over when it comes to Marcus and her sister, that it's pitiful. I wouldn't have accepted him back if I were in her shoes. I'd deal and move the beep on.Before this book I thought Marcus was just an immature kid with really nice manners. This novel does show a different side to him, that in the beginning I actually liked. Then came the family problems, which him being rich and somewhat sheltered, really did a number on him and his relationship with Low. Up to that point I understand his reactions, but it stops there. After he repeatedly gets drunk, almost does the nasty with a girl on the dance floor and drops his online courses because of his family problems I think he want too far. Just because he's got problems doesn't mean his life is over. Being the nice, sweet, thoughtful guy that he SEEMS to be, he should just take the high road and deal, not hide behind getting drunk. There are people with worse problems then his family. The most surprising action on his part that goes totally against the character we were presented was that he didn't stop and listen to what Low had to explain. When that happened I just started think he was bipolar or something. 
 Favorite Quotes: 
 ""He's all sweet and possessive. It's adorable and slightly nauseating"". 
 ""What to see if I'm bluffing? Please, by all means, take a wing at me. You start it and I'll finish it"".

2,"Lucinda Price is a new student at a reform school in Georgia. She was sent there due to past events where her boyfriend died under suspicious circumstances in a fire. She carries the guilt, as she cannot explain what happened. She blames the shadows that follow her around everywhere. She meets Daniel, and Luce is immediately drawn to him of reasons she cannot explain. It is like she has seen him before, but where and when? 
 ""Sexy, fascinating, and scary"" is written the cover of this book by P. C. Cast. When reading this novel I did not come across any of these. It is rather sad as I was looking forward to something new. There are too many books circulating out there with vampires and werewolves, and whatever. But this book promised fallen angels, however, I had not expected 'this' kind of fallen angels. But we are picture something different in our heads. 
 I did not see any serious character development, as Luce just could not make up her mind. Daniel keeps leading her on, then suddenly he disappears on her, and she starts stalking him because she is obsessed. 
 Another dislike of mine is that is seems that the book is divided into 2 parts. The first part is the 2/3 of the book where nothing really happens, and no explanation for anything. Then we have the last part, which sadly is only 1/3 of the book, where everything happens and it happens so quickly. Simply too quickly for my liking. Everyone around her knows about her and her past. All the people from the school that is mentioned in the book are a fallen angel or know about it. 
 Maybe it is because this book is the first in the series that I have so many unanswered questions. The story could be good if there were some changes to it."

After all, he started out as an insecure South African to now being heralded as the ""real life Tony Stark."" He has lofty goals that set him apart from your average billionaire (average billionaire - is that even a thing?!), and he has the mind, smarts, and vision that truly makes him unique."

 Sydney is excited to spend the next 4.5 weeks with her childhood best friend, Leela, backpacking through Europe. However, all her planning for this trip didnaEUR(tm)t account for the fact that LeelaaEUR(tm)s ex boyfriend, Matt, would be around with his hot friend, Jackson, in tow. Trying to keep an eye on Jackson while also keeping an eye on her motheraEUR(tm)s mental health back home, Sydney has to figure out for herself how much she can manage looking after people and when she just needs to keep moving. 
 I was so excited for I See London, I See France because of my love for Paris and my trip to London earlier this year. I love the style of doodles on the cover and the premise was interesting but, unfortunately for me, I felt the execution of it lacking. Truly, it was reading alongside Tiff @ Mostly YA Lit that kept both of us going through this story. (You can check out her review here). 
 Where do I begin. The characters are annoying with their sense of entitlement and ignorance as they traveled around the countries, especially Leela, who could possibly be the worst, most self-absorbed BFF ever. Sydney wasnaEUR(tm)t perfect, but sheaEUR(tm)s a saint for having to put up with Leela. For a trip that theyaEUR(tm)ve supposedly planned so much for, they seemed surprised and quite ignorant at a lot of things. The narration felt extremely juvenile, which is fine if the main characters were younger. But Sydney and Leela were supposed to be nineteen and spending their trip drinking, smoking pot and having sex all the while giggling at and not being able to comment on the statue of David. It was a weird juxtaposition that didnaEUR(tm)t work for me. The only characters I found not overly irritating were the other backpackers they met and Kat, SydneyaEUR(tm)s friend working in Paris for the summer (yet never seemed to be at work very much)."
5,"Have I ever told you that I love it when characters undergo growth in a book? I probably did, but I'll say it again just in case. I love it when the main character grows throughout the novel! Which was the case with Rebecca -aka Rebel- in Shelley Coriell's newest book. 
 When I read the summary of the book, it intrigued me because of the Bucket List part, but this book is so much more than Rebel trying to complete a dead girls bucket list. It is about a troubled protagonist struggling to find herself. The Rebel we meet at the beginning of this book is very different to the Rebel we find nearing the end of this book. The bad-mouthed, anti-social, artsy girl pushing away the very people that are trying to help her. They are all a facade, hiding a girl that is lost and just doesn't know how to handle feeling so out of place. Completing Kennedy's bucket list was the push in the right direction she needed. 
 Shelley Coriell perfectly manages to capture what it is to grow up, to find out who you are and staying true who you are. Because above all Rebel stays true to herself. She is and always will be the artsy girl with streaks of Electric Blue #1111 in her hair, throughout the course of the story she just becomes something more. Something more than the true blue loner she has always been. That development in her character is what made the book to me. 
 The pacing of this books was great! Lately I've been feeling like authors skip the 'boring' parts, but the pacing in this books was vey realistic. Rebel goes on a journey and we as reader get to make it with her. The journey itself is portrayed realistically as well. For instance, Rebel doesn't magically fall for Nate their relationship takes time to built. Family life isn't sugar-coated, but it's simply is portrayed as it is. Pen and Rebel's issues are very real and their relationship improves throughout the story. As does the friendship between Macey and Rebel. 
 With this provoking story Coriell manages to successfully portray the struggle that teens find themselves in when growing up. Rebel's quirky comebacks and comments made me laugh out loud, while other scenes in the book made my heart ache for her. Goodbye, Rebel Blue tells about the process of finding yourself and questioning your purpose from the perspective of a girl much like us. Goodbye, Rebel Blue is an engaging read and I would definitely recommend it to anyone that loves books with a deeper meaning!"
5,"OMG I WROTE A LONG REVIEW FOR THIS AND IT DISAPPEARED...... WTF...... 
 Here we go again..... a shorter version now cause I'm lazy. Don't judge... :) 
 READ THIS SERIES NOW!!! It gets better with every book! I cried, I screamed, I almost threw a book..... ALMOST!! A character I loved died and I was in a rage and denial...I am still not over it! Anywho... I will really miss my friends Pax, Servo, Ragnar, Victra, Darrow, and many more. A year is to long to wait for more adventures! DO YOU HEAR ME PIERCE BROWN!!!! TOOOOO LOOOONNNG!!! 
 One more thing I have a confession....I.... Did not like Mustang for a really long time... I kept hoping she would die.... But half way through the third book she became worthy. Or maybe I'm just jealous;) HAHAHA! Oh and I knew about you Mustang.... I knew about you missy!!!! And I was proved right in the very end!!! 
 In conclusion.... READ THE BOOKS Y'ALL!!!! BECOME A HOWLER!!!! BECAUSE I REALLY NEED SOMEONE TO FANGIRL WITH!!!!"
5,"How I love, love, love Maria V. Snyder! I honestly believe she is the real magician here. I was not supposed to read this book since I was already starting Pivot Point but then I saw a copy of this book at Booksale and I couldn't resist myself. I've loved Miss Author since I've got my hands on Poison Study. Even when I couldn't help but see the similarities of her characters in Study series with this book, I just couldn't help but love them. Avry was very much like Yelena - stubborn, resourceful, cunning, and pure-hearted. Kerrick was like Valek. I don't know why her heroes appeal to me so much even though they start as cold-hearted bastards as what Belen would say. They have this charm that I couldn't resist. Belen was like Ari; and Poppa bear was a very accurate description to the both of them. And I should stop with the comparisons. The point is, the story was awesome and you should find out why I liked it on your own."
0,Did not finish.
2,"I'm writing this on my iPad and it's hard to tell what the stars mean in the mobile version. Is 2 stars ""it was pretty much exactly what I expected Tina Fey is a funny lady there are some funny parts good enough for the beach glad I didn't pay for it?"" Because that's what I meant by 2 stars."
5,"First of all, can I just say that Lauren Oliver's writing is elegantly beautiful? The choices she made in her writing really worked to paint crystal-clear images in my mind, and easily got me emotionally involved with this novel. 
 Delirium is a true page-turner with a fast-paced and intriguing plot. The idea of love (in this case, amor deleria nervosa) being a disease was quite interesting and (at least for me) rather thought-provoking. Even though the reader is meant to know that love is not truly a disease, I sometimes caught myself seeing love from the antagonist's point of view. 
 The characters were well-fleshed and I was able to see pieces of myself in each one, something that always helps make a story relatable. Their social system was also very well-explained, but not to the point that I felt I was being overloaded with information. 
 I fell in love with this novel, especially because it has left me with so many questions, something I find rarely happens when I read a book. Why did the government label love as a disease in the first place? Just how much of America actually believes in the ""infection""? I can not wait for Pandemonium to come out."
3,"I enjoyed this one a lot, but it definitely felt like a first novel. I recently read The Fault in Our Stars and I can tell a huge difference in Green's writing style. It makes me wish that I had started here, but alas. 
 As far as the plot goes, I didn't see what happened coming. But I quickly became frustrated with the characters not figuring out what had happened sooner because it was one of the first things I thought of. I enjoyed the reflections at the end though. I would have liked to have seen them figure it out a little sooner and have had more of that reflection and character growth. 
 3.5 stars"

 Title: Some Girls Are 
 Author: Courtney Summers 
 Publisher: St. Martin's Griffin 
 Published Date: January 5th 2010 
 Rating: 4.5 
 Has anyone ever started a rumor about you? 
 This is the problem Regina Afton faces in 
 Some Girls Are 
 by Courtney Summers. 
 Regina is part of the Fearsome Fivesome, the clique on the very top of the social ladder at Hallowell High. The Fearsome Fivesome is feared by the students, yet envied by nearly everyone. But when they cast Regina out of the group in a freeze-out after nasty rumors were spread, she gets a taste of her own medicine. 
 Only worse. 
 Soon the entire school completely hates her, and lets her know by spray painting words like ""whore"" across her locker and posting awful comments and rumors about her on the internet. The people she thought were her friends beat her down not only mentally, but physically as well. They abuse her for a crime she didn't commit. 
 Regina becomes an outcast. The only people she can find refuge with are people she has abused in the past. Liz, a girl who was abused by the Fearsome Fivesome so badly she attempted suicide, is one of the only people who treat Regina kindly. She doesn't accept Regina as a friend or forgive her for what she's done in the past, but she is not mean to her like everyone else. 
 Regina is astonished that Micheal is the one person who she can actually call her friend, when she's the reason he is an outsider and a loner at school. She is even more astonished that she begins to have feelings for him, like more than friend. 
 Can you imagine this happening to you during your senior year ? 
 What I found compelling about this book was how much I hated the characters. You might think that's odd to say about a book I enjoyed, but I thought that was what Courtney Summers was going for when she wrote it. I think she wanted readers to see how truly mean teenagers can be when left with no consequences. 
 As a thirteen year old in junior high I know how teenage girls are prone to act. I haven't seen any girls bully to this extent, but I can see how it could get there if their actions had no repercussions. 
 This is a book that is very important for teen girls to read because it puts them in the shoes of someone who knows how it feels to be be bullied. It shows you, as a reader, the repercussions your words and actions have. When adults just tell you that someone is hurting that doesn't always change your view or teach you that what you say really does hurt people. By reading about it you see through the eyes of the victim. But Regina is not only a victim, she has victimized others and gets to see first hand how it feels to be treated how she treated others. 
 What made Some Girls Are interesting is that it was real. It didn't sound like an adult writing teenage characters how they should act, but how they would act in this kind of situation. I read this book in a day. I literally couldn't put it down, except for once to eat 
 And that was against my will. 
 I recommend this book to readers thirteen and up based on language and violence. I wouldn't stop younger readers from reading this based on the language because they've surely witnessed worse on TV, at school, or just hanging out with friends. If you're a parent and your kids are old enough to hang out with friends, unchaperoned, then they have probably seen this kind of behavior first hand, and this book might put things into perspective for them. If you are a teenager then you should check out this book because it might change your opinion on some of your so-called ""friends""."
2,"""What do you think of Sirantha Jax representing your interests on Ithiss-Tor?"" 
 ""Well, it's a bit of a joke, isn't it?"" 
 ""In what way?"" 
 ""What kind of training has she had?"" the girl demands. ""They may as well have sent me. I saw her for years, showing her tits on the midnight bounce. Table dancing, amateur soft-porn vids, drunk-and-disorderly conduct, barroom brawls . . . how does any of that qualify her to be an ambassador? It's damn near the dumbest thing I've ever heard."" 
 Yeah that's the thing, random girl interviewed in an annoying style-changing news report add-on. It is a dumb idea. It is also a dumb idea to go to a planet filled with aliens who want to kill you as an ambassador without any sort of security team or way to escape or a support team who actually know stuff about politics or the economy or anything. Also, not enough of the side characters and no one is any fun at all at any part of this boring story. I hope the next book is subtitled How Sirantha Got Her Groove Back cos she is lame-o right now, and I think she even knows it."
3,Kind of a mash-up of To Kill a Mockingbird and The Glass Castle. Pretty entertaining!
5,"So effing good!!!! 
 I really enjoyed the premise of the book and how Robin Hobb really develops her characters over a slow and steady time line. The action is continual and comes at the characters from many different sources - people, places, body and mind. Great fun to read and you know that it will be a series with many layered adventures. 
 Can't wait to carry on!"
4,So much more than what I expected!
5,I had to finish this one in one sitting. It was a beautiful story.
1,"I kept reading hoping that I would start caring, but I just didn't relate to any of what was happening."
4,"This was recommended by a friend ""for people who liked Bel Canto"", which she admitted was a stretch. I'm not sure I would have ever seen the comparison, but it kind of works. 
 I almost put it down after the first chapter or so, when I discovered it was a post-apocalyptic dystopia kind of thing, but after a while I liked it, and in the end I'm very glad I stuck with it. I liked all of the characters and all of their back stories, which is pretty unusual in a book with such a large cast. 
 Probably some of my friends would express logistical doubts that I never even thought of; the only thing I thought was off was that twenty-year-old bottles of shampoo wouldn't still have usable shampoo in them. 
 It was interesting to read this in Rwanda (as it was interesting to read The Hunger Games in the middle of the Amazon jungle). I kept thinking that it must have felt something like this here, in 1994; but I also thought about how afterward everyone here who survived would pretty much be just fine. Which is why (at least in part) I become more and more of a technophobe. She says from her macbook air on her 3g internet."
5,You can always count on Brandon Sanderson to come up with a great idea and masterfully bring it to life for a reader. I loved the book and I'm waiting for the next part of the story.
5,"4.5 stars 
 Beautiful but heartbreaking. If I had to describe In the Shadow of Blackbirds as succinctly as possible, that would be it. So different from pretty much everything out right now and so lovely, both in writing and its story. Cat Winters deftly explores humanity and just how far we will go to survive, even at the expense of others. It's a sad reality to face, but one that's important and not often explored in young adult literature. I don't think I can recommend this book enough. 
 It's 1918 and the United States is deep in the throes of World War I and the Spanish influenza. The American public is in a frenzy. If you're not dying overseas in the war, you're dying from the flu. With death's never-ending presence, people turn to the supernatural to reach their loved ones. Mary Shelley Black, a self-proclaimed girl of science, doesn't believe in the otherworldly. But when she has a close call with death and her deceased first love begins visiting her with unsettling stories, Mary Shelley may just have to rethink her stance, and find out why his spirit is not at rest. 
 I just have to mention that this is definitely a book worth reading in print form. I had an egalley, but won a print copy before I began reading, so I read the physical book. I compared the two, and the digital version just can't hold a candle to the beauty of this book. There are so many details on the pages and the photographs that just look better in the book. I don't think reading a digital version ruins the story, but your experience is definitely enriched. 
 What works best in In the Shadow of Blackbirds is the stark description of the people's state at that time. Mary Shelley visits a Red Cross ward, where soldiers are healing after being injured in the war, and she sees men who've not only lost limbs, but they've lost their spirit. We can't help but wonder at the real cost of our liberty, and who pays that price. Each person, when they leave home, dons a flu mask to prevent germs from getting to them. They chew onion gum and put bags of moth balls around their necks. Fear makes people not human, in a way, and this is shown so well. This all adds to the feel of the book, but it works even better to make it pack a punch to the reader. Also, without this setting, Mary Shelley and Stephen's story would've lacked immediacy and felt like any other book. 
 This is not a feel good, happy kind of romantic book. Yes, Mary Shelley and Stephen have a beautiful, honest, sweet relationship, but if you're looking for a happy ending, don't look here. The dark world presented is not one that gave a lot of happy endings like we've come to expect. But, we can leave with hope, something even better. Even in the darkest and most trying of times, one can always see a ray of hope and take comfort in the wells of strength in characters like Mary Shelley Black.

4,"Misa Amane, I love you... That's all I have to say."
4,"I'm glad I read this, if only because I'm a huge fan of Margaret Atwood and hope to read all of her works in the near future. This wasn't my favorite of her novels, but I enjoyed it a great deal. The relationship between food and femininity is a fascinating and often frustrating one, and this book is a funny and painful example of just how entwined they can be. 
 I can only imagine how tremendous the impact of this book must've been when it was first released. Some aspects of the story may be a little ""dated"", and things have undeniably improved in the years since this was written (in this society, anyway - the sad fact is that there are many places around the world where things are just as bad as, if not worse, than Marian's experience) but I still recognized and related to much of it. We still have quite a ways to go before stories like this are truly ""dated""."
4,"I really liked this. It was very quirky and great fun. I admit that conceptually it was all over the place and you needed a big pinch of salt with the whole time travel/literature jumping, but it really was so much fun. I liked the characters, even if they were a little cliche (goodies and baddies - no blurring of lines). I actually thought the story was very clever and a great idea, even if a bit silly. This is the second Fforde book i've read and the second enjoyed. Read this if you like the quirky - don't if you have no imagination."
4,"Man, third installment and the last till August. I am going to explode. 
 I think this book was a return to the interest that I had in the story, but it was not just because of the returning presence of Edward because I am now--and will forever be--a Jake fan. I just felt like this episode had a better balance of the interesting elements of the story. 
 That being said, now that I am this invested, I am going to burn all of the books in a blaze if the fourth won isn't FUCKING AMAZING. You heard me."
4,3 1/2 but closer to 4.
4,"I would rate this more as a 3.5 but I'll round up. This story was definitely suspenseful but relied too heavily on a romance that wasn't quite believable. However, I'm happy that I read it. It's definitely been the perfect book for this ridiculously cold weather! 
 Sidenote: Korbie is seriously one of the most annoying characters ever written omg."
3,"Downloaded on a Saturday, Started on the Sunday, finished Tuesday or so? Mid April I think."
5,"""I felt more of an emotional connection to the inanimate objects in this story than I usually feel towards entire characters in other books"" (p. 153) 
 I couldn't agree more. this book was lovely. more than lovely. indescribable and different and warm and wonderful and perfect."
3,"""Fear swelled, crushing her organs to make room for more of itself. It squeezed the air out of her lungs. It coiled, pythonlike, around her stomach. It forced its way up her windpipe, pushing, expanding, blocking every last sliver of open passage."" 
 ""Do not undervalue what you are ultimately worth because you are at a momentary disadvantage."" 
 ""I like him, but not enough to stand at the window and watch him leave."" 
 ""'And how will this extraordinary woman be treated? As well as a slightly-better-than-average man?' 
 'Better than that, I hope.' 
 'The extraordinary will always be treated differently--they're extraordinary, after all. What I wonder is whether a not-so-extraordinary woman will ever be treated the same as a not-so-extraordinary man.'"""
5,"Originally Posted on Debz Bookshelf 
 I'd heard so many good things about this book, so I was really looking forward to it. I'm really glad I was so excited for it, otherwise I might not have made it through. The whole story moved very slowly. Slower than I was accustomed to. There were some moments that it just felt like it was dragging. I was just about ready to give up, and then the excitement struck. The last 100 pages made me forgive the first 300 for their slowness. 
 Looking back, I'm glad it was slow. It fit the mood of the story. The writing was lyrical and rich with descriptions. The whole universe that was created was completely magical. These things wouldn't have been nearly as splendid if they were rushed. It went slowly so readers had a chance to soak up all the lovely details. 
 I could completely relate to Jena. If you want to know what I'm like, read this book. 
 On the other hand I couldn't understand Tati. She falls in love with a vampire who she can't have, then becomes paralyzed with her longing and turns into a completely useless wreck, who does absolutely nothing. The vampire wants her, too, but wants to protect her more. Sound familiar? It was like Twilight all over again! It drove me nuts! Thankfully the whole book doesn't revolve around this, but a large portion of it certainly does. 
 To make up for it, there's the relationship between Jena and Gogu the frog. It wasn't quite a romantic relationship, but it certainly was a strong one. Gogu seemed like Jena's Jiminy Cricket, always there to help her and guide her in the right direction. 
 All in all, this was an amazing book (as long as you don't pay much attention to the Twilight comparisons). I'm looking forward to reading more Juliet Marillier soon!"
5,"I think I like Balefire more than any other books of Cate Tiernan, because it exemplifies some of the best things about her writing: 
 1. Her ability to write about people without attaching labels or value judgements: For example, Clio is proud, vain, and arrogant, but never, ever does she say that she ""is trying to get rid of her flaws and be a better person"". The character grows, but never unbecomes herself (Compare Little Women, and it's obsessive dislike of individuality). Thais doesn't have these qualities, but the we-all-deserve-to-die attitude is interesting. Also, (view spoiler)[ Sophie loves both Marcel and Manon, but is never labelled bisexual. (hide spoiler)] 
 2. Her bleak outlook of the world is very agreeable to me, as well. The part where Thais asserts that all human beings are guilty is so true and accurate. 
 3. Her ability to let characters grow organically, rather than making them static, and changing their personalities when it suits her. 
 The one way in which Balefire is better than Sweep: Volume 1 is that it's much more in tune with its setting. Reading this book, it's impossible not to want to go to New Orleans! 
 It does seem like this series was rushed and incomplete, but it's easy to see why it sold so little: the copious drinking (some underage), the promiscuity, and the moral ambiguity are sure to alienate the crowd that likes *cough cough*, but those are the aspects that I like best about it."
5,A decidedly beautiful book.
3,"""I chose to take you today because there is nothing I'd rather do than be near you. I'm driving you because I'm a desperate man who will take whatever the hell he can get when it comes to you."" 
 -Rush 
 Don't be fooled by the 3 stars. I only give this book that much because I think Rush deserves some stars after dealing with all the bullshit that is Never Too Far. 
 Me while reading this book: 
 You won't believe how much stress this book puts me into. Half of the time I was reading this, I was homicidal. I was having a hard time controlling myself because I was sure breaking my iPad into pieces and setting it on fire will not be a good idea. Remind me later to buy a paperback copy of this book so I can tear the first half of it, page by page just to soothe my murderous feelings. 
 I will not even try to attempt to disguise this as a review because this is definitely a rant. And hell, there a spoilers here so if you don't want to read those then you can now proceed with something else and move on with your life. My face still hurts for all the facepalms I did to myself while reading this book so pardon me if I'm not in a very good mood right now. 
 I love 
 Fallen too Far 
 . It is one of my favorite books so you can't imagine how excited I was to read this book. Boy, I didn't know I was in for a big surprise. And it's not a pleasant one, mind you. 
 So how can a book almost made me want to massacre our whole neighborhood? One word: BLAIRE. 
 All the time, Blaire is like a freaking bomb that will eventually blows off everyone's asses! I understand she's pregnant and she's emotional, I've dealt with pregnant ladies before and God knows how much I thought they're mental, but God, there's just no excuse for this. Being pregnant doesn't make you brain dead! Blaire only cares about herself and doesn't even consider what's good for her baby! I hate those girls! Fine, you have an issue with the guy who knocked you off, big deal! But the baby has nothing to do with your fucked up life! Blaire knew she's POOR. And she knew how fucking RICH Rush is. But she planned on not telling him about her pregnancy at first because she thinks she can take care of the baby without Rush' help. Fuck it! That is just the stupidest thing I've ever read! 
 BLAIRE, THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU ANYMORE! You are going to have a baby and if you love him/her, you'll do everything to give him/her a good future, especially if you know yourself that there's a big chance of having that! Fuck your emotional baggage and start caring for something other than yourself! Please do not threaten to leave the town every other page just because Rush does something you don't like! GAH! I am so pissed off! 
 I really felt bad for Rush because this book is not really a big picnic for him. He does all the chasing. He does all the things to make their relationship works. Hell, he is even willing to sacrifice his family for Blaire. All his life, he is the one who takes care of his beloved, evil, and annoying sister, but he has chosen Blaire over Nan just to prove to her how much he loves her. But every time he does a small mistake, Blaire goes all overlydramatic again and threatens to leave again. And everyone blames him for everything even if his only fault is he kept a secret to Blaire. And that secret is not even anyone's fault except Blaire's father or as it turned out in the end: Georgianna! COME ON! Fuck that shit! Give the guy a fucking break! He doesn't deserve all the hate he gets in this book! 
 Imagine yourself having to choose between the person you love and the sister you care for most of your life? IT IS NOT EASY!. So what if Rush left poor Blaire for one week to care for his sister who is in a coma? He spent the entire past months proving to Blaire how much he loves her! Isn't that enough? Why does it always has to be Rush who needs to prove himself? The guy is torn between his family and love, cut him some fucking slack! 
 The only things that redeemed this book for me are: 
 Rush, I love the guy so much. Say what you want to say, but Rush is also a victim here! The way Rush fights for Blaire is courageous and lovely. I admire his determination and love for Blaire. This guy is phenomenal. 
 Woods. Because I have a crush on him. Screw me, right? 
 The Hot Scenes. The sex scenes are nicely done and doesn't feel trashy and porn-ish. 
 The Ending. I sort of forgive Blaire for all the stress she gave me when she sticks to Rush. 
 And oh, there's a bonus chapters from Grant, Wood and Rush POV! Here's the link: http://www.abbiglines.com/2013/03/673/"
5,"This book was incredible. Absolutely loved it. :D It reminded me so much of my favorite class from the semester that just ended for me, The Global Crisis. Things that we explored in that class became present in the book. Very realistic. This is probably one of the most realistic dystopias that I've read. Though scary because the story presented can very well happen in the our future. A future that will be dark and grim. Though I've enjoyed other dystopias, what makes this one of my top favorites is that this presents a world where natural resources have been exhausted, global warming is fully present, and the world is suffering because of it. Books like Feed by M.T. Anderson present a world that is technologically advanced and for the most part things are ok. Yes there are struggles with disconnection and superficiality amongst people, but in regards to food and stuff, things are ok. The Windup Girl on the other hand, as I already mentioned, shows the opposite of this. Which can very well happen soon with the way we are going about living in this world. We want to ignore that this is happening, but resources are depleting and the world is changing in so many ways. Take a look at China, who is steadily rising in power. And they're rising at a fast rate. 
 What I also liked about this book was that it reminded me of what I discussed in my class about progress. Progress sometimes isn't needed. Why do people need to keep using and using or creating and creating things for the sake of progress? Why do people associate this with progress? Why can't we let things be? There are still some countries where they don't really have roads and if you sit and think about it, it's not that big of a deal. Same goes for things like technology. What is the point of always advancing things like cell phone and computers and things? For money? Is it really helping our world in any way? Yes, we are connected to each other in a sense and that helps us learn about other countries and things in a faster and probably more efficient way, but there is also great disconnection between people nowadays. Everyone has their own personal world that they can be in because of technology. You can sit at home texting all day and be deluded into thinking that you truly are making connection with people. 
 I went on a tangent a bit, but wanted to get that out there. I also enjoyed most of the characters in this book. Particularly Kanya and her struggle to figure out what do with the circumstances she finds herself in. She was a consequentialist in a sense because of the things she chose to do to get to her goal. Or I should say goals that were given to her. But at the same time she wasn't fully at peace with being a consequentialist because she seemed to always be struggling with her choices and thinking about the things she had done or had to do. Was everything she did really worth it? Really enjoyed her character. 
 This is definitely one of my favorite books of all time now and would recommend it to anyone. So glad I bought it. :D And looking forward to getting Shipbreaker, which I'm pretty sure it's going to be as good as this book."
5,"This volume was so epic. 
 Everything was so tense, so amazing - I don't think my heart stopped racing! There's mysterious characters and shifting allegiances, there's awesome plans and then unexpected turns and it's all SO TENSE! Did I already say that? I literally couldn't stop reading, and it's been a while since that has happened to me. 
 The series overall really has a nice momentum. It doesn't keep you waiting too long for answers, and steadily introduces more intrigue, which allow it to maintain a fast and enjoyable pace. Cracking stuff!"
4,Review To Come
3,"While the book was insightful and charmingly written, I'm not as prone to gushing over with enthusiasm for it as some. There were a few impactful takeaways, to be sure. I feel far more informed of precisely what a Geisha is/was, while previously I'd been under the impression that they were purely entertainers.(Well, then again I suppose that depends on one's definition of 'entertainment.') Now I've come to the realization that, for hundreds of years, the lifestyle of a Geisha was rarely a chosen one. While beautifully depicted in its own way, this book defines it essentially as the aristocracy of slavery and prostitution. 
 If you love metaphors and word pictures, this book may very well delight you all the way through. For me, it steadily became more of an irritant. It felt as though they'd been inserted in every page as a covert way of lengthening the book beyond all common acceptability of the genre. And while the writing style is exceptional and the imagery vivid, there were a few things that knocked down my overall rating... 
 One issue being the main character's ongoing childhood romantic obsession with a married man who is at least 25 years her senior. This felt less authentic to me, and more like a mental illness, making the main character's growth feel a bit stunted. Also, from the reviews I was under the impression that there would be more of a grasp of sensuality throughout. Instead, there was the disturbing portrayal of molestation, objectification, and the general impression that a Geisha's sex life reduced them to little more than passive blow-up dolls. 
 (mild spoiler alert) 
 While possessing a certain desperate sadness from beginning to end, this was fortunately not a typical Asian tragedy. Though, don't expect a happily-ever-after. The heroine does not seem to grow out of a soul-crushing dependence on men, and settles for what feels more like a bitter-sweet mutually beneficial 'arrangement' after much bridge-burning. Accurate or not (and I know that is up for debate) the story itself didn't leave me with any real satisfaction."
4,"I really liked this series, but seriously did not like Elizabeth in this book. If it wasn't for poor Christian, I'm just not sure if I could have finished this book happy at all. I get that we go through rough patches, but I just really wanted her to get her act together. It was exhausting, and went on and on, and I think it just wore me out. As always, the writing was beautiful and of course you have to read it to find your closure in this series. I would actually probably give this one 3 stars, but I have to give 4 stars for this series, because it was a really great story!"
1,"All in all this book was semi entertaining but the writing to me was a bit lacking, which was surprising given the fact that the author has written something like 2 dozen books. 
 The main characters were in desperate need of additional characterization and interaction. I felt the relationship between Elena and Stefan to be too accelerated and fast pace without enough substance to back it up. My favorite character was a side character Bonnie who finds out she is semi psychic and supposedly descended from Druids while at the same time filling out the role as a popular girl at their small town high school. 
 I am reading the second volume though because just like the Cast's Hunted novels, each book ends with a major cliffhanger. So if I want to discover the 'end' of the story I must keep reading. Thankfully though they are super easy reads at just under 500 pages with a pretty large typeface. This one I finished in about 2 days."
3,Loved the idea of this and all the characters. I just wanted a little bit more from the storyline. I'm definitely interested in reading Casper's story next.
3,"This book is a dark, dark YA examining rape culture. Romy is the poor daughter of an alcoholic who is raped by her crush, the son of the sheriff and the owner of a national auto services chain. The rape is the set-up; the book is focused on the aftermath. No one believes Romy, and she becomes an instant outcast, scorned and bullied by all her classmates. 
 Romy's one escape is her part-time job at the diner on her town's border. Her co-worker, Leon, is a super nice guy with a thing for her. Romy, still utterly traumatized and refusing to open up to anyone since the rape, cannot even begin to handle a romantic relationship. 
 At the giant and legendary annual senior party, Romy is found battered and lost and another girl goes missing. If you think that Romy gets any sympathy from her classmates for what happened to her at the party, then you're not getting that Romy has been sentenced to unrelenting misery in this book. Romy's classmates blame her for being a drunken mess and wasting police resources searching for her instead of the more popular, beloved missing girl. 
 Summers provides an important look into rape culture, but it was not one I enjoyed. It was difficult to get through (which was perhaps the point) and as much as I liked Leon, his romance plotline was unhelpful. Romy doesn't need romance - in fact, she lashed out at Leon so much, a romance between the two of them didn't seem great for either Romy or Leon. Romy really needed friendship. Someone she could trust and rely on without the complication of physical actions. I don't know if I would have liked the book better if the romance plotline was dropped in favor of a friendship plotline, but perhaps."
3,"[Disclaimer: I won a copy of this book in the Goodreads First Reads giveaways.] 
 This book was like a hell of a lot better than the first one. It still had its problems, but overall the story was better, and the action a lot better too. It wrapped up very neatly (and I mean, pretty much every loose end is tied up), which is almost always a plus for me (I hate loose ends, especially at the end of a series), although maybe a little too neatly? Not sure yet. 
 Again though, the robot-like speech patterns of Emma is very grating to me, considering no one else in the books speak the way she does. And by now, since she is the only one who talks that way, I'm convinced that it was done on purpose, probably to show that she's a (view spoiler)[clone (hide spoiler)], but I *really really really* hated it. 
 Also, again with the over-writing of sex and sexuality. I've never known anyone whose body felt like it was going to turn to ash at the simple touch of their lover. I get that it was probably just to hype up the romance, but come on. 
 And I just need to bring something up because this bothered me the entire car ride home today. Authors, can we have a chat? (view spoiler)[I just need to let you know, I've read three - THREE - books in the last few months that all have this masquerade scene where the main character has to show up in disguise at a masquerade ball and get something out of there. First it was in Cress, then again in Sapphire, and now in Prototype. The motif is not exactly original and when I read three books published around the same time (like, within a year of each other), it makes me question exactly where it's coming from. And I'll tell you, with two of these under my belt, as soon as Declan invited Noah to the party I knew exactly where it was going. (hide spoiler)] 
 But I'm really glad I got to read this duet, as it made for some good quick reading. Again, it's nothing terribly high-fiction, but it was fun and enjoyable, and even though the sex wasn't realistic it was pretty entertaining. Overall, I'm left satisfied."
4,This was a really nice story and romance. The Sexy Times were not over the top and the sub-plot kept me engaged. I wanted to know what the hell was behind the locked door!! Seriously like 19 chapters and I am still trying to figure out what was behind the locked door and why he could not get married? I loved it!
5,"*Yep, tore me apart the second time reading it. 
 SO. MANY. TEARS. Why haven't I read more Morgan Matson books?! I'm so disappointed in myself because this was perfect."
3,"This was extremely sweet and endearing. I'm giving it three stars, but a very strong three stars. Macy, our high school protagonist, has created a very success-driven, controlled life for herself after her father passed away, but then takes a job with a wacky catering company where her coworkers are a very fun cast of zany teens. That sounds a little dismissive, they are are a zany cast, but it works in this novel in a cute way. 
 I liked it a lot as a romance, and I liked that while it wasn't overly long, it was substantial. You really believed that Macy has genuinely gotten to know her new friends so that the ways they impact her life and her worldview seem legit and understandable."
4,"September returns to Fairyland and finds it vastly different than when she left. Where are her old friends? Their shadows have been stolen into Fairyland Below, where Halloween, September's own shadow, rules and leads the nightly revels. I wasn't quite as enchanted with the first book as everyone was, but I definitely looked forward to this second book and getting back to the enchanting world of Fairyland. I didn't remember that in the real world in the novels it was actually historical fiction. But it is and it adds another interesting layer in this one. I like all the struggles and emotions that September is going through - they make her an even more interesting character than she was before. I liked the idea of the Shadows and how they felt familiar but were slightly different than the characters we had known before. I wonder if September will return to Fairyland for more adventures."
3,"3.5 
 This book was pretty good. It actually held my attention the whole way through, which has been a problem for me this past week. It's rare that I read historical fiction, but I enjoyed this one (for the most part). 
 The negatives of this book for me are mostly that the writing felt a bit withdrawn. Considering the subject matter I feel like this book should have wrecked my life, body and spirit but I only got a tiny bit teary at one part. And the end seemed really abrupt. You're in the story then all of a sudden, BAM! EPILOGUE!!! It felt really disjointed, like she just gave up. 
 I also feel some kind of way about how the ""romance"" was done in this book. I understand that she wanted to bring to light this specific historical event which is totally important. But the romance felt really thrown together and if that's the case I think it should have just been left out. 
 Despite these things, I would still recommend you try this book out. Especially if you like historical fiction."
5,"Alright, I read it! 
 I'm not big on space books, to be perfectly honest. I read Ender's Game and I loved it. But not enough to make me read the rest of the series. I loved Illuminae and I will continue that series (mostly cuz it's YA and not 20 books long). 
 So when this book became crazy popular and they made a movie out of it, I hemmed and hawed about reading it, putting it on my TBR with the hope that one day I'd ""read a grownup book."" I never thought I would, so I watched the movie to find out what everyone was talking about. I bought the book the next day. 
 I was hooked from the very first page. Mind you, I don't use language in my everyday speech, but man, if I ever started, Watney gave me so many one-liners. ""I'm going to science the sh*t out of this."" I mean, come on, how beautiful is that??? 
 This book is full of science, but it's not boring you-need-to-be-a-scientist kind of science. It's science brought down to a sarcastic, easy to understand format. I am glad that I watched the movie first, though. It helped me visualize the hab, rovers, and all the other fun stuff on Mars. 
 I don't know how Weir did it, but this fiction book feels real. I kept thinking how horrible life must have been for Watney on Mars. And then I'd have to remind myself that he really wasn't there. 
 Bonus: (view spoiler)[ the whole Ironman thing in the movie was highly ridiculous. I'm so glad the book was much more believable. (hide spoiler)] 
 The Martian has been my favorite read (by far) of 2016! And Watney is one of my new favorite characters. 
 Do yourself a favor and read this book! :)"
1,"The plot is stupid, the characters lack depth (maybe I'm spoiled by Marvel Now) and the whole thing takes itself WAY too seriously. 
 There is the germ of an interesting idea here - and actually I think the upcoming Captain America film might do it quite well - but it is so ridiculously overblown and the argument is so heavily weighted in favour of Cap that any moral ambiguity is completely lost. Fatuous."
3,It was a good ending to the series. I was satisfied with the wrap up of each character.

 Favorite Quote: ""Baby, I will always come for you."" 
 Seth is one of the most fierce Guardians to the evil Noir. Sold into slavery as a child, Seth, an Egyptian demigod, has spent thousands of years guarding and being tortured by one of the most sadistic primal source gods in existence. When Seth is commanded to find the Key, an artifact that can destroy the Greek Pantheon, he kidnaps the dream god Solin and tortures him for its whereabouts. When a beautiful young woman appears and tries to rescue Solin, Seth is both angered and intrigued. What must it be like to be loved so much that a person would risk their own life to save yours? When Solin promises the key in exchange for sparing the woman's life, Seth decides he must know who or what this woman is and gives Solin an ultimatum. Find the Key and return in three days or the woman dies. 
 Lydia doesn't understand why Solin was kidnapped, only that her orders are to free him at all costs. When she is captured by Seth and her powers drained, she finds herself at the mercy of a most complex man. Deadly and fierce; Lydia expects to be slain at any moment but this man confuses her. The mixture of man and child calls to Lydia and she begins to chip away at his armor until she discovers the man underneath. His inability to understand or accept simple kindness breaks Lydia's heart and she vows that no matter what; she will free Seth from Noir's clutches. 
 Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dream-Hunter series is a spin-off of sorts (the worlds very much overlap) of her Dark-Hunter series, which is one of the best selling paranormal romance series to date and for good reason. Speaking to readers of all ages and genres, Ms. Kenyon's unique twist on vampires, Greek mythology, and religion combines fantasy with paranormal romance to create a genre all it's own. Ms. Kenyon has enthralled us since her first book, Fantasy Lover. Filled with intriguing suspense, non stop action, smoking hot romance, and biting humor; this intense character driven series continues to enchant this reader. Well written with a fast steady pace that keeps the story entertaining and quite informative. What captivated me with this release is that is reminiscent of her earlier novels where the main story line and conflict all revolved around the hero and heroine. Since Acheron, Ms. Kenyon has spent more time building up the back story and introducing new plots in order to tie her convoluted world together. The Guardian takes us back to the familiar and we are given a tortured hero and a fantastic heroine who's story of love and sacrifice will hold you hostage till the end. 
 Seth became an instant favorite for me. He ranks with there with Ash, Zarek, and Jericho. Betrayed and used by everyone he has ever come into contact with, his ability to remain sane and actually develop feelings for Lydia is amazing. It's telling that when we first meet him he is covered in black impenetrable armor and his face is painted into a scowling face of a demon. Seth keeps his real self hidden and safe against any and all. 
 Lydia, a dream hunter, has had her own share of pain and betrayal so she empathizes with Seth. She tries hard to hate him but his fragility speaks to her heart and she finds herself drawn to her enemy. Ms. Kenyon's characterization of Lydia is perfect. Her gentle nature masks a core of unbreakable steel. When she finally understands the true extent of Seth's past, her heart breaks but she stands strong and does anything and everything she can to protect him. Even at the threat of her own life. Kenyon does the perfect job of allowing his and Lydia's relationship to move slowly as we become party to both his and her pasts. Going from enemies to lovers takes on a special meaning here as we watch Seth learn and experience the joy of having someone who loves him for him. I actually found myself tearing up at times when we are shown his intense joy to the simply things we take for granted-like seeing the sun. Or receiving a kiss that doesn't cause pain. 
 There are some pretty humorous moments as Seth's misunderstandings of the outside world land him in hot water with Lydia. 
 ""Yea,"" she snapped, jerking her head at him, ""You heard me. Incest doesn't run in my family, buddy. Just so you know."" 
 Okay, now he had the distinct impression that she was insulting him. ""What are you insinuating?"" 
 ""You're the one with the family tree that doesn't branch."" She illustrated said tree with her fingers. ""How many Egyptian gods slept with their brothers' and sisters' wifes' mothers' uncles' dogs? Hmmm? I ask you?"" 
 ""...have you visited your pantheon lately?"" 
 ""We're not talking about my pantheon, here. Are we? No. We're insulting yours."" 
 The main plot and subsequent sub plots are pretty intense as we discover more about the traitor in the Greek Pantheon and what exactly Solin's and Lydia's connection is. I love that we see some old faces; Daphne, Zarek, Ma'at, Jaden, and others. We even visit the Sanctuary for a brief time. We are given a pretty nice clue to the Egyptian Parthenon and where that storyline may be headed. My advice? Pay close attention to Seth. We have not seen the last of him. 
 The ending felt a little rushed but undeniably heartbreaking and sweet. We are gifted with a few surprises and given a HEA that rivals her earlier novels. Seth and Lydia are one of my top couples in Ms. Kenyon's series for me and I look forward to seeing more of them in the future. 
 Overall Rating: B+"
3,"This was an okay read, after reading the first book and really loving it I expected more from this book. It was good, but it just seemed to jump forward. We didn't really get the happy moments, it was more. Drama, drama, things get good, jump 4 months, drama, drama, drama. So it was a little frustrating to really miss out on that. I also had a hard time with the kidnappers being family and being accepted back by Blake. It just frustrated me, because that would definitely not be happening for me. I liked it but it was pretty average in my opinion."
5,"I'm finally finished!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 This is one of those books, much like Stephen Kings, where I'm reading and reading and I'm comprehending, but at the same time I'm confused, and the writing style confused me several times, jumping from one form to the other, one person to the other, one time to the other. But at the end of it, and looking back after finishing it, the only word that comes to my mind? BRILLIANT. I need to write the next one, like.. NOW."
4,"I CANNOT believe that this was a debut novel. Talk about finding a diamond in the rough. This story is so well written and beautifully executed. 
 We meet Blake who is in an emotionally abusive relationship with her childhood best friend. He is all she knows. She is constantly sacrificing for her boyfriend Justin and in turn all she receives is disappointment and heartbreak. Everything from Justin comes with a price. I am sad to say that at one point in my life I found myself in a relationship similar to that of Blake and Justin's. I think for this is one of the reasons I was able to relate to Blake on so many levels. And kudos to Ms. Lee for so accurately portraying the thought process of someone who is stuck in a situation like that. 
 ""I feel...trapped...sometimes. Other times, I don't know, he reverts back to the boy I fell in love with. It's complicated. I can't leave him, he'd have no one left, no reason to continue living."" 
 Enter Dash, the hot and sweet storm chaser in Blake's meteorology class. He is in a relationship as well. Over time Blake and Dash develop and intense relationship, becoming bet friends and spending all of their time together. I adored Dash and his willingness to give Blake the time she needs to heal and find herself all while standing by her side. 
 ""You know what they say the definition of true love is, honey? True love us friendship set on fire"". 
 This story was delivered flawlessly with an unique plot. There aren't many books about storm chasing out there. The adrenaline rush the characters experienced on storm chases is experienced by the reader as well, keeping the pages turning at a rapid pace. Not only is Edge of Chaos a thrilling tale of chasing storms, it is also a beautiful story of finding yourself and what true love really is. 
 ""I want every piece of you, because I know who you are, and I've never loved anyone as intensely as I do you"". 
 Im looking forward to reading the next book in the series. In the meantime, you can pick up your copy on amazon for just $0.99

4,"Alice Hoffman is one of the most talented and prolific authors working today. I'm constantly impressed by her talent and range, having pioneered the magical realism genre with Practical Magic, and gained further renown with historical fiction powerhouses The Dovekeepers and my personal favorite The Marriage of Opposites. 
 Faithful is in a similar vein to Local Girls and Blue Diary. It focuses on two friends who are separated after a horrible accident; leaving Helene brain dead and comatose, while Shelby is alive but struggles to come to the meaning of life in the wake of her own survival. 
 What really impressed me about this was how easily I saw myself in Shelby, as I think many readers will. She struggles with greif, loss, addiction, and the power and pain of growing up, and having to divorce yourself from who you are as opposed to how you think yourself to be. 
 The only thing that I thought could be improved upon was the length of the novel - I think adding 100 or so plus pages could have enriched the novel. I also think the shifting from the beginning about Helene, and the heavy ""miracle"" subplot could have been handled a bit better."
4,"Blake Crouch may be the literary worlds new Michael Crichton. He's not as good as Crichton... but darn close. 
 What Blake lacks from Crichton is a further explanation of the science. For those who read this and felt the science of quantum mechanics and string theory was too much for them; I actually think it's only because it wasn't elaborated on enough. However I do believe that everyone will understand the multiverse by the end of the book; at least at it's core concept. 
 A very, very fast read. Be careful you may want to stay up all night reading! 
 For those familiar with Wayward Pines the first few chapters may feel familiar but trust me that's the only comparison as Dark Matter becomes distinctly it's own story. 
 The ending... I was increasingly nervous of the ending as the story went on. Too many outcomes, would it be cheap, would it break the laws of science (even science as complex as dark matter), or just be silly. It's been a few hours since I finished this book and I'm still digesting the ending. It's not bad or cheap, it doesn't break the rules of the science... it just is. You'll have to read it to understand what I mean. 
 Anyone with a small interest in physics should read this. 
 Anyone who loves Crichton should read this. 
 Anyone who loves science fiction should read this. 
 And anyone who has wished for a moment they made one small change to their lives, and wondered how it would change this should read this (and isn't that all of us?) 
 While not a five star read for me it is still worth the read; if only to let Dark Matter mess with your head; and probably spark many people to google complex scientific concepts. 
 This review was made possible by reading an e-ARC via NetGalley. I would like to thank the publishers for giving me this opportunity to read it; as well as assure everyone this is my true, honest opinion. Don't believe me? Go read all the bad reviews I've given to other e-ARC books. ;)"
5,"epically awesome, the first book of the infernal devices trilogy is a absolutely stunning book."
5,"Plot- 9/10 
 Characters- 9/10 
 Writing- 9/10 
 World Building- 9.5/10 
 Total- 9.1/10 
 Quickie Review- This book absolutely lived up to the hype. The world building was great- the factions were done brilliantly, the city of Chicago was revamped (or is it devamped?) into a perfect yet very imperfect dystopian setting. I was worried it was going to be similar to the Hunger Games, but as the book went on, it cemented itself as a beautifully written and original dystopia. The plot was fast, exciting, and left me breathless at times. The characters were all done very well, especially Tris, Jeanine, and Christina, who I found to be well-developed and complex. It did take me a while to like Four, because in the first half of the book he came off as icy and distant. When he warmed up to Tris, though, my feelings toward him changed. All in all, a must read for all dystopia lovers. Be sure to check out the movie that's coming out soon starring Shailene Woodley and Theo James!!!"
4,"Yes, this book is about a horrible person doing absolutely horrible things. 
 Yes, it gets four stars anyway. 
 Very well written. I was fascinated by the POV and the way the author wove the story from the first page. I couldn't put it down."
4,"Stuck hauling her PIA mom's wedding dress across the country, Laney winds up in first class (yay), next to her polar opposite...and opposites do attract. Very cute, though I wanted to shoot the mom."
4,"3.5 stars. The main character starts off wishy-washy and selfish, so it was kind of hard to feel sorry for her or believe she could grow into being a badass, but by the end of her journey in this book, she makes a huge transformation and I was rooting for her. The blurb makes you think there is a love triangle, but that's not necessarily true; she's definitely in love with one particular person at the end. For the first half of the book, the author does a neat little trick of writing chapters from both boys' POV anonymously, so in the beginning the reader is not quite sure who is the assassin and who is the prince and it makes for an especially anxious and tense feeling until the reveal. I didn't like they way the assassin's true motives were so ambiguously written and his subsequent actions confusing?...contradictory?, and even though I knew what Pearson was trying to do, I think that could have been executed better."
3,"Ok, I know EVERYONE loves this book. 
 I didn't. It was just OK. 
 I thought it was incredibly well crafted but I also thought that it was crafted in such a way so everyone would talk about it. Which does not make a book a great book in my opinion. 
 The back and forth drove me nuts. I had to check if it was 4 month and 3 weeks, or 4 month and 2 weeks. It was confusing to know if it was further in the past than the chapter before or if the story moved on. And the back and forth between the main characters - whew. And the secrets. For Pete's sake. The secrets and why things were done, were so far fetched and over the fucking top. I skimmed, and skipped along freely, because the book lost me month ago. 
 So, here we go again, a crowd pleaser turned into a bore. yay"
5,"Why did I wait until I was a Freshman in high school to read this??? I would've LIVED for this as a kidlett!!! 
 Oh well, I'm reading it now and I loved it just as much"
3,"Meh. 
 455 pages. Might have been better at 300. I suspect the TV series wil be better than the book. 
 Strike is OK, although I thought we were off to a bad start with the old, tired ""private eye just scraping by"" thing, and of course his main squeeze ditched him, and there's a bottle in the lower left drawer and a gun in the right, and then the blonde walked in, yawn. But in the end he's a character we can be getting on with. 
 Robin is annoying and unbelievable at times, but by the end she has been consistent and her character has filled itself in and she is believable after all. 
 I don't mind a mystery with a complex plot and plenty of detail. It's all there, and it all fits together. But how many characters do we need? Do we need to know that a character was wearing a Rene Ladouche tie, one of a series of only 100 released in 2011 to select shops in Milan, made from virgin silk shipped from Thailand on late 2010 on board M.V. Frabjakovian Queen, captained by Johann Versteeg and famous for being on time except that one time when the storm caused confusion in Rotterdam harbour, no I tell a lie it was a Thursday, because it was the day before Mildred's pie came out all runny? 
 The dreary interviews and meticulous assembly of details, and the annotation thereof, are quite believably necessary in the modern world. But they are not very interesting to read about. 
 Too many brothers and sisters and half-fathers and step-uncles. Especially when the whole mess is the basis of the plot. A plot whose ending does indeed mesh with everything we were told, but is nevertheless unsatisfying. It's not the ""Aha! Of COURSE!"" that we hoped for; more of a ""yeah, OK, I suppose"". And it makes a lot of the earlier details look like the author being clever than actual real things that each nudged us inevitably to the Aha! moment. 
 And of course the hero gets laid, because that's expected. Of course there's a final confrontation in which our hero leaves himself insanely at risk -- but we know it's going to be OK because we have been told, repeatedly and unsubtly, about a certain skill that Strike has, and it's so obviously a Chekhovian gun that we know he has to use it (and no, it's not an actual gun). 
 I don't feel that I wasted my time, because at least I know what a Rowling mystery is like. 
 I'd like to know what happens next to Cormoran & Robin, but I'm not sure I want to spend 455 pages finding out. Maybe there'll be a graphic novel ..."
3,Kind of strange.
4,"*4.5 stars* There's a reason why I stay away from hefty epic high fantasies - they run longer (thus hefty) but that means we have more time with the characters, getting to know them and being thoroughly invested. Thus when a tragedy does hit, and that seems to be an inevitable trademark of this genre, it hits that much harder. (I'm still stinging from that final one I don't think I'll be picking up Well of Ascension nor any high fantasies any time soon or ever. Yes, it was that fatal. At least to me.) 
 Final Empire is told in third person, multiple POVs but focused primarily around the two main characters, Vin and Kelsier, and then a smattering of the secondary casts that added a great deal more depth and excitement to the plot. Usually I'd hate multiple POVs but Sanderson kept them short and tight, not enough to drag the attention away from all the fun, but only when the story moves a little to the side and we'd want to know how their side of the story played out. So it's cool and very refreshing. 
 But that character development for Vin and Kelsier though. LURVE. They're really far from perfect, even when they at first seemed to be. Perfect, that is. Kind of. Vin's that easy-to-love protagonist who's been dealt a shit hand in life, who's beaten down and suspicious of the world, but who's still kind and have I mentioned powerful? Yes, she's that #kewl YA protagonist everyone loves. But along the way she has traits that are questionable, which makes her that much more relatable. For example when a friend is in danger, the unrealistic loyalty the usual YA heroines almost always possesses makes them rush into the fray and save the day against the odds, but Vin tries to persuade Kell and the gang not to and gains the disapproval of the crew? That's realistic human behavior, ok? And Kell. I love that man - he appeared charismatic, witty, irreverent, smart, and just larger-than-life and generally infallible a guy when we first meet him, then we start to see how his character starts to have lingering grey areas around the edges. 
 ""I warned Sazed I'd be dropping by sometime during the trip."" 
 ""And you didn't tell me?"" 
 Kelsier winked, pulling the door shut. ""I figured I still owed you for surprising me in that alleyway last week."" 
 ""How very adult of you,"" Vin said flatly. 
 ""I've always been very confident in my immaturity."" 
 But have I mentioned I loved Kell? I want my firstborn son to be called Kelsier, First of His Name, Lord of the Mist, and (view spoiler)[BRINGHIMBACKPLEASE my bleeding heart please stitch back together sometime in the near future I can't function like that (hide spoiler)]. 
 Some would find the dialogues and world-building draggy, but I honest-to-Lord Ruler didn't feel it at all. I have just started my internship (and work life sucks), so I only got to read Final Empire in bits and pieces, but it's been thoroughly engrossing. I felt that Sanderson did a brilliant job interweaving world-building in those dialogues - the cultures, the magic the people and their CRAZYMILLIONS of religions. I wouldn't say it's the most masterful of world-building because we've only really seen the Central Dominance and some of the outlying areas, but the vastness that is talked about is enough to paint the picture, I feel. And after the build up from the planning and training and subterfuge, I inhaled the last quarter of the book (kind of, until that happened) and neglected all manners of sustenance and hygiene. The whole plot and ending was ingenious and the twists were so masterful, it was such an adventure the whole time. #RESPECT 
 I would definitely recommend this to fans of adult high fantasy (which I don't really read and my only real comparison is Game of Thrones?? Hehe ops) or those just now only wishing to dabble in it, but I forewarn it is not for the faint-hearted, or really not for those who likes their happy airy-fairy HEA in YA high fantasies."
4,This was a beautiful book. It broke my heart one moment and made it soar the next.
4,"First published on: http://ringothecat.wordpress.com/2012... 
 After her very engaging debut novel Amy & Roger's Epic Detour, Morgan Matson is back for more! Second Chance Summer has many of the same ingredients that made Amy & Roger so endearing and such a great, great summer/beach read (and I use this term with the greatest respect possible!): there is a flawed yet likeable main character, there is a life-changing story about loss, yet there's a sense of optimism that permeates every page of this excellent sophomore novel. 
 Taylor Edwards and her family used to spend every summer at their summer lake house in the Pennsylvania Pocono Mountains. That is, until 5 summers ago, when something happened that made Taylor run away from things, which is what she always does when things get hot. This summer, however, she will no longer be able to escape conflict and she'll have to face her past, as her family have decided to spend this summer at the house once more. Taylor will be forced to confront the reality of her family life, her past (ex-boyfriend Henry and ex-best friend Lucy) and hopefully come out the better and stronger person at the end of it. 
 The strength of Second Chance Summer does not lie in its original plot (yes, all of the inevitables do happen), but in the careful treatment of its characters. Matson takes her time introducing Taylor and the rest of her family. She switches back and forth between this summer and 5 summers earlier to show how an individual can change over the years (what you found oh so important at age 12 may seem petty at age 17!) and how it's never too late to fix what's wrong and it's never too late to get to know the people you are close to. The way that Matson treats her characters and the hopeful optimism of her stories made me think of Sarah Dessen, with which she also has a certain earnestness in dealing with emotions in common. Moreover, she also has that natural flow in the use of language and a dash of humor interspersed in the novel now and again. What is most important here, though, is that I believe Taylor when she says that she doesn't know how to confront a problem. I also believe Taylor when she says she's done something incredibly wrong and Henry and Lucy should hate her for it (even as an adult you can see that it's a typical teen reaction of blowing things way out of proportion). And I also believe Taylor when she is forced to take that second chance yet doesn't really know how to... 
 Matson is definitely a writer who understands how to write believably about grief, loss and falling in love all over again. Second Chance Summer is the type of book that the adjective heart-breaking was invented for. This is a story about a girl meeting a boy. It's a story about a girl and her grief ... and it's also a story about a girl growing up ... And, for the cat, Morgan Matson doesn't even have to wait until next summer to publish another one of these!"
5,"Gawd, Thank goodness the day I am finishing this novel I get to leave work early and drink with friends. Because how am I supposed to work after reading this? 
 It is as if Dickins had written L4yer Cake."
3,"Much like no. 7 in the series (The Vile Village), I found this book extremely forgettable the first time round. And while I found the plot more engaging, and fuller this time round, I still have the strong sense that over the coming weeks and months, I will forget this book in the same way I did the first time round. 
 I am a little disappointed that I am finding, once again, that the further I progress with the series, the less entertaining and memorable the books seem to become. For someone who loves the misery and bizarre circumstances that befall the Baudelaires, it feels odd to struggle to progress through such a small children's novel. 
 That said, the inclusion of Esme Squalor as a villain accomplice and girlfriend to the evil Count Olaf is welcomed, both to add an extra element to the story, but also to add a layer to Count Olaf, who was starting to become somewhat stale and predictable."
5,Brilliant!
5,"** spoiler alert ** 
 I finished this book well over a week ago, and my heart still hearts thinking about it. I get an ache in my heart and I remember how hard I cried once Tris dies in the infamous chapter. I cried all the way to the end of the book. I hurt for Tobias. I understood why Roth got stuck killing her off. It was to show that Tris was not invincible as she had seemed to be in the entire series. Maybe she just couldn't see a happily ever after for Tobias or Tris. I know I couldn't. They both had a lot of issues. I am glad they got to have sex before she died, but it's crappy for Tobias. 
 The ending of the book soured the series for me. I won't read it again unless I want to ball my eyes out. 
 There were things that happened in this book like finding out her mom was not born in their world. They got to see the outside world and realized Chicago was an experiment to test whether people were pure (divergent) or not pure (not divergent). There was new people introduced. They killed off Uriah as well, and I hurt for Christina. She couldn't get her boyfriend to live or a replacement friend in Uriah and loses her best friend. Tobias' father disappears and Peter gets his memory wiped. I feel like he got a second chance, but it is sad that he couldn't work through his issues. I hate that Peter was a bad guy. I like redeeming people who make bad choices. Peter doesn't get that chance. He even has a speech where he says he is tired of feeling good about doing evil things. 
 So sad."
5,"Um, why didn't anyone tell me how awesome this series is? I would've absolutely adored this series as a kid. I think that Violet is a really great non-stereotypical strong female character. She loves physics and makes crazy awesome inventions to help out her siblings. I also love how smart Klaus is and how both he and Violet love to read. Lemony Snicket's writing is dark and witty but the plot is not overly violent or gruesome. Also, I highly recommend the audiobook version because Tim Curry's narration is perfect."
5,"Ooh, I loved this! Marchetta opens with a fairytale gone horribly wrong (tonewise, if you picture Cate Blanchett as Galadriel relating the loss of the ring of power in LOTR, you wouldn't be far off), and then settles into more workmanlike prose to tell the story of Finnikin, Evangalin and their friends as they work to break the curse on Lumatere. 
 The old-school writing won't be to everyone's taste, but I'm finding I'm a bit jaded by the breakneck, melodramatic style that seems to be favoured by lots of YA SFF authors at the moment. Personally I enjoyed Marchetta's no-nonsense prose, which can still be extremely moving and lyrical when she wants it to be."
5,Hot hot hot!!! Blake is one bossy SOB! I just loved him!:*
4,"Do not read this when you have a cold or the flu. Or even allergies. It'll make you very, very uncomfortable. In the same way that hearing the word ""itch"" makes you itchy, reading the beginning of this book will make you feel like you might have the plague. 
 The first quarter of the book is about the outbreak of a superflu, and (I'm pretty sure this isn't a spoiler) the rest of it is dedicated to what happens after most of mankind is wiped out. It's part science thriller, part apocalypse, part dystopia (or maybe utopia depending on how you want to look at it). There's a lot of good stuff packed in here. There's discussion about society, religion, morality...it's all here. 
 There are a lot of characters to keep track of, and there are bound to be a few that you feel awfully attached to. The book is easy to follow, easy to read. It may be over 1,000 pages, but it doesn't feel anywhere near that long--a huge accomplishment on the part of King. 
 This is my second Stephen King novel, and I'm beginning to wonder if he has a problem with women. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt for now, but I do want to just note it here. If that kind of thing bothers you, maybe skip this one. Here's a quotation from the strongest female character in the novel: ""Women's lib...was nothing more nor less than an outgrowth of the technological society...Before civilization, with its careful and merciful system of protections, women had been slaves...And the Women's Credo...was just this: ...Thank you, Men, for the hospitals, the police, the schools. Now I'd like to vote, please, and have the right to set my own course and make my own destiny. Once I was chattel, but now that is obsolete...Thank you, Men. 
 ...lying here in the night, she knew that she needed a man. Oh God, she badly needed a man. 
 Yeah, seriously. And like I said, that's from the strongest female character. The men in this book seem to view women as things (no, not really people) that needed to be protected. Those are the good men. The bad men in this book viewed women as sex objects. And the women, every woman that rated more than two sentences, either needed a man for protection or traded herself for sex in one way or another. There are clearly defined roles for the men and women even in this post-societal world. This hits the root of anti-feminism to me: women can only overpower men when they use their sexuality. And when they do, it's sneaky. I'm not a fan of this viewpoint. 
 Okay, so that long rant may not sound like me giving him the benefit of the doubt, but I still gave the book four stars, didn't I? I had a hard time putting it down (which is amazing considering it's over 1,000 pages long) and loved the ideas behind the story. I've read apocalyptic fiction before, but this takes you through the whole thing from the beginning when the world was normal."
4,"This is one of those rare books that is uncomfortable and awkward to read, yet so damn addictive. Like a siren's song, it pulls you in and makes you want to know what's going to happen. I kept putting it down and then immediately picking it back up to read again."
3,"A touching, heartwarming book. Great premise with good characters, but a little unbelievable and almost too convenient with the plot points that happen throughout the story."
4,Cool start to a series. I like the world and the magic in this one. Eli is an interesting character. I look forward to the rest of the series!
5,"As soon as I got finished reading this book, I texted a friend and said, ""If I could put one book into the hands of every 13 year old, this is that book."" 
 Want to Go Private? is a powerful, moving, and emotional rollercoaster of a book that is not only horrifically accurate, but gracefully written. Sarah Darer Littman pulls no punches as she describes how easy it really is for a predatory to worm their way into your home. 
 Abby is the typical American teenager. She feels awkward, out of sorts, and in that horrible transition period between middle school and high school. It's, quite possibly, the worst time to be a female. Abby finds solace in a boy/man she meets on a teen chat site. Luke listens to her, cares about her, and seems to be genuinely interested. He says and does all the right things to make a 14 year old girl fall hard and fast for him all in the comfort of her own bedroom. 
 I love the way Littman breaks this novel down into three sections. It starts with Abby, chronicles her first few months in high school and shows how Luke it able to prey on her. How he gets her to do things she wouldn't usually do because he manipulates her needs to feel accepted and loved. The second part is told after Abby is gone, from three points of view: her younger sister, her best friend, and a classmate. Their alternating perspectives help piece together what went wrong with Abby at home and at school. Finally, the last section deals with the painful aftermath. 
 I won't lie: This book had me cringing and grimacing at several points. Littman has a tendency to get a bit graphic, but I really feel like it was needed to drive the point home. Abby does things on her computer, for example sending topless pictures of herself to Luke, that horrified me. I think what scared me the most is that I was Abby growing up. 
 Did I send naked pictures of myself? No. But I was a 14 year old girl who felt horribly out of place in school because I had just moved and I found solace with internet friends ... some who claimed to be boys, but looking back now, I think they may have been adults. The difference is, my computer was angled so the screen faced my door (which I wasn't allowed to shut while on the computer) so that my parents could see everything I was doing when walking by. At the time I thought they were insanely overprotective and determined to take away my privacy. 
 I see now how smart they are, and I can't thank them enough. 
 Parents need to read this book. Teens need to read this book. I cannot find the words to recommend this book enough."
2,"2.5 stars (?) 
 I am not sure what to say about this one.. because I skimmed through it really fast.. OK honestly I stopped reading DOWN LONDON ROAD when Jo and Cam finally (view spoiler)[ were together (hide spoiler)] and went to the epilogue..So I practically do not know what happened between the moment I stopped reading and the epilogue. not really an ideal reading method but I was just not into it. 
 I really liked ON DUBLIN STREET and was glad that Braden and Joss were part of the story.. but, unfortunately, DOWN LONDON ROAD was just not my cup of tea."
4,"Actual rating: 4 
 I really enjoyed this book! It had well developed characters, a good plot, a well built world. I just felt like it lagged at times which is why I left off a star. Nonetheless I did throughly enjoy this book!"
2,"I've refrained from reviewing this series because it is not six stories, it's one story split into six books. I have to say, I'm not such a fan of this series. 
 The author brings things up a lot in conversation between the characters, but then seems to decide that he doesn't want to elaborate, so (and this exact same exchange happens a ridiculous number of times over the six books) one character will say something vague and ominous, and a second character will ask about the ominous thing. The first character will say ""Trust me, you don't want to know"", and then the second character will say ""No, I really do want to know"". And then the first character ignores the second character. 
 Second, to me it seemed that the author didn't really plan out the whole story at the same time. It is revealed that one of the main characters (that expounds on her family in the first few books) that has a never before mentioned twin. That it is said that she has disowned, but has nothing but warm fuzzy thoughts about for the duration of the time that she exists. 
 Also, elements that are extremely important in the last book are only introduced in the last book or two. There's no hinting, you can't guess. It's like it's not even thought about until something is needed to fill in a gap. I don't know about you, but I prefer a Chekov's Gun to a Deus Ex Machina any day of the week. 
 Last...I'm only sort of sure that a manager of a paper supply company from Scranton didn't write this."
1,"Did you ever try something different - an unusual combination of ingredients for a dinner, an avant-garde idea for a painting or composition, an unique decorating scheme - and realized when you were done that you not only missed the mark, you didn't even hit the target at all? Then you are smarter than this author, who missed the target and yet still managed to get this book published. (Maybe she IS smarter than I give her credit for being!) The past, present, and a bit of the future lives of these twin sisters meander all over the pages of this novel. If you combined the twins into one woman, you still wouldn't have a person with the common sense God gave a goose. At least geese have instincts! It might have been worth reading if this book had an actual plot, if it had believable characters, or if it caused me to care even a wit about what happened to them. It doesn't, they aren't, and I don't. I finished reading it because it was chosen for one of my book clubs. I did my assignment -I read the book. I deserve a gold star - this book deserves a rewrite."
5,"Excellent, as always. Review coming."
4,"I really enjoyed this book, it was different from the genre I usually read. It was provacative and alluring and an all out good book."
5,"Well done, Ruta Sepetys! A great book. Heartbreaking, but nicely written. 
 This book is a novel, but is actually based on history, during WWII. this story is written from the perspective of a teenager named Lina. she and her family are taken from their home in Lithuania by the Soviets. This story tracks the next year plus of all hardships they go through. The labor camps, the illnesses that struck, the deaths of fellow Lithuanians, cruel degrading treatment and more. 
 much is known about Hitler's reign, but what about those sent to Stalin? What of the voices never heard? This is one of those voices, crying out after all these years. The imagery if vivid. You see how lives are lived, you see the love and pain and sorrow. But it is more than that. you feel it. this book literally moved me to tears. 
 The is a hint of romance, and much community love. There is loss and heartbreak. There is pain and suffering. There is hope. The characters are endearing and so well done. Lina is one amazing young woman with all sure endures. 
 If you are looking for a happy, upbeat book, this is not it. This novel shows how Lithuanians (and other people too) were treated during the war. It is well paced, and starts off with a bang with the Soviets coming for the girls family right at the beginning. It is brutally honest. It is not always easy writing about such treatment from a young teenagers perspective, but this captured it perfectly. My only complaint to the book is the chapters were too short and I wish I could have continued on Lina's story a little longer. 
 *I won this as a First-Read giveaway on goodreads.com. all thoughts and opinions of this review are strictly my own.*"
3,"2 1/2 stars 
 I liked the parts about the dogs, but the interactions between the humans set my teeth on edge."
4,"The Age of Miracles is part of a recent trend towards literary novels of the apocalypse (Zone One by Colson Whitehead, The Rest is Silence by Scott Fotheringham). Even more specifically, it could be called a slow apocalypse. No asteroid smashing into the planet, no massive pandemic, or other theatrical forms of the apocalypse here. Instead, in this novel, the rotation of the planet is slowing, which is disastrous, but in a slowly building way. 
 Coincidently enough, two years ago the History Channel ran a mini series of 'what if' scenarios, and one of them was what if the world stopped spinning. I remember being kind of horrified by it. This book takes on the same scenario, spread out over a number of years, and from the point of view of a young girl on the verge of maturity. The changes the world undergoes are mixed in with bullying, crushes, and friendships broken. 
 Julie starts the book as an eleven year old. She has a friend, Hana, and a crush, Seth. Suddenly, one day, the spin of the earth starts to slow. Initially by just a few minutes, but then to larger lengths until days are more than 72 hours. Most of the book centers around Julie, as well as her neurotic mother and her doctor father who are having marital problems. Her mother promptly starts hoarding foods, while her father wants to just keep going on as normal. 
 Just as interesting is the background of how the world adjusts. First it's by instituting that people will stay with the 24-hour clock, which leads to a seperation of people called 'Real-timers' who go with the natural day, and end up ostracized as a result. LDS followers go to Utah to wait for the final days. Then there's the effects on migrating animals like birds and whales, and crops. Then the planet's shielding against radiation is affected. And then there's the effect on gravity (barely perceptable) that causes illnesses in people like Julie's mother. 
 Julie has a great voice, which is good since the book is from her point of view. Her life pulls you in, and even after the afterword (set eleven years later), you want to know what happened to her. But after watching that"
4,"Really liked this book after a slow start, it's a good solid horror thriller and I'm looking forward to reading the other books in the series. The twist at the end with Kolabati came as a big surprise."
0,"Too many unnecessary scenes and details for me. 
 It was cute and all, but I feel like there's no depth. 
 But despite that I'm curious of the ending so I read the last two chapters. 
 It was a happy ending. I guess, all good."
3,"This is so much better than the first one. It's like it was written by a different person. 
 I'm glad this focused more on character development rather than kinky stuff. Kinky, without plot and development is nothing and I am pleased with this one. 
 Ana still manages to annoy me. I was pissed at her reactions after Christian told her the truth. I hate how it seems to be judgmental even though she didn't voiced out her opinion. She's always coax the person into telling her everything and bolts out whenever the truth is laid in front of her. Seriously, Ana.. you already know that the man is very troubled and what he's going through is not a piece of cake. 
 I'm glad the author took time with Christian's unwrapping. It would be a shame if it was rushed. His past managed to place a black hole in my stomach while the truth was reveal and I was in awe. It was greatly written, in my opinion. 
 Another plus is that this one explores other characters, new or old, and I expect to know more about them in the third book. 
 Meanwhile, I am curious what would be the third book's issue because for me their marriage and Christian overcoming his demons is already enough to end the series. 
 Wow me, James."
2,"2.5 stars 
 I was taken in by the lovely cover. It is so nice and refreshing with all the YA covers sporting some girl in a prom dress. I liked the idea behind the book. The book did everything right--story wise. The author followed all the rules, however the book didn't resonate with me. The writing was repetitive and it got on my nerves. Also, the whole time I read the book, the writing made me feel like my mind was in a fog as well (as the character). I know this was done purposely, but I wasn't too fond of it. Sorry."
4,"So good, and so disturbing. Parts of it dragged a little bit, but the ending -- WOW. I can't wait for the next book!"
4,"Much better than the previous JJ chapter! 
 This time I enjoyed the plot and the surprising final :) 
 Since I'd spent asleep grand part of the night and this book was my only comfort I'll give it 4 star, even if they should be 3.5 ;P"
3,"There are some qualities that I really enjoyed about this book and there are some aspects of this book that needed some work, so I am somewhat torn on my rating. Let's start with the good: 
 The World Building - I know many readers do not enjoy being dropped into a civilization with thousands of years of history and many different cultures without any explanation, but this is personally something I enjoy and what Bakkar does well. Bakkar is very Steven Erikson like in this aspect... you will not be spoon fed information just for the sake of information. No ""Oh hey Bob, remember that time we fought together 4 years ago at such and such place and this is what happened?"" Won't happen. You are dropped into the world and expected to put the pieces together little by little. 
 Magic - Going to get a little spoilery here. I thoroughly enjoyed the Dunyain's Logos. It's an interesting take on cause and effect and how your actions and words can control future events. Combined with the different schools of magic you get a good combination of typical fantasy sorcery and more intellectual magic. 
 Now the Bad: 
 Characterization - After finishing this book, there are very few characters that I have any emotional connection to (maybe Achamanian?). I don't need to love every character or have every character be black or white, but I need to care what happens to the characters. The depiction of women is also portrayed a little crudely for me. Every female character is defined by their relationships to men. 
 Ending - This entire novel is rising action. I realize this is a trilogy, but there needs to be more than setup for future events in over 600 pages. 
 Overall, this was a good read. Nothing that is going to blow you away, but Bakkar has piqued my interest enought to continue on to the second novel. I would recommend to people who enjoy worlds with history and a more dark, gritty type of fantasy."
4,"25 years before Dracula there was the lesbian oupire, Carmilla! 
 By modern standards, the pacing was perhaps a little slow but it matched the mood nicely. The language was, not surprisingly, a little antiquated but not overly difficult. 
 Anyone who enjoyed reading Dracula would probably like this. If nothing else, it's a very quick read and gives another view of the Victorian fascination with vampires."
5,"I did something with this book that I never do; chose it because of the cover. It was such a pretty looking book, and I chose it on looks rather than substance because the blub didn't give a great indication of what the book was about. In the end I really liked the book, mostly because I loved the idea of a fantasy circus that actually does involve magic and wonder. Then in the middle of it all is a love story between two people who are supposed to be at war against each other, but find there is something more. They begin to build rooms for each other in the circus, and some are truly magnificent, such as a ice garden. The circus is a place of the imagination, and if something like this actually existed, then I don't think I would ever want to leave it. There is a rich tapestry of other stories and events going on in the background that add to the majesty of the circus. Some of it I felt was a little too much, or detracted too much from the story, but there were others that were beautiful in and of themselves and could have had their own book dedicated to them if the writer so wished. The writing is simple and lovely, and this writer certainly has the motto of show and not tell. Because some of the circus is creations of the imagination, the writing can sometimes get lost in the description and I found myself lost once or twice in regards to where I was because the writing just wasn't detailed enough in some areas. For example, in describing some of the tents, since they have been created by magic, they are often difficult to explain in a short amount of time and sometimes I found myself lost in regards to what the person was doing. For a random pick up this book was fantastic and I really enjoyed it. And at the end of the day, I really wished a place like this existed."
5,Very noice!
3,I would give 3.5 stars if I could. The dialogue is madly brilliant - the array of self-absorbed characters talking at each other is amazing. There is no plot though. Ignatius looms large as a comic character but it is also a sad one. The book reads like jumping from one embarrassing comedy skit to the next - some brilliant but often pitiful as well.
5,"Great sequel. The author did an amazing job with adding the Raffe's POV. There are some scenes we saw his perspective from Angelfall. I loved those scenes. 
 YA are usually not my favorite, but this one is very well written with amazing characters and a story that has you wanting more. My only concern is that there are 5 books in the series. There is not even a title for book 3 and no word on when it will be released."
5,"These books just get better with each one! This one was really great. I laughed a lot in it, I like that the heroine isn't a complete incompetent and often saves the day, I even like the hero (which is odd for me as I usually am put off by the typical alpha-Were in these books). Kate did have to be saved in this one but it wasn't insipid and it was because of a personal sacrifice she made that probably couldn't have been handled any other way - not because she was being a frantic, stupid martyr. I've been saying I wanted a heroine I could respect for a long time. Kate Daniels is that heroine. Now I'm anxiously awaiting the 4th installment, due on May 25th, 2010."
4,"This is mainly a bunch of scientific stuff, told in a blog POV. Being myself a former Physics grad student (never finished it, don't miss it at all), a lot of that was familiar, in a way or another. It's actually a nice guide on how to solve problems when you have to do it all by yourself. And Mark was a creativity master! 
 Hidden among all the science, though, is a very beautiful story about not giving up when it all seems to have gone to shit. Not going insane, holding tight to the smallest sparks of hope. Mark's journey had a lot of ups and downs (and sand, lots of it), no SciFi shit, no martians, nothing like this to impress us besides pure, real science. And potatoes. 
 Knowing this was written for fun, posted for free in a blog and all, makes me really happy. This is how writing as a hobbie feels to me and I loved every second of it. 
 As for the most important thing in the book, which is Mark's humor, all I have to say is that I would say/write very similar stuff if I was in his place. I tend to over-humorize things when I'm all fucked up. So I get it all. 
 I'd never go to mars, though. See, I couldn't even get to finish Physics grad school, NASA would probably not want me, right?"
5,"6 stars! 
 But really, it was still just as beautiful as the first time I read it."
4,"Super cute! I was very intrigued by the premise of this book (porn star love interest? ok!) and I wasn't let down! This story is also very funny and I found myself with a big goofy grin on my face while reading this book. The friendships in this story were flushed out really well. For example, I felt like Zoey was my best friend too and she wasn't just some side character. The only thing I didn't like was all of the poop and fart jokes (yes.. I'm a little bit of a prude, I blame my Virgo moon). Definitely recommend this one! 
 Ohhh Tristan *swoon*"
1,"I didn't particularly enjoy the first two books in this series, so why I didn't just give this one away (complete-itis??) is a question I didn't have an answer for. Tbh I found Shay more interesting than Tally, and had very little investment in any of her relationships. When That Big Thing happnened, I just...didn't care. The world building felt a little shoddy and preachy and all the random ellipses really bothered me... 
 I found Tally boring. I didn't enjoy spending time with her and found her frustrating. And while the comparison isn't fair or reasonable (very different books/characters), this just felt like a poor mans Katniss even though THG didn't come out til '08 and this was published in '06. (Though I hated Mockingjay more than I hated this book b/c I didn't care that much about this book. Which, you know. Not better.) 
 Let's be honest, this was probably just not my thing? So. Yeah."
5,"Hooray! Patience paid off. The library copy of Catching Fire that I had been waiting for since September (having joined the list in July) finally arrived, just in time for me to take it with me on vacation. It was a perfect reward for a solid month of writing. 
 In any case, it was worth the wait. It's as good if not better than the first book. My only complaint about Hunger Games was the wait-for-the-sequel ending, especially since I couldn't figure out where a sequel would go. Many series are just stretched out for the sake of selling more books, with no real action happening in the middle, or with the middle serving only as a placeholder/setup for whatever comes next; others are content to just hit the same notes in every book, and give the reader a reinterpretation of the same things that satisfied them about the first. Happily, Catching Fire is nothing like that. It explores more of Panem, goes into themes and problems hinted at in the first book, and propels the plot forward in a big way. The main characters are still well-motivated and complex, though some of the peripheral characters are a bit stock. The new twists are nail-biters. My only regret is that I have to wait a year for the next book."
3,"3 stars 
 I must say I was quite dissapointed with this book as I expected much more from it. I can't say I didn't like it, but I definitely can't say I liked it. Does that make sense? Oh well. The first half of the book was amazing and I'd rate it with 4.5 stars... but the other half was just bleh. I think there was just too much of cheesy and cliche and straight out stupid moments. I don't know how to put it really, but the heroine was at some point just too naive and too stupid for my understanding and liking... sometimes she made great choices, but at some points I was just facepalming myself. And the hero... okay, he sounds like a delicious piece of meat... he had some great moments.. but to draw that red line and to sum his character up, he had this double personality. At first he was this troubled persona and then all of a sudden that troubled persona dissapears. He goes from this distanced kid to over-affectionate one. Ok,I guess? I mean, he was sweet and hot and everything but i think the author doesn't really know how to limit emotions... i feel like she couldn't find the golden middle of it..some of his scenes were just confusing and stupidly thrown in. 
 Sex scenes were phenomenal. I mean seriously phenomenal. All the sexual interactions between the hero and heroine were great and with tons of chemistry.. but I felt, again, that that chemistry went to extremes when not involved with sexual tension. Or there was just too much of it (chemistry), or there was none of it. 
 The ending was nice, but I was misssing something there... too cheesy maybe? I just didn't feel the ending...no, actually I didn't feel this book, but i liked it without liking it. I can't really explain how i feel about it so I'm going to be neutral and rate it with 3."
4,"Mary Kubica's best novel to date!! 
 Don't You Cry alternates perspectives between Quinn and Alex. Quinn's roommate, Esther, has vanished during the night. When Quinn starts scooping around she starts discovering things about Esther that makes her question everything. 
 Meanwhile, Alex is working in his small town's diner when he becomes smitten with a woman that he has never seen before. He is curious about her and is excited when she wants to become friends. However a girl like that must have some sort of history. 
 Reading the summary at the beginning of the novel, I was hesitant. I told myself that I would curse this book if Esther was Alex's mystery woman. Thankfully Mary Kubica is better than that and you have no what the relationship is between the 2 stories until much later in the novel. 
 The story was a bit slow paced as there is some history with both stories, but once the story gets going it is really hard to put down! I went into the late hours of the night last night trying to finish it and the ending is not a disappointment!! 
 I would recommend this novel to those who love a good thriller and like alternating story lines. I'm excited to see what else Mary Kubica can come up with!"
2,"Well, every time I attempt a bit of a scifi romp (!!) I end up feeling like I am lacking some fundamental scifi appreciation gene. This book has been translated into English (and a bunch of other languages too) and will be released in late June. The premise is excitingly meta and mildly scifi-y so I really thought it would work for me. It only sort of worked. I think lots of people will love this book though and will be keen for Palma's other works to be translated. Those who make an appearance in this story: H.G. Wells (major player), Bram Stoker, Henry James, Jules Verne, John Merrick (aka The Elephant Man - this was my favourite bit) and Jack the Ripper. the story is trisected and while the 2nd and 3rd sections are mostly seamless, the 1st section felt like (once I had finished the novel) a self-contained piece of writing. I became attached to a character or two and was then wondering when they would reappear? 
 So, if we could give half-stars here, it would be a 2.5-star read. I think, though, it could be a big summer book. 
 I wouldn't listen to me on this one."
4,"Actual Rating: 3.5 
 This was a cute read. The characters start off hating each, but then they start falling in love. I thought Shephard Prescott was an adorable character and he proved to me that he is boyfriend material. He was a true gentleman. Jade Frost was a little bit different to understand, but then when she fell for Shep, I started to understand her a lot more. I think this is a good book. The most shocking part of this book is when (view spoiler)[ his mother called Jade a gold digger (hide spoiler)]. Overall, an okay read."
1,"Just atrocious. Please, let's encourage teen girls to seek out toxic, manipulative, abusive, controlling men that will let them live in the lap of luxury...."
5,I read this novel years back and I still always come back to this series. It is definitely one of my favorite series out there. This was a great starting novel and the author plotted everything correctly.
4,"So I'll start off by say this review probably won't make much sense to you unless you have read this book but it's hard to review something without giving away the surprises to sorry in advance. 
 I loved this book, the way their relationship began was most definitely not the most ideal of situations but it was written so beautifully you believe everything they are saying. 
 I loved how it wasn't insta love, at first they really didn't like eachother and from that it turned to friends then to a relationship. It was definitely slow blossoming romance and I loved reading every part of it. 
 And then towards to end something happens and it made me hate it for a minute. You know with some books angst is needed and dramatic things happen and it makes you need to read on? Well it wasn't needed in this book, I was so in love with this story that I didn't need that to happen. But it did and I kind of hate that it was put it there. Don't get me wrong there is a happy ending but it wasnt enough for me to give it 5 stars because it annoyed me so much. I know a lot of people with probably disagree with this but I can't help how I feel and it gutted me a little, it didn't ruin the story but for me it made it feel so unfinished and rushed, like the author had no clue what to write so she slung in some unnecessary angst to get people going. Faaaaaak!! I really wish it didn't end like that!:( 
 Other than that this book for me was beautiful and funny and it just drew me in, sucked me up in a world I wanted a part of. 
 So other than that at ending I totally loved it, and it might just be me with the ending. Someone else reading it might loved it.

5,"This book is original, fantastical, and gloriously strange. It has the texture of a dream and a fascinating mythology all its own (well, informed by existing mythologies, but it feels very fresh). I had some confusion with an early plot point, but everything was gravy after that."
4,"4.25 
 I first encountered this author when she submitted a hot little ficlet for a prompt picture, and after reading that, I was delighted to find out there'd be more. A lot more. Inertia is the first of three stories with Gavin and Derrick, and I'm looking forward to the next one already. 
 Derrick's a loner, huddling in on himself to prevent any more hurt coming his way: at a young age he's already had more heartbreak and loss than many people coming up on retirement. It's easier not to take risks or get involved, a dog and some good friends ought to be enough. But Gavin does a come-closer-maybe that Derrick finds intriguing, and in spite of himself, he gradually does get involved. 
 Gavin comes with plenty of baggage, which unfolds slowly. Maybe he's not really relationship material for Derrick, maybe he's a bad idea even for a weekend's amusement. Or maybe, he's worth it. 
 Gavin has issues guaranteed to poke Derrick's ""no way"" button, but his combination of flirting, honesty, and a bit of vulnerability make him extremely alluring, and Derrick comes closer in spite of his best intentions. A scene where Derrick goes out on what he tells himself will be an aimless drive ""just to clear his mind"" swings him like a pendulum between ""not in this lifetime"" and ""right now."" Very nicely done, and just lovely when he finally arrives at Gavin's door. 
 This story does have a number of serious issues to address, and takes none of them lightly, but it never devolves into an angst-fest. Instead, we have two grown men making themselves a tiny bit vulnerable with each revelation, and each understands that the other could bolt at a moment's notice. Derrick's the man most likely to disappear from inability to deal, and tells himself that he daren't come to care for someone who could put him through the wringer and then be gone. 
 An atrocious ex with no face time hangs like smog over the couple, and several issues relating to him get explored, though not resolved. It smells like sequel bait, which is fine with me; I want to know how they play out. For the moment it's enough to see Derrick and Gavin come together in spite of the obstacles. 
 A few things bothered me: I wasn't entirely convinced that Derrick could sleepwalk through his twenties quite as completely as he was portrayed, and I was also concerned about Gavin's stability, since he hadn't been ex'ed from his ex all that long. A friend from the past popped in from Central Casting long enough to make some cogent points and then disappeared; she didn't have much to say that couldn't have been handled by another friend with a more ongoing role in the story, but perhaps I'm being too picky here. 
 This is Amelia Gormley's first book, and in spite of a couple niggles, I think it's a strong and entertaining piece (I accidentally took a long lunch at work because I was engrossed). The writing is very fluid and the sex scenes very hot, and when the heck is Book Two out?

4,"Wow, so I didn't know how a sequel could possibly follow Maze Runner and be just as good. In fact, when I first started reading it took me a while to get into this book, but once I warmed up I ended up liking it almost as much! 
 I would have liked to have read more about the other group in the trials: the girls, and some of the Teresa/Brenda/Thomas stuff was weird, but generally this is a smashing sequel. Just as gripping and thrilling. 
 WHY ARE ALL THESE THINGS HAPPENING? WHAT IS GOING ON?? Damn, I 'spose I need to read the next book..."
4,"This book was everything that I hoped it to be and more. I loved the way Greek mythology was In the story and the way other ancient events were in like the references to the battle of Troy. 
 I really liked the characters and the way that each god was dying in a different way. I found the love story haunting and beautiful at the same time. I loved the chaos in the book and I loved how gods were not all good. 
 I was a little disappointed that we didn't get to see more gods but I guess that is why it is a trilogy. I loved the story between Cassandra and Aidan. I was upset that there wasn't more of a shock when you found out who Aidan was because it was highly hinted at the back which was a let down. 
 I will say I hate the ending. It had me in tears and I did not like it one single bit. I don't understand why it happened and it is putting me off wanting to read the rest of the series. 
 4 stars out of 5"
3,"I loved Lockhart's writing here and the ethereal quality of the narrative. The characters were too flat for me, though, and (view spoiler)[I figured out the great secret at the very beginning of the novel (hide spoiler)]. 
 It's a VC Andrews-ish story with a somewhat social bent."
2,"ARC provided through NetGalley for an honest review. 
 2 Shoelace Stars 
 This is Lacey Mosely's story, Kate's sister from 
 True North 
 . She's been watching her sister and Trevor build their life together for the past three years and is a little jealous of what they have. she's resigned herself to the fact that, because she lives in a very small town, she may never find what her sister has. 
 That is until Jake Holt comes back into her life. Jake was Lacey's high school secret boyfriend. They had very different social circles, but somehow found each other. Lacey thought she would end up with Jake until he disappeared the day after graduation. Now he's back after flying Trevor and his family in to Crowell for the birth of Trevor's child. 
 Lacey and Trevor have to get over the obstacles of the past, the dust storm trying to get between them, and fears of what they want out of the future. Will Lacey be able to give Jake what he needs? Will Jake be the guy she always thought he was to be in her life? Hurt feelings, death and lots of email play a part in this couples future. 
 I'm really sad to say that this one fell really short for me. The first two books were cute and funny, with a few sad moments. But in this book, up to about 50% of the book was mostly Lacey thinking about Jake, thinking about what Jake said, emailing Jake, etc. It was a lot of internal musings, which is fine if something is happening. But nothing happened. Even when things happened, it felt like nothing happened. 
 I'm still going to give Ms. Blake the benefit of the doubt on her next book, because I really enjoyed the first two in the series."
3,"Hmm. 
 Not sure how I feel about this one. 
 Reminded me a lot of We Were Liars. 
 Definitely made me cry. 
 Kind of mad at it. 
 Probably the best Lauren Oliver book I've read. 
 As you can see I can't formulate proper thoughts..."
5,"Hehe, it was really interesting while reading this. I have the feeling that I was a Hogwarts student reading a school library book, in which many Harry Potter Big Fans would probably imagine themselves to be at Hogwarts while reading Harry Potter books. 
 Now, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them did provide a great deal information about beasts that live in the Magical Community, and once more shown the detailed and imaginative thinking of J.K.Rowling. She provided many appealing creatures, description and origination and all, plus the danger level. 
 Even though it is not a story, it is a good documentary-guide book for those who want to examine the Wizarding World."
5,Beautifully written.
4,"If you can buy the ""love at first sight"" then the rest of the story was sweet, cute, and endearing. Avery, our prickly heroine, runs down the hallway and bumps into Cam, almost doing a faceplant, except he's there to help her. He almost runs her down with his truck for their next meeting, and then it turns out he lives across the hall in her apartment building. 
 With that out of the way, Cam is like the perfect book boyfriend, loyal, quick to forgive, and persistent. He plays friend for most of the semester and every time Avery runs from him or cuts him off, he comes by and tries to talk to her. It helps that he has a huge ego and is not as easily hurt or demoralized by a woman who constantly turns him down and makes snide remarks about him. 
 Without seeing his point of view, we don't have a clue why he is enamored with Avery. Sure, she's probably pretty, but there are pretty girls everywhere on college campuses. We don't know if he's aware that she has psychological problems. There's no indication he is clued in at first. Avery's best friend Brittney is a psych major and suspects something, but Avery is able to hide from her questions too well for anything to really come out. 
 It was pretty easy for the reader to see that Avery had been sexually abused. This is a common trope in New Adult literature, and I was eager to see how this author handled it, particularly since a lot of stories use it for shock value and then pass it off as easily solved by hot, hunky, boyfriend who melts heroine's resistance. 
 Ms. Lynn develops the story better than most. Avery is damaged and exhibits avoidance. She is also uncomfortable with certain positions and wonders how she'd respond if he tries to take things too fast, which he doesn't 
 The ending is satisfactory since Avery confronts her ghosts and resolves her feelings for Cam. Of course, who wouldn't? He really is a knight in shining armor. I, at least, couldn't see any flaws in him. Even his supposed secret was justified and made Avery wish she had someone who cared about her that much [which she does now, but not before] 
 I did notice quite a few editing problems, garbled sentences and typos. One even changed the meaning of the sentence when Cam said he ""hadn't"" been with anyone else, the typo said ""had""."
3,"Narrator Max Lehnen 3 Stars 
 This was not my kind of book. A nice in between books but nothing special."
5,Dragon Marked is an entertaining read that is fast paced with likeable characters. You get to know the characters pretty easily. The world building is not quite as fleshed out but I enjoyed the story. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in this trilogy.
5,"""Healing hurt."" 
 I thought this was a trilogy. I honestly thought this was a trilogy. Imagine my surprise (and distress) when I realized the story ended here, in this book. No more Yael. No more Luka. No more Felix; no more Adele. 
 It all ended here. (What a heartwrenching ending that was, too.) 
 I never really know what, exactly, to say about books I loved from beginning to end, so I try to let my rating speak for me. Five stars, no less, people."
5,"I absolutely love this book. It's such a great graphic novel that not only covers two princesses who fall in love, but also tackles some important topics. We have Amira, who is carving her own path despite society's expectations of her, which also assumes that she doesn't have a care in the world. We have Sadie, who has been trapped in a tower by her sister who is verbally abusive and demeans her. We have Vladric, who succumbs his family's expectations based on his gender and finds himself stressed out and stuck in a tree. Together these characters overcome their road blocks and empower themselves. 
 It's perfect for children because it takes these important messages and delivers them in a fun, entertaining, and understanding way for them. Amira has dreams of becoming a hero, so she sets out to become a hero. Sadie has had her self-esteem torn to shreds by her sister who tells her she's fat, ugly, and stupid. She overcomes her fears and her sister with the help of her friends. Vladric things he has to be extremely masculine and defeat trolls and ogres, but discovers that he doesn't have to change himself and discovers not to judge people based on how they look. Plus, Amira and Sadie fall in love during their adventures together and the story points out that there's nothing wrong with that. It's such a great book that delivers important messages in a cute and funny tale. I hope that more books like this start to become more prevalent, and I am looking forward to checking out more of Katie O'Neill's work."
4,"This lush, dreamy historical novel set in the early 1800s on the island of St. Thomas tells a somewhat fictionalized account of ""Father of Impressionism,"" Danish-French artist Jacob Abraham Camille Pissarro, focusing mostly on the story of his mother, Rachel--her girlhood on the island, her first marriage to an older man with several young children, the death of her first husband, and then her unexpected love affair and long marriage to her husband's nephew, Frederic Pissarro. While the language was quite beautiful and I found this to be an absorbing read, I never felt quite connected to either Rachel or Camille, perhaps because the world they lived in is just so foreign to me."

 WHAT KIND OF AN ENDING IS THAT?! 
 I CAN'T WAIT FOR TWO YEARS!! 
 First of all, took me a LONG time to finish it. Last week wasn't so good. 
 Okay now, review: 
 ""A knowledge of what?"" 
 ""That I am going to die,"" Clary said. ""Not a long time from now. Soon."" 
 Me:*drops the book* WHAAAAT?! Cassie NO! 
 I KNOW that this is TDA and the ""main characters"" here are the Blackthorns and Emma. But hey, I am not forgetting TMI so easily okay?! One of my longest book hangovers was over it. I love TMI characters and can't bear it if anything happens to them. After all I spent six breathtaking books with them. 
 The love triangle: okay, I expected a Julian-Emma-Mark triangle but apparently it is Cristina-Mark-Kieran. It's kinda a complicated one with Cristina's previous relationship with Diego and the tension between Mark and Kieran. Am I the only one who feels sorry for Diego and wishes that Cristina ends up with him and that Mark and Kieran get together again? Because, you know, I loved them together. 
 The ending: Ah you are ruthless Cassie. Leaving us fans like that. Hanging in the middle with chaos in our hearts. THAT endiiinnngg!!! That end! I'm sorry, I JUST finished the book and the feels have not finished harassing me yet. So I am allowed to be repetitive. 
 PS please put Emma and Julian back together. My heart is breaking. And the exile... The Angel knows who the new Inquisitor be and what terms he will dictate of the exile. God, I want that next book NOW. I need to know so much and this damned second book ended this way!"
3,"** spoiler alert ** 
 This story was interesting. The MC is a red blooded girl in a world where the silver bloods oppress and control the red blooded. 
 The story was well laid out, well thought out, well structured. The characters feel very real. I only had issue with Mare's hate for the silver blooded people. Although the feelings are understandable, hate only ever breeds more hate and can't change things. 
 Then Mare and Maven decide on targets to kill that was a big turning point. Now they have made a decision about who dies, that was so wrong. She should have refused to participate in any actions that went that far."
3,"Gosh, this book was so silly. But hey I rather enjoyed that, silly and sugar cute and idiotic. What a mix. 
 When I first saw the 1181 I went all nooooo! Cos yeah, no! Hey do not get me wrong, I love that time. But because I love that time I knew I'd nitpick everything and there were a lot of things wrong with this book. can forgive things if they had been 600 years later but here, no just no. I will not get into all those things because I tried to be all let it go, let it go. And pretend it took place later on ;) It does seem the author did study up on one thing, birthing and the church but you know, I do not need a infodump when every day life is all wrong. But LET IT GO. 
 Judith is sweet, perfect sweet, says what is on her mind and everyone loves her after 5 minutes. Yes the all hate her first but then she is being all sweet and telling them what to do and like sheep they follow. I just read it with a smile in my face and though honestly. 
 Iain was your typical says nothing at all highlander who went all MINE! Back AWAY SHE IS MINE!!! But never really said anything. 
 The plot is, eh, right, she stands on her porch. Bunch of strangers show up. She asks them if her friend sent them and then they all leave . Her alone with a bunch of *let it gooooo*. Ok everyone falls in love with her. She rescues babies when they arrive. An the big bad secret is that her dad is an enemy laird. But it all works out and they live happily ever after. 
 It worked better with the let it go. A silly silly historical."
5,"Oh wow, 
 having read other Coelho books, and not been impressed, I've wanted to read (because I've heard a lot about it) ""The Alchemist"" for some time but I've kept postponing it. 
 I'm not one to believe in omens but I have to admit that this book fell into my hands just when I needed it. ;) 
 Either way, it's a pretty simple story, it has a simple message in a way, and the journey is lovely. Though you will read the phrase ""personal legend"" so many times it starts to lose all of its meaning eventually. 
 It's short, it's engaging, funny and charming. 
 There's no reason not to read this book."
5,"All I can say is: I NEED TO GET ME A MEDIEVAL MAN. 
 I stayed up until eleven o'clock on the night before my last day of junior year finals just so I could finish this book. A bad decision on my part? Possibly. But I have exactly 1001% no regrets. 
 Do yourself a favor and read this book. It's uplifting and has some pretty epic female heroines (not to mention MEDIEVAL WARRIORS *swooning* and the sweetest romance) and it's got time travel to medieval Italy. Um, what more could a book give you? 
 Love. Just, so much love. I wish I was as cool and bad-A as Gabi."
3,"I'm a huge fan of this series, but I have to say this is not my favorite as far as the storyline goes. Reddix and Nina are great characters, and their interactions and how their relationship unfolds is really interesting and their chemistry is off the charts, it's the thread in the storyline that connects it to the series that just lacked umfph for me. Still can't wait to read the next book...and the next. 
 Three Stars and Five Wet Panties. 
 Review by Miranda at Mommy's a Book Whore."
4,"Finally, another book about friendship within the LGBTI community, between a gay man and a gay woman as the focus! It also featured friendship-not-love type relationships alongside romantic ones which was nice. I felt this book really captured what a close, immediate friendship feels like. I also felt it captured the spirit of the LGBTI community, where the older ones welcome the younger with open arms as they appear at their first gay bar, or pride parade, or so on. I also really loved the descriptions of the final Pride weekend towards the end of the novel. I'm going to have to head to San Francisco at some point to experience it myself (not that I wasn't planning to do that at some point down the road anyway). 
 While the writing wasn't the most complex and the dialogue a little unbelievable at some points, it would definitely suit the teenage audience it was targeted towards. Will definitely be shoving this at any twelve to sixteen year old I come into contact with."
2,Read this on a dare. Not my style.
3,cliffhanger ending. Not a stand alone book. Remind me of older books i used to read.
4,"This surprised me, I had mixed reviews about this and I wasn't sure if it was going to be something that I would enjoy. But I actually really enjoyed this. 
 I actually really enjoyed the art and the colour palette, it grew on me as the story went on. 
 I found it really impactful to see these small glimpses of peoples lives and I really liked that everything was left very open ended, this just felt very true to life. Having said that, if a sequel showing more of Rose and Windy's lives was published I wouldn't be upset."
3,"WHile I got what Wolitzer was trying to do, I really felt no sympathy for any of the female characters and felt that the male characters (with the exception of one or two) got the shaft (pun intended). I think it was crucial that you buy in to the magical element of the novel, and I did not find it convincing at all."
0,Read through Blood of Gods (#5)
4,"Ivey takes a Russian fairy tale and transforms it into a beautifully written novel with great characters, lots of mystery and the fierce, but breathtaking nature that is Alaska. As this story unfolds you absolutely are whisked back in time and place to a time where American settlers are trying to find their way in a place with the harshest climate that can at times be tough and cruel to its inhabitants and also with a land that nearly defies being domesticated even with the most backbreaking labor. 
 Mabel and Jack are some of those early homesteaders who in essence escaped from their families after a child is born dead and no subsequent children are forthcoming. There is a lot of hard work and many lonely days until unlikely new friends are found and a ""magical"" child appears. From that point on, the mystery unfolds yet is never really solved. The story can be seen through different eyes in differing ways, yet the easiest may be just to take it as it comes without question and without pause enjoying life to the fullest in the present and accepting the small gifts it brings."
4,"I'm gonna be honest with you, this book was okay. There were some things that I disliked about this book: (view spoiler)[ the subtle one-sidedness in Patroclus' relationship with Achilles, Patroclus' sudden crazy talent with medicine during the war, the sexual encounter between Patroclus and Deidameia. (hide spoiler)] All things that were either unnecessary or could've been changed for the better. 
 However, the reason this review is 4 stars instead of 2 or 3 is because this book was one of the first of the summer to make me a complete, emotional wreck. I hadn't read a book that would make me want to draw cheesy fan art and write poetry for 3-4 days straight until I read this book. The beginning of this novel is so heart-wrenching I could cry just thinking about it; because Patroclus' story is not only just sad, but deeply profound. Those first few chapters prevented me from even thinking about putting this book down. And I don't think I'll truly ever stop remembering about the pain and the angst that he endured in his early childhood. 
 If you read M/M fiction, and like historical fiction, definitely give this book a read. It might be worth your while."
5,"I didn't think it would be possible for me to love any other Tarryn's Fisher's book as much as I loved The opportunist. I was so wrong. Marrow now is my favorite work of hers and it really is spectacular. The writing, the characters and the storyline - all together was perfection. Loved it times 100, and it, definitely, trumps any other book I have read in 2015"
2,"Competent, not very exciting space opera. 
 It's not a good sign that on completing this book I looked in my notes to discover that I hadn't read books 2 and 5 in the series of 6 - and at no time did I have any sense that I'd missed anything. 
 We got unmemorable characters - indeed, the most interesting of the lot is the AI that wants to run an animal shelter. 
 We got folks crossing the galaxy, and WEEKS into the trip we have a guy making sandwiches. Jack, dude, along with explaining your version of the adeledicnander drive you have to explain your 22nd-century breadbox technology. Do you 3D-print fresh bread every day? 
 You are familiar with omega clouds that blast anything rectangular (WTF?). Your previous space fleet was all rounded. Now you are going to see the senders of the clouds, and you deliberately build two ships that are rectangular, and Jack, skilled author that you are, I know you don't waste words, you made sure we got that they were rectangular. And the way you resolved that in the end was ... (view spoiler)[ YOU DIDN'T! (hide spoiler)] 
 You use the old blink, blink, 1+1=2 method of establishing communication. Time passes, and you have reached the grade 1 level of communication. 90 seconds later, you're discussing the immanence of post-Hegelian dimorphism as distinct from the sensibilities of Vogon poetry post-diaspora. Pfui. 
 All in all, the story rolls on smoothly, and it's a comfortable read, like an old pair of slippers, and you know why? It's because this book could have been written in 1965, when I first read stories like this one. 
 Then the ending which is memorable, but not in a good way. Summary: (view spoiler)[That looks dangerous - let's go closer! Aw, poor thing, its stuck! Sonofabitch, it's trying to grab us. Let's see ... it lied to us, so there's no way it will expect us to lie to it! There - we're free!! Shall we kill it? Shall we help it? Nah, let's just shake a finger at it, say ""BAD monster!"" and go home.(view spoiler)[ Because that's exactly why we built this spectacular spindizzy, and made the noble speeches about why we go to space. So we can (view spoiler)[fly a gazillion klicks, meet something, go ""Ewww,"" and fly home. (hide spoiler)] 
 That ending reeks of ""Ah, I've reached the page limit of my contract, I'll just wrap 'er up now."" (hide spoiler)] (hide spoiler)]"
3,"This was an interesting mix of the language and storytelling, parts were in a very lyrical romantic style and then we'd have this almost guttural modern-day speech. Also, the story was told in this jumpy disjointed way which I think served a point in highlighting the story it was telling, but I don't know if I would have enjoyed an entire novel of it. 
 It was different, and more romantic that was expecting, I liked it but didn't love it. 
 3.5"
5,"That was a really enjoyable read! I mean, I usually like Riordan's books, but this one definitely topped the first Magnus Chase book for me. This book seemed more distinctly Magnus to me, as opposed to feeling much like Percy by a different name. This book definitely fixed that issue. 
 I love the modernized nuances of the Norse gods, of course, as I've loved all the modern changes to the polytheistic worlds. But nothing so far has made me laugh quite as much as the Draugr utilizing Robert's Rules of Order before laying into the tresspassers into their grave. Here I am expecting Skyrim level monsters and they're too busy bickering over reading the minutes from the prior meetings to kill the intruding warriors. 
 Can I also get a hell yeah for the diversity? Alex being gender fluid, two deaf characters with multiple characters understanding and capable of speaking ASL/ESL, Amir getting some great character development, PLUS taking on more Muslim characters in the story was great. i hope we get to see more of Barry because he seemed like an excellent character. (I loved his mid-flight possession speech.) Alex being in the story and also having been homeless made for some really great awareness paragraphs regarding LGBT youths. For those that don't know or aren't fully aware of the extent of such problems, it's a great mention. (I'm kind of rooting for Alex and Magnus getting together, but that's just my personal opinion.) I also like the ways people deal with loss and how people deal with shitty family members in different ways. 
 I look forward to seeing how they resolve the Loki situation. Its definitely going to take a book or two to figure out how to deal with how this book ends."
4,"I really enjoyed this! There need to be more stories about girls with near-crippling bloodlust. 
 I think that the hallmark of a good action novel is when I don't mind suspending disbelief for the sake of getting on with the story. Yes, I know there is no way that someone with zero mounted combat experience is going to be able to get up on a horse and accurately fire a crossbow, but I don't care. It was still fun. 
 I'll admit that I was a little bit disappointed when (view spoiler)[the obvious love interest entered the story, but I grew to like Jack. Unfortunately it took Saba so long to stop being a hag around him that the book lost steam toward the end. (hide spoiler)] 
 I'm not sure that I enjoyed this enough to read the rest of the series, but I'm glad I got through this one. I liked it more than Divergent, but less than The Knife of Never Letting Go and The Hunger Games."
4,"Frustrating and often rage-inducing, but still a quick, engrossing read."
2,"A nice concept but it was a bit simple & childish for me. Not because it was YA (His Dark Materials being a great example of YA fiction that is neither simple nor childish) but because it was just not that great. 
 The dystopian society structure is really interesting, but once that idea is explained it's just got nothing."
0,Love the cover model and book cover... sigh Alex Minsky!! =)
5,"All at once, this is the most dense book in the series, yet the fastest paced. It has scenes that will make you cheer and cry with joy. It has scenes that are absolutely gut-wrenching, that will punch you in the groin and make you want to throw it in the fire and never look at it again. Nothing you knew about Westeros is safe. 
 Setting: 
 Set in Westeros and Essos, as its predecessors. New locales include lands further north of the Wall and the cities of Slaver's Bay in Essos. Also of note is the increasing presence of magic and fantastical elements in the world. 
 Plot: 
 Features numerous overlapping story arcs, told in strict third-person perspective:

 Whew. That's a lot of individual story arcs going on. This book is packed full of events, from beginning to end. 
 Characters: 
 Continues the practice of telling each chapter from a different character's perspective, this time featuring a total of ten different point of view characters (twelve if you count the prologue & epilogue.) Every p.o.v. character from A Clash of Kings returns except for Theon Greyjoy, and there are two new p.o.v. characters - both of whom have been featured in the background before. 
 It's amazing to watch the characters develop through this novel. Good guys become bad guys and bad guys become good guys. Villains show genius and heroes show ineptitude, and things become bleak without becoming hopeless. 
 Pacing: 
 My biggest complaint about the previous two volumes in the series was that they started slowly, but that was *not* the case with A Storm of Swords. This book starts off with a bang and manages to keep up an incredible pace all throughout its hefty weight of text. The entire book was tight and perfectly paced. 
 Notes: 
 We really start to see some magic populating the world in this book. This novel also concludes the opening trilogy of the series, which has a distinctly different narrative focus than the following volumes. 
 Spoiler Zone! 
 (view spoiler)[ 
 War in the North: 
 Wow, is Robb an idiot. I've been continually impressed by Robb throughout the first two books, because of his ability to kick ass on the battlefield, but he began to plant the seeds of his own destruction with the Theon decision in the previous volume. Now that he's lost control of his own land, we see him try to form a plan to take it back while slowly losing control of his own army. His mother betrays him out of misapplied desperation (since she thinks she's lost more than she actually has), which leads directly to him executing Lord Rickard Karstark and losing the support of the Karstark forces. 
 At the same time, Robb makes his biggest mistake out of a very Ned-like sense of honor when he hastily marries Jayne Westerling after deflowering her in a night of passion. Exactly how Ned's strict sense of honor spelled his doom in King's Landing, Robb's valuing of his personal honor over his commitment to the Freys spells his doom in the War of the Five Kings. When he tried to mend ties and arranged Edmure's wedding, I could sense something bad coming. I was especially frustrated when Robb locked up his agitated direwolf outside of the wedding. As a friend of mine is keen to remind people, ""When the world gives you magical wolves, don't ignore them."" 
 The Red Wedding made me put the book down for a few minutes, just so I could cope with what happened. I wasn't angry or shocked, but rather disturbed. It made me sad for the rest of the day. I didn't like Catelyn and had been liking Robb less and less as he began to squander his victories, but the effect of the Red Wedding was not simply their deaths, but the death of the entire northern army and war effort. Thanks to the betrayal of Roose Bolton, half of Robb's infantry were purposely trapped and killed at Duskendale, then Bolton and Walder Frey massacred the rest of the soldiers at the Twins. An entire army wiped out under the guise of safe conduct. 
 The hardest part to read was that image of Robb's body being desecrated with Grey Wind's head sewn atop it. Disturbing. 
 The Kingsroad: 
 I continued to love Arya throughout her arc, and really warmed up to Sandor Clegane as well. I was almost sad to see him die, but was elated when Arya got on the boat to Braavos. I've wanted her to go there since she met Jaqen H'ghar. 
 I was excited by the inclusion of more of the Lord of Light's power. We've seen Melisandre summon her shadow assassins before, but in this book we see her curse Joffrey Baratheon, Robb Stark, and Balon Grey, all of whom die shortly thereafter. In a world filled with more & more magic, that seems too precise to be coincidental. It makes me wonder just how much power and influence the Lord of Light possesses in the mortal world. 
 As an even more impressive testament to Rhyllor's power, we meet the drunken priest Thoros of Myr once more, only now he's bringing Belric Dondarrion back from the dead again and again. I loved that long callback to the first novel, where Ned Stark ordered Belric Dondarrion to bring Gregor Clegane to justice, only to never hear what happened with that...until now. 
 I was surprised to see Catelyn raised from the dead at the end, even though the Dondarrion events had provided foreshadowing for it. 
 I didn't like Jaime Lannister at first, but enjoyed Brienne of Tarth. The further the story went on, the more those positions flipped, to the point that I had warmed up to Jaime by the end, but didn't like Brienne as much as I thought I would. 
 Previously, all we've really seen of Jamie is this jealous lover + protective brother + great swordsmen. He's always been depicted from the view of the Starks, whose bias (especially Ned's) helps to paint him as a clear-cut villain. It was refreshing to see things from his point of view and discover how genuinely good of a character he is on the inside. Sure, he has serious flaws, but these are primarily related to his family. The secret, incestuous relationship he shares with his sister is his biggest fault, especially since he shows that he's completely willing to kill little kids in order to protect their affair. 
 However, he also reveals that he committed his grand act of betrayal in order to save innocent people from The Mad King's suicidal wrath. The fact that he was willing to sacrifice his personal honor and be branded as an oathbreaker in order to save the people of King's Landing shows me that he embodies a much more practical sort of honorability than the lawful stupid variety practiced by Ned Stark and his son, Robb. That decision of betrayal was something much more heroic than anything Ned Stark did in the first book, yet Ned constantly looked down on Jaime because of it. Ned didn't know the stakes, of course, but he also wasn't willing to learn them - to him, an oath was an oath, no matter the consequences and no matter the context. 
 King's Landing: 
 I was so glad to see Joffrey die in this series. I had been waiting to see if someone could rein him in, but he was so wild and arrogant that he was among the worst people the realm could have had in power. Now, with Tommen on the throne, things were situated for Tywin to be the real power behind the throne... 
 Until Tyrion ended that possibility. I was heartbroken when Oberyn Martell failed in his bid to win Tyrion's trial by combat, but then loved seeing Jaime and Varys free him and watching Tyrion enact his long-awaited vengeance on his father. The revelation just moments before that Tysha was not a prostitute, but in fact really was a peasant girl who fell for Tyrion, was such a game-changer. I felt like Tyrion overreacted with his lashing out at Jaime, but only in the sense that he lied about killing Joffrey. Tyrion is such a clever person and should know better than babble on like that. It's establishes that he sometimes talks too much, or doesn't know when to stop talking, but we've never seen anything near the level of rash outburst he gives in this scene. It only makes things worse for him, and he should have known better. That was probably the worst bit of dialogue in the entire book. 
 Seeing Shae betray Tyrion by bedding up with his father was a really confusing moment. Tywin was such an anti-whore man that I was wondering why Shae was there, and assumed it was an interrogation of some sort. It actually took me until the next book's other perspectives to realize that he was fucking Shae during the trial, which provides a hypocritical edge to Tywin's criticisms of his stunted son. 
 Tyrion's arc ends very openly, with him fleeing King's Landing. He's finally away from his family, where he's so long been the only hero in a house of villains. However, for the first time in his life, he won't be able to rely on the power and prestige that his last name has always brought him. 
 The Wall: 
 I loved how the prologue opened with plotting and intrigue, but then derailed all of that with a massive attack by the Others at the Fist of the First Men. That scene with the three horn calls was perfect. 
 I enjoyed the romance between Jon Snow and Ygritte, and was genuinely sad to see him abandon her to run back to the Wall. I felt like she cared for him so much that she might have went with him, especially if he forced her to, the wildling way. He didn't even try. Once that scene passed, I was sure she was going to die and I was not disappointed with the manner of her death. 
 The Battle at the Wall. Holy shit. I loved every minute of that. When Davos learned to read and came across the letter from the Night's Watch, I hoped he would convince Stannis to send help, but it seemed like way too good of a thing to happen when the writer is busy ripping apart the good guys in the other parts of the novel. When Stannis' knights showed up and flanked Mance Rayder's forces, routing them off of the Wall, I was genuinely thrilled. 
 Seeing the cowardly Samwell muster up the courage to suddenly become a politician was something to watch. He manipulates the voting so that Jon Snow is elected the Lord Commander, which suddenly shoves Jon into a position of leadership on the front line against the biggest threat to Westeros. 
 Bran's story finally picked up in this volume. He's been there throughout, but always as part of other people's arcs. Now that Winterfell is razed and he has Jojen Reed to teach him about these strange new shapeshifting abilities he's discovering, Bran finally has his own story to follow and heads for the Wall. 
 I'm very interested in the Coldhands character that guides Samwell to the wall and picks up Bran & company there, and what his true identity is. My immediate guess was Benjen Stark. Further reading has led me to think that this isn't the case. 
 Across the Narrow Sea: 
 After seeing Daenerys struggle through the last book, it was nice to see her get things together and start forming an army. The scene where she inspects the Unsullied soldiers, withholding the fact that she can speak High Valyrian, was brilliant. I loved the way that scene ended, with her giving up the dragon for all the soldiers, only to turn and order them to sack the city. ""A dragon is not a slave"" indeed. 
 Watching Daenerys expand her previous goodnatured attempts to rescue innocents into a war of freeing slaves seemed like a natural extension of her character. It made me feel like she would make a great queen, if she could ever actually make it onto the Iron Throne. The revelation that Arstan Whitebeard was actually Ser Barristan Selmy was excellent - once again, I love that long-distance callback to the first novel, where he was dismissed by Cersei. I also felt this was a twist that could only work in prose, since it would be obvious to a television viewer that it was the same person. The only reason it worked here was the limited third-person perspective - Daenerys didn't recognize him, so neither did the text. 
 Having enjoyed watching Daenerys sack three cities in a row and consistently grow her army, I was incredibly disappointed by her decision to stay in Mereen and ""learn how to be a queen."" That decision is terrible and makes very little sense, because the two places are so culturally different that the skill set it would take to rule Mereen is an entirely different skill set than the one required to rule the Seven Kingdoms. This moment really drives home the fact Daenerys is a young girl who can be naive, but I would've thought some of her more knowledgeable and experienced advisors would've done more to keep her from making such a mistake. 
 At the end of the day, I think her story moved so fast in this novel that it ended up progressing too quickly and outpacing the other arcs, forcing George R.R. Martin to stall her in the same place for a while and allow the other story threads to catch up.

3,"** spoiler alert ** 
 I feel pretty much the same way about this book as I do the others in the series, which is to say that I think they're fine, but nothing great, and the relationships, especially between Gemma and company, seem very forced. Some of that is missing in this book, because you don't see how the four came to be friends in the first place, but Felicity and Anne still undermine Gemma frequently and persist in falling back into their petty ways. 
 Also, the magic could have been explained a lot better. Libba Bray certainly created the semblance of rules surrounding the magic, but there was never a clear enough explanation for me to feel like it was anything more of a semblance. Especially at the end, when the essence of the Winterlands became very important, knowing more about the magic would have helped. 
 As for dynamic characters, Gemma seems pretty much unchanging. The most interesting character's change was Pippa, and then Circe. The problem with this is that Circe's changes made no sense. All of the sudden she's good? Or at least semi-good? And for what reason? It really didn't serve her cause that much. 
 And as for the Felicity/Pippa thing, I actually didn't have a problem with it. I saw it coming. I do think, however, that Libba Bray got a little heavy-handed with Felicity's feminism. There was a little too much talk of how women are oppressed."
4,"Once I got used to the writing (and it definitely took a few chapters to really get used to the flow of the writing), I thoroughly enjoyed this! 
 I loved the passion, the frustration, the back and forth, and the build up between Cal and Ray, they were incredibly sexy and wonderful together. I usually am not a fan of books that revolve around a big misunderstanding where they just won't *talk* to each other, but this worked for me. It definitely got better as the story developed and so if you can hang in there, I totally think it's worth it!"
4,"Things happened in this book and we meet a couple of characters that we knew from previous books, a very pleasant surprise. I liked how they wanted to fight fire with fire but in the end decided not to because they didn't want to become the same monster that they have been trying to get away from. Sunny seems to be growing up each book she is the one with the most character development I think. She is becoming quite the little spy, and sneaky too."
5,"I swear Percy Jackson could give Harry Potter a run for his money as King of Sass. With that being said, I loved this book. I think I laughed throughout most of it. I love the characters and the story just moves along so smoothly, even the fight scenes. Gotta make a mad dash to the library for the next books!"
3,"""in the wrong hands, power and magic can be dark, lethal, and consuming."" 
 T H O U G H T S: 
 an unnecessary but charmingly informative collection of details about characters like umbridge, slughorn, quirrell, peeves, and the previous ministers of magic, as well as places such as azkaban and topics like potions and cauldrons. the insight is lovely, but it also feels...wrong...in a way. the series is complete and the world is satisfied, yet the wizarding world keeps expanding and reopening again and again. each time, i wonder if it's better for the author's knowledge to stay a secret, something readers wonder and dream about, but never know. each time, i'm afraid of losing the magic spark alive in the original series. each time, i'm afraid it will become a cheap ploy for more money and fame. who knows? harry potter will live on not because of new spin-off series or novellas, but because of its original brilliance and beauty. it will last because it has been and will always be our home.

4,"I ended up really liking this book but it took me forever to get into this story. I was half way through before I got hooked and then I didn't want to put it down thus I was up until 3 am finishing. I'll read the sequel Beautiful Darkness when it comes out in October. 
 Content: There is mild language throughout the book and some innuendo but nothing graphic. Since it's paranormal there is talk of light and dark Casters, cursings, spells, claimings, etc.

5,"This book is ten different kinds of awesome. This is the deepest, most layered fantasy I have read in a while. The world created here hardly feels fictional. Every corner has been filled out, every detail comes alive. I felt less like I was reading about Goreddi than I was actually walking around it with Seraphina as my guide. I now know which saints to invoke when you're in mourning, which to invoke if you're shocked (St. Daan in a pan!), which carry their heads on a platter, and which are heretics. It's a world deeply entrenched in religion, prejudice, fear, tradition, and music. 
 Seraphina is a fantastic narrator. She's brilliant, casually dropping words like calefactive like it's no big deal. She's musically gifted, very observant, and intensely lonely. But she has a reason to be lonely. Her head is filled with numbers, music, and... a mind-garden full of grotesques. Yes, you read that right. It was so original. Confusing at first, but once I got a hold on it... holy smokes. I loved the grotesques she must tend to every night before she goes to sleep. Loud Lad and Fruit Bats and the sublimely creepy Jannoula. 
 Until yesterday, I thought there was an overabundance of dragons in contemporary fantasy. But Hartman's dragons are so unique that I just want more of them. In their true forms, Hartman's dragons are just as you'd imagine- big, scaly, winged fire breathers. But in order to facilitate peace between them and the humans, they've learned to take the forms of people. What they haven't learned is how to act like them. 
 Dragons are ruled by order. Emotions are dirty, nasty things that sully one's logic. This is both very frustrating for humans and very amusing for me. I ADORE the dragons. They are like Vulcans but even more socially awkward. I found myself giggling at their inability to perceive sarcasm and their complete indifference to people's feelings. 
 The human characters are just as vivid. Prince Lucian Skiggs made a worthy intellectual companion. Princess Glisselda, golden-haired second heir and Lucian's fiancee, deftly avoids being a cliche by possessing heart and a steely determination. 
 Seraphina's battle between her head and her heart, between her different halves, between her need to be ignored and her thirst to be loved, are the center of this book. She is uniquely disposed to ameliorate the deteriorating situation between the dragons and the humans. She's sharp-eyed and unruffled one moment, full of emotion the next. Seraphina was a very real character. 
 The plot is dense with world-building, but still so enjoyable. So much happens. The ending is appropriately climactic, the cliff-hanger not so hang-y, which I always appreciate. Devastating things happen, but happy things, too. And the LANGUAGE. This is one gorgeously written book. I found myself squirreling away a lot of Hartman's descriptors because they were just so wonderful. 
 I would recommend this book to everyone and anyone. Even if you don't like fantasy, give it a try. And if you do, it is a MUST READ.

5,"This book has made my favourite shelf. Why? Because I loved it! Who cares if I read it when I was 10? If I loved the book then and still remember it today, that has got to mean something - right? Fablehaven is memorable for me because it was the first series I actually got into and the first book I ever could say that I loved. 
 Fablehaven is about Seth and Kendra Sorenson, two seemingly normal kids who stay with their grandparents in their preserve while their parents are off on a cruise. The preserve, Fablehaven, is no ordinary place. And the people that inhabit it are no ordinary people. 
 Fablehaven is full of fairies and giants and demons. There is a lot of mystical creatures, magic and fairytale in this book. I loved the little ideas that Brandon Mull created like drinking milk from Violet the cow could grant the power to see the magic behind the ""veil"". 
 I thought it was a very good read. It is obviously targeted to the younger ages but I found that older readers could also enjoy the break from reality. I particulary liked the ending and that despite it being a series, if you want, the book could end right there and you would still feel satasfied. 
 The humour was exactly that. Hilarious. I loved the references to our lives (Frito Lay, Xbox ...) and found that in doing so, the reader felt more connected with the book. My favourite character is definitely Seth. Although he may be reckless, his heart is in the right place and he makes for great comic relief. 
 The imagery in this book is amazing. It is as if you are actually sucked into the book and it is playing out before your eyes. It had been 4 years since I revisited this book and I could still remember the fairy island and Midsummer night and all the chaos and monsters. I could remember the nightmare I had those years ago about a monster coming through the attic. And I awaited the naids, hoping they would drown a certain someone. If I can remember all that, then I can say with certaintity that this book leaves quite an impression. 
 On the romance scale, there is none. Well, yet anyways. If you venture into the other books (which I strongly suggest you do) then you will find romance as our characters grow and mature. But for now it is purely the story that matters, and I find that to be satasfying. 
 As a side note, I would like to mention that Brandon Mull is Canadian! We can write over here! 
 Overall, fanastic read and I am a proud owner of the complete series."
3,"After that cruel twist at the end of the previous volume, I had really high expectations for ""Snow White"". And then came along Oz... sigh. The first half of the book was not good at all. I liked Bufkin's adventures during the war, but he's always struck me as a very one note character, and this volume didn't help raise my opinion of him. The first story dragged on and on and on, which meant that by the time I got to Snow White's story, I was utterly bored. Still, that one was a bit of an improvement, although for a while there it seemed like this Snow wasn't the kick ass Snow White I knew I loved. I was glad to see it was all a plan, but still, it took a while. Also, this story left me wondering about something they told us in the past: (view spoiler)[isn't Snow White supposed to be pretty much impossible to kill because she's such a well loved character? Wasn't that how she survived getting shot by Goldilocks? What happened to that concept? (hide spoiler)] 
 Anyway, I guess the next volume will be the one to actually deal with what happened in ""Cubs in Toyland"". I, for one, can't wait to see what happens, especially seeing that the series is almost over."
3,"Really interesting start - hooked me but didn't keep me. Marion built his little world very nicely, and with humor, too... But the undoing of the plague & giving of answers really lacked for me. The Perry/R flashbacks & visions were interesting & I felt like they provided interesting nuggets of explanation & insight, unfortunately they were rarely built upon or tied into the main story. I liked R, I thought Julie was meh at best, and Nora grated on me. I wanted to like this book so very much...but I just couldn't. In the end, I just wanted it to be DONE."
4,"These books are like crack, once you start them you can't seem to put them down. Funny as hell I laugh and giggle all the way through them. I keep thinking okay the next book isn't going to be as good as the previous, but haven't been proven wrong yet."
5,"I've been reading a fair few YA paranormal novels recently though this was my first venture into angelic territory. Actually this may well spoil me for all others given Weatherly's confident writing style, her strong characterization and the compelling story-line. 
 Certainly a novel that will appeal to adult readers as well as YA. Also, to any who enjoy conspiracy/thriller themes mixed in with their paranormal components. It reminded me a little of the TV series 'Supernatural' (with a touch of 'Terminator'). Compelling stuff. The romantic aspects, while important, thankfully do not become the entire focus of the narrative. 
 With Willow Weatherly has created an appealing heroine: brave, self-contained and not prone to constant sighing over the male lead, Alex. I also appreciated that their relationship grew quite slowly and naturally when circumstances threw them together. 
 In terms of style, she shifts between the first-person narratives of Willow and Alex and then universal - often in the same chapter. I felt this was an indication of her confidence as a writer. I wasn't surprised to learn that she's also the co-author of an introduction to writing a plot-based, action-focused 'blockbuster'. 
 This was a library book but I've ordered my own copy as well as the next in the trilogy and can hardly wait to start reading."
0,"I was downright slap happy to get an ARC copy of this book, but it's taking a long time to get through it. It's sort of dry like a summer day in the desert; and every once in a while the wind picks up and carry me through a bout of pages. It's weird because this is a really great plot, but the tempo is not snappy enough. I'll save my final judgement until I finish. Thus far that's my view on it."
4,"Wow! The amazing descriptions, wonderful details, and beautiful imagery really added together to make a marvelous book. I loved the plot behind this book, and the friendship in this book; they are not best friends at first sight. Instead, they go through challenges and difficulties together throughout the book, and eventually they become best friends. A really brilliant read, that's colorful and imaginative. Truly wonderful, a good read for people of all ages. 
 3.75/5 stars!"

 Due to copy and paste, formatting has been lost. 
 In the end, I really have mixed thoughts about this one. I really liked it, but I'm not so sure that it was realistic, considering the circumstances. But leaving it with an open ending like that makes me happy, because for what it's worth, I truly enjoyed it! 
 The mystery element was very well done, and I kind of didn't see the ending coming. I mean, I had pondered what would happen if this particular thing occurred, but I had dismissed it as too far fetched and left it that. So yes, I was surprised. But also kind of disappointed. I was hoping for more drama-- more intrigue! But alas, we got an ending...and that's something, right? 
 Which brings us to another thing I want to talk about-- I've said it a bazillion times, I'm more of a character person than a plot person. But I do appreciate good plot, I truly do! James Patterson delivers us good plot (that's thick with lies and deceit) in Confessions of a Murder Suspect, but I'm not so sure that his characters were all that great! I mean, it gave the story a certain sheen and all, but...Tandy and her family really weren't spectacular. 
 I'm actually not sure how I feel about them. Tandy behaved like a robot for a long time, only giving us little glimpses of actual feeling once in a while, and I'll admit it... her family freaked me out. I mean, when you're telling a story about a six year old taking a machete to a teddy bear...uhm, that freaks me out. I do, however, like the descriptions of their house. It sounds really over-the-top and awesome. 
 Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I loved the narration! It was cool how Tandy kept phrasing things as if she was speaking (er...writing) to someone. I mean, check out that quote! It was also really refreshing to read about a protagonist who actually trusts her instincts. However, she was still an odd duck, but maybe in a good way? 
 All in all, I enjoyed Confessions of a Murder Suspect, and I'm definitely looking forward to the next book in the series. There are still some strings to be tied up! :] 
 I have some really bad secrets to share with someone, and it might as well be you-- a stranger, a reader of books, but most of all, a person who can't hurt me. ~ Pg. 1"
5,"I loved The Bone Season so much it has left me in a pretty annoying review slump. I keep putting the review off because I have an irrational fear that my review is going to suck, so to push myself out of my review slump, I'm going to give it a small, less detailed review and finally move on. 
 When I finally finished this book, I took the imitative to smack myself on the forehead for waiting so long to read The Bone Season. I put off reading this book for so long because I always fear I will hate those popular bestsellers that my friends in the book community always rave about. Instead, I wound up loving this and reading it in one night. 
 Paige aka ""Pale Dreamer"" is a mega-rare clairvoyant living in underground London because to live by-the-book in Scion London is to not be born clairvoyant. She's kidnapped by a race of unknown creatures whom see clairvoyants as a meal ticket and the perfect unwilling army to die for their cause. 
 I enjoyed Paige as a main character because she is strong and even though she is terrified to die, she is unwilling to give up the ""freedom"" of her underground life in London to become the otherworldly slavers' newest punching bag. Most clairvoyants forced to live in Oxford just give in to the fact that they are enslaved to the Rephaim and don't bother to fight their fate, but Paige is not satisfied with the protection her trainer Warden gives her as Consort to the ruler of the Rephaim. 
 Like my friend Tika @ fANGIRL confessions and other bloggers have stated, The Bone Season doesn't need to come with an instruction manual, because everything new about this fantasy world can be learned through context clues (and the glossary at the back of the book if necessary, but it wasn't for me). I appreciate that the author didn't bother to make up words in an attempt at creating an original fantasy novel - or make up the spelling of words (major pet peeve right there) - because the extraordinary world building in The Bone Season does the job all on its own. :) 
 Did you enjoy my review? If so, please consider giving it a thumbs up on Amazon *HERE* Thank you for all you do!

2,"I picked this one up because I had never read anything by Kenyon and in my attempt to read great Paranormal Romance post-BDB series, her name kept coming up alongside the Dark Hunter series. So seeing that this one was first I went for it. And let me tell you, after reading it? I avoided everything Kenyon. 
 Let me explain. I like my PR heroes badass and tortured. For those that get the BDB reference, I'm a total Z girl. Not to say that I don't love the good time guys with a shady past, because believe me, I have a very serious thing going with Rhage as well. So that being said, Julian was the only reason I attempted to finish this book. There was no badass. It was cheese romance at Velveeta's finest. I skimmed it towards the end. Yes, SKIMMED. I don't do that. I persevere to the end with books, but I just couldn't. I'm not a huge Greek mythology person, and that seemed to be the extent of badassness for this one. And Grace? Oh, good lord. Her aversion to sex over that guy in college? REALLY? You screwed a douche bag. It happens to the best of us sweetheart, the fact that you're a psychologist and STILL hung up on that guy who was a dick after you boned him? I do not understand you. Not one bit. 
 So laying all that on the table, I just couldn't understand the appeal. It was written with a soft hand, with a female lead that made no sense to me, and a tortured hero who had the makings of something cool, but just didn't hit it home for me. The whole sex slave in the book thing was just a little over the top for my taste. A little silly, if you will. So once I put this one down I just didn't see where the Dark Hunter awesomeness was going to come in, but that's for another day when I finally picked up the next one. Which, yes, I finally did."
3,"This wasn't a surprise coming from me. I liked, but didn't love, Three Dark Crowns last year, and this book felt much the same. There were parts I enjoyed, for sure, but overall this series isn't for me. 
 Also, if it's been a full year since you've finished Three Dark Crowns, I recommend refreshing yourself on some of the finer plot points and characters because it sure did take me a while to figure out who everyone was!"
5,"When I picked up this trilogy, I didn't expect I'd love it this much. After all, it was yet another YA book with a sixteen-year-old girl who discovers she has special powers, then has to learn about them under the guidance of a reluctant and at first very rude young man her own age who later (view spoiler)[ ends up falling in love with her - and she with him, of course. (hide spoiler)] (Actually, I don't think that's really a spoiler, but let's be careful, shall we?) 
 Still, there is something about Ruby Red that drew me in. Gwyneth is actually a very smart heroine, which is a nice change. Throughout the entire story, I don't think I've even once half-shouted at the book 'No, you stupid cow, what the heck are you doing THAT for?!'. (And trust me, that often happens to me when I'm reading this genre.) She's smart, she's generally cautious but not so much so that she's boring, and she doesn't unnecessarily keep secrets from the people closest to her. I loved her. (view spoiler)[ Even if she did fall in love with Gideon de Villiers. (hide spoiler)] 
 I also loved Lesley, Gwyneth's best friend; her mum, who is so protective and helpful without being patronising - she reminded me a lot of my own mum, actually; and lots of the other characters making an appearance in this first book. I'm very eager to continue reading about them in Sapphire Blue."
2,"When I was struggling to get through the first four chapters, I should have just given up. I'm not a quitter though. I continued with it but I disliked all of it. The characters were shallow and poorly developed. I didn't care what happened to any of them and I was just trying to finish the book. The ""love"" story left me feeling sad because of how badly it was written. There wasn't much of a plot and as I got to the end, I felt like the author didn't know how to finish it. There were multiple endings and the epilogue didn't help. Don't expect this book to be like Water for Elephants or you will be sorely disappointed."
3,"I enjoyed Crave, but I was a little frustrated with the plot and wanted more from Archer and Ivy's romance. There wasn't really much to the plot as it focused almost exclusively on Archer & Ivy and I would have loved to be more engaged in an overall story line. 
 Archer & Ivy had a very promising start to the novel. They bicker a lot, but its clear that its because there is something more to their relationship that they need to explore. They fall into bed pretty quickly, which is fine, but a good chunk of their scenes involved sex and I just didn't really believe in their love. I wanted to, but we read more about them screwing then seeing them interact on an intellectual level. 
 Since the whole plot is devoted to Archer and Ivy's feelings for each other (and how they express that physically), there is really no action, adventure, or mystery to speak of. It is a short, quick read that can be finished in a couple of hours when you're in the mood for something light and fluffy. 
 While I adore love stories, Crave had too much physical intimacy without allowing the reader to really feel the sparks between Archer & Ivy. It was hard to root for them as a couple since we see more intimate moments than heartfelt ones. The pacing, however, is good and I did enjoy reading it. I recommend it when you're in the mood for something light and quick as it is a fairly short story and can be read in just a few hours."

4,"The reason why I feel I need to write a review for this book is that I think many people who have read it, cannot identify with the characters, and therefore find it ""weird"", or the characters ""flat"". 
 Personally, I can identify with the characters so much that it is almost painful. Just one moment in your life changes everything, you are broken and you cannot ever heal. And it was not even (entirely) your fault. 
 I am sick of characters who pretend to be different, but turn out to be just what everyone in the world seems to be feeling like. And in the end, they are really cool, and they tell us that we are really cool. And yes, our lives are actually quite good. 
 But no, there are people like Mattia and Alice, and they are not cool, they are really different, not just in the pretending way, the way everyone feels they are different from the world. They are ill, they are broken, they are not like you. 
 The reason why I rated this book with only 4 stars and not 5, is (view spoiler)[that I needed another ending. Just this once. Authors seem to think that sad endings are more realistic, or more artful. But I wish just for once, doomed people would get a happy ending. (hide spoiler)]"
3,"Aw, man. 
 It's fairly common knowledge, I think, that one of my favorite books of all time is Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe. I adore that book. This book isn't that book, and that's fine, but it is still a little sad that I didn't fall in love with Saenz's newest offering. 
 The best thing about this book is the relationship that Sal has with his father, Vicente, and the actual character of Vicente as a whole. I love him. He is a single, gay father, who adopted Sal when his birth mother passed away from cancer. He has a heart of gold and is the shining light of this novel. 
 There were several things that hindered my enjoyment of this book. They are, in no particular order: Sal's best friend/sister, Sam; some phrasing/dialogue; and repetitive plot points. Three characters die in this story. They are all women, and they all ""belong"" to one of the the three friends. I was overwhelmed. Sam's character gave me whiplash. At times, I thought she was smart and kind and funny, other times, she was disrespectful, invasive, and rude. Yeah, yeah, teenagers are like that, whatever. I'm on the fence with how I feel about her as a total character. I enjoyed Fito a lot better. 
 There were a lot of sentences or descriptions that I would read and then have to step back and be like, ""wait, did I just read that?"" From a flippant use of ""schizophrenic,"" to numerous instances of statements like (paraphrased) ""you really are gay"" (when Fito helps Sam pick out a dress), ""for a gay guy, my dad is pretty straight,"" and other similar ideas. Why was this necessary? This wasn't the writing that I remembered loving so much in other books. 
 Overall, I just don't know. I'm disappointed I didn't fall in love with this book. It was a fast read, despite being long, and there were moments when I thought ""yes, this is it, this is what I love,"" but those moments never really stuck. All I can say is, bless Vicente. He's amazing."
5,"It's hard to express how delighted I am with this book. 
 Now, I'm a sucker for a good Twelve Dancing Princesses story, but this one went above and beyond. I loved how well-rounded the cast was, and the realism of the setting. 
 The setting was so well done, you have no idea. Haskell actually researched medieval (Polish!) clothing and food and politics instead of having Ye Olde Silk Dresses And Mutton. It was such a vivid book, grounded in daily life, in a way fantasy rarely is. Our protagonist is an herbalist, but instead of just vaguely dispensing willowbark and made-up plants, she does all the things an herbalist actually does! It was a joy to watch her at work. 
 The magic was delightful as well, from the fern cap of invisibility to her attempts to break a curse with cabbage leaves. Definitely worth a read."

 Synopsis: 
 Sometimes in life, in order to move forward you must face the past... 
 #1 New York Times bestselling author Colleen Hoover held readers spellbound with her novel Hopeless, the story of what happened when a troubled girl named Sky encountered a long-lost childhood friend, Dean Holder. With Holder's help, Sky uncovered shocking family secrets and came to terms with memories and emotions that had left deep scars. 
 Hopeless was Sky's story. Now, in Losing Hope, we finally learn the truth about Dean Holder. 
 Haunted by the little girl he couldn't save from imminent danger, Holder's life has been overshadowed by feelings of guilt and remorse. He has never stopped searching for her, believing that finding her would bring him the peace he needs to move on. However, Holder could not have anticipated that he would be faced with even greater pain the moment they reconnect. 
 In Losing Hope, Holder reveals the way in which the events of Sky's youth affected him and his family, leading him to seek his own redemption in the act of saving her. But it is only in loving Sky that he can finally begin to heal himself. 
 My Review: 
 I have to start out with the fact that I loved Colleen Hoover's Hopeless, so I had extremely high hopes for Losing Hope and drove myself nuts with anticipation waiting anxiously for the day I could finally get my hands on a copy of this book! Hopeless was certainly a tough act to follow! I've never read a second book, from a different person's point of view, so I have to admit that I was quite skeptical about reading this book, and enjoying it as much as I did the first one, but boy was I wrong! It seemed to help me that much more that I already knew the background of the story, and seemed to be able to read more efficiently and thoroughly because of that fact! I was also able to enjoy what I was reading a little easier than a book you're reading for the first time! 
 Dean ""Holder"" was such an amazing character in Hopeless that simply left me feeling speechless and hopeless for days after finishing it, so I couldn't wait to get more of Holder! I found myself highlight favorite quotes from holder every few pages! He's just so wise and intricate and deep and intense and even though I loved Sky, I really wanted to delve into Holder's world and thoughts! He left me just as smitten if not more the second time around! 
 The story is so gut-wrenching but believable! Again, I must use the word intense, because that seems to be the only appropriate adjective to describe both Holder and the story. The story flowed so smoothly and was so well written that I easily lost myself within the story. I started the book when I went to bed, and here I found myself at 2 am, already 42% into the book, forcing myself to stop reading because I HAD to go to sleep!! It was so hard to put down the book once you started, and I LOVE that about Colleen Hoover's books! She has such an awesome ability to capture the true essence of what a reader wants and ensconce them in her writing! 
 After reading Hopeless, it left me reeling for days! Hopeless was all that consumed my thoughts and Losing Hope is no different! Both books left me feeling the roller coaster of emotions that the characters were feeling at the time: devastation (which Holder shares his personal thoughts of the meaning throughout!), grief, pain, sadness, chemisty, contentment, fulfillment, true love. I couldn't help but feeling breathless, my heart aching, leaving me gasping for breath while throughout the entire book. I have never in my life read another story from another author that has made me personally feel so emotional and invested as Colleen Hoover has been able to do in not one, but TWO books!! 
 There are not enough words or adjectives in the English vocabulary that can do this book and this author justice, but I will try with unbelievable phenomenal best two books that I have EVER read! It does leave me wanting more, more of the future for Sky and Holder! At the end of Hopeless, all I could feel was Hopeless. Now at the end of Losing Hope, I feel breathless, still speechless, but not so hopeless! It left me with my own little ray of Hope! I certainly hope this is not the end of Sky and Dean and can't wait to see more out of Colleen Hoover and hope that this series takes her to the top, because that is where she belongs!

3,"I enjoyed this series. It was lighthearted, funny in some parts, sometimes romantic, mysterious and sometimes exciting. It was good but not great. I appreciated the clean romance, though there was some sexual innuendo thrown in all three books. I enjoyed the story and the questions the plot built in the first two books that weren't answered immediately until the third book. I enjoyed the characters of Lesley, James and Madame Rossini, but I didn't form any sort of attachment with anyone. And the whole time travel lore and mechanics, I just went with it and tried not to think about it too much. 
 So, I thought the 3rd book reached the climax halfway through and then the plot fell off a cliff...literally, we finally get to an exciting moment in the series where a prophecy comes true and then afterwards we're stuck with multiple scenes that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot but slow it down. All of that built up excitement and climax gone with the wind. And then the ending...I like to think of it as an ending that doesn't finish the story. (view spoiler)[does anyone else find it odd that the whole series is pretty much built on Gwen and Gideon's romance and there at the end we don't even see them together??? (hide spoiler)] 
 I also find that I still have some expectations that didn't see light, along with some unanswered questions: 
 1-(view spoiler)[I might have missed this point entirely but how were Lucy and Paul able to stay in the past without the chronograph? Wouldn't they have had continued uncontrollable time travel because of the nature that they were still alive??? 
 2-I fully expected Mr. Marley to do well, more in the series than he did. Kerstin Gier certainly wrote his character in a way that I expected him to take revenge om all of his frustrations caused by the other characters. 
 3-What happened to all Guardians after the chronograph was closed? Is there still a need to elapse? 
 4-Mr. George...I really thought he'd be at the big scene of the books somehow, but all you got where little hints that he knew to help Gwen and Gideon along. Let down. 
 5-I wasn't exaclty fond of Gwen. She was ok but next to Serena from Sailor Moon, I'd nickname her one of the biggest cry babies ever. The girl cried about everything! 
 6-I thought Grace would've played a bigger part in the series. What happened to her and Faulk anyways? (hide spoiler)]"
3,"So I heard so many great things about Gayle Forman but never read any of her books. 
 The writing was beautiful and I loved the family dynamic but my hopes was way up and in the end the book wasn't what I expected it to be. 
 If you enjoy good writing and heartbreaking stories, this is the perfect book for you."
4,"My review is up today at http://fictionvixen.com/review-the-pr... 
 Emma wants a baby. Badly. After the death of her fiance and mother, and with her biological clock ticking, she wants to have a baby to fill the void in her life. When one of her best friends tells her he won't be playing the role of sperm donor, she feels like she has struck out. Aidan Fitzgerald is at the right place, at apparently the right time. When he comes upon what he thinks is a lover's quarrel, he is set straight by Connor, Emma's best friend, on what the situation actually is. Aidan is a player, the company bad boy, who is known for his sex God, love them and leave them ways. When he offers Emma a proposition, that he will be her sperm donor, but only if they conceive it naturally, she is shocked. 
 Honestly, when I started The Proposition I thought this was going to be a cheesy storyline. I really had no idea how in the world this author was going to make this believable to me. But... I got sucked into the story, and roughly four hours after I picked this book up, I finished it. Emma at first seems so sad, and I really didn't connect to her good girl, desperate to have a baby character. It took me a couple of chapters, and her telling Aidan about her life to make me understand why she so badly needed to create a family for herself. She and Aidan do make a deal, and I was surprised at how amusing their negotiations were: 
 ""I can assure you I'm clean, but I'll be happy to submit."" 
 ""Thank you."" Emma passed a manila folder over to him. ""I also had my lawyer draw this up."" 
 He eyed it before bringing his gaze back to hers. ""A contract, huh?"" He leaned back in his chair and flipped the folder open. ""Is this one of those contracts like in that kinky book where we outline what we're willing to do or not to do during sex? Like our hard limits and safe words?"" 
 Emma felt a wildfire of embarrassment spreading through her cheeks. ""Absolutely not."" 
 Aidan laughed. ""Glad to hear it. Just so you know, I don't go in for freaky shit like whips and chains."" 
 Emma and Aidan embark on a baby making journey, and their relationship quickly turns from just sex to something that neither is prepared for, something much more intense. Aidan was a surprise, someone who I thought was going to be the classic jerk turned out to be a much deeper, more complex character. He and Emma have some seriously hot chemistry. Seriously hot. Desk sex, ride me like a cowgirl sex, shower sex, these two burn up the pages, but his desire to make their interactions together special and Emma feel at ease is what really kept me glued to the page. Regardless of how they came together initially, they fall into a very sweet relationship. I almost didn't want Emma to get pregnant, I wanted to stretch out as long as possible the ""trying to get pregnant scenes"". Aidan, despite his protests, wants to be a fixture in Emma's life. She is sweet, strong, funny and sexy. A small town girl, who values family and friends. Aidan seems to have been raised by a loving, secure family. When he starts to freak out at the end of the book I still don't understand why, and he does freak out. The last 5% of the book made me so angry at him I wanted to reach into the book and wring his neck, I was sick to my stomach. I was so afraid he would do something that I as a reader wouldn't be able to forgive him for. He comes close, but I think he came to realize how bad he was messing up at the end. Thank the Lord he can fix this. 
 Yes, there is a cliffhanger. It seems like every book I pick up now days has a hook to make you want to read book two. After reading the end I about died when I found out the next book The Proposal won't be out until January. I have no idea how I'm going to wait until the new year to find out how Aidan repairs his relationship with Emma. I hope she makes him grovel and beg, like hardcore groveling and begging. They make a wonderful couple, but Aidan needs to figure out what it is about himself that made him sabotage his own happiness. 
 The Proposition was a mixture of funny, sweet, tender and sexy. The dialogue is extremely well written and the story flows so well you would have no idea that this was a debut by Ms. Ashley. She's got me good and hooked, I will definitely be picking up the next book in January. Final Grade: A 
 Favorite Quote: 
 Aidan took Emma's hand and brought it between them. ""Touch yourself,"" he instructed. Embarrassment filled her at this request. When she started to jerk her hand away, Aidan shook his head. ""If you won't touch yourself, then touch me... touch us."""
2,"It's not a good sign when the my first thoughts on completing a novel are ""I'm glad I purchased this trilogy as a single book"". Authority is book two in the Southern Reach trilogy, with a compilation of all three available under the title Area-X. 
 Like the first book in the series, Annihilation, for the most part I enjoyed the storytelling here. In particular I appreciated that VanderMeer takes a very different approach this time around with a new main character, a more conventional writing style, and an almost spy/thriller feel as opposed to the journal based, horror story of Annihilation. 
 Unfortunately the one element which has carried over from Annihilation is the painful lack of answers regarding the mysteries in the book. By the end of the book I felt like I knew nothing new about area-x, and while I appreciate leaving some things up to the reader, in this case I feel like the reader is owed a good explanation on exactly what is going on here. 
 Hopefully this closure will finally come in the third book as I will be very disappointed otherwise."
5,"I NEED MORE, THIS WAS AMAZEBALLS"
2,"DNF at 65% 
 But I know the end so I basically know everything that matters."
4,"Another great novella in this urban fantasy series. 
 I have already read and enjoyed the previous stories in this series. I love Ms Bellett's writing style; the way she builds her characters, the world her tales are set in and the way the plot develops. 
 As with every great book written as part of an ongoing series, many of the mysteries and questions are satisfactorily concluded by the end of his book, while other far reaching story arcs are grown within these pages but left to be explored in later books. 
 The only reason this novella missed out on a 5th star was the handful of editing/proofreading error that occurred. These simple ""predicative text"" mistakes took the edge off for me."
4,"The Quiet Gentleman is an interesting Heyer as its more of a mystery than a romance. There is an element of romance and happy endings for all the couples but there's a slight gothic element. Gervase returns to a home that didn't welcome as the new Earl and someone starts making attempts on his life. He's a fascinating character; quiet but sure of himself. I was reminded of some of Mary Balogh's characters. This is a book I'd recommend to those who know Heyer but also those who enjoy cozy mysteries. All the elements that make a Christie work are here; a feeling of place, well drawn characters and an element of suspense and many red herrings."

4,"This was a fairly standard fantasy story. It was decent without being anything special. 
 The Emperor has just been assassinated and this book follows the story of his three children as they seek to avoid the same fate. All three of the siblings are in different locations. The eldest, Adare, remained at court with her father and learned the ways of government. The youngest sibling, Kaden, is the heir to the throne and is training in a far flung monastery. The middle sibling, Valyn, is training to be a warrior with the legendary Kettral. All three were likable enough characters. 
 I liked Valyn's story the most. The Kettral training was interesting and the secondary characters were the most developed. Kaden's story was fairly interesting. Mainly because it eventually lead to us learning who was behind the plot to kill the Imperial family. The mythical, and not human, Csestriim. Adare seemed likable enough. We spent the least amount of time with her. She was focused on discovering who assassinated her father. 
 Despite having a few flaws this book recovered from a slow start to become a fun read. The Csestriim were suitably creepy and villainous, and the various hints of magic we glimpsed were pretty cool. 
 Rating: 4 stars. I'm being kind as the ending was quite good. 
 Audio Note: Simon Vance is a competent narrator, but he will never be a favorite of mine."

 Reviewing Dracula in this twilight age of loin-thrustingly pert young vampettes and vamparistas is like extolling the sexual allure of Clara Bow and Jean Harlow. 
 Dracula was the first ""grown up"" book I ever read. Hey, 12 year old PB, good choice! It made my pulse pound and my skin horripilated madly. But I do not think this would happen to a modern reader. Poor old recycled Dracula, rewritten, cartooned, parodied, Buffyfied, sliced, diced, crimped, carved, and ripped off in every one of a million ways, undead you were and undead you still are, if only as a Halloween costume and a footnote to an essay about Stephanie Meyer. 
 Given all of that, and given the high Victorian never use one word where a bucketful will do style of Mr Stoker, I still think it's worth five of my stars. It seethes with that wonderful sexual hysteria the Victorians loved writing about, from Wuthering Heights to Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. They couldn't mention anything directly so they did their best with linguistic nodding and winking, and much mention of purity, and chasteness and its opposite unchasteness. Bosoms were okay, anything beneath waist level was absolutely not, until you got to shapely ankles and well-turned feet. So you can see they were gagging for it, and the writers were ferociously finding metaphors for writing about sex; and Bram Stoker found vampires. The strong sick pall of sexual dread which suffuses Dracula like a London pea-souper is seduction. This is what Stoker wants to write about - seduction and sexual enslavement, or, why do good girls fall for such very bad men? The Count is the embodiment of all seducers. He comes around at night and he gets into your fiance's bedchamber, so naturally you have to drive a big phallus right through his heart. I get that. Bram Stoker is practically frothing about all of this. 
 Bram Stoker invents most of the trappings of vampires right here and throws in a handful of the most outrageous scenes (three beautiful young female vampires in the dead of night overheard squabbling about who should get the baby they have got in the bag they're holding up; three men all giving one woman a blood transfusion using only a rubber hose; the Count scrabbling up a castle wall as fast as a man could run, all great stuff). 
 I say read Bram Stoker, read Let the Right One In, and step delicately around Twilight."
2,"Okay, I really did not enjoy this book. At the beginning, I was sure I would. Up until Lucy goaded those boys after Jude told her multiple times to get her ass back in the house. At that moment, I decided I didn't like Lucy. She didn't deserve what happened to her as a result of said goading, but that was just dumb and I never got past that. Then there were other moments that just made it impossible for me to like her. I did feel the need to stick up for her a couple of times, so she wasn't all bad. 
 Jude, I liked for a while longer, but his constant anger issues and need to beat people up reminded me of Travis from Beautiful Disaster and considering I didn't much care him, it's no surprise that Jude ended up not doing it for me. Their whole relationship reminded me of the dysfunctional relationship in Beautiful Disaster with some major plot differences, but the feel of the relationship was the same and I just couldn't connect. 
 I think the only person I liked in the book was Holly. 
 I almost forgot. (view spoiler)[I am upset that no one turned in that rapist Sawyer. Yeah, he's the City's Son and all, but he just gets away with it. Sure Jude and Holly take a bit of childish revenge, but in the grand scheme of things, he got off way too lightly. Then Jude and Lucy move to the other side of the country leaving this dude to just prey on someone else now that Jude isn't around to keep him in line. He should be punished. I hate that he wasn't.

 I really wanted to like this, but it just wasn't for me."

4,"Why I picked it up: November read for my teen book group at work. I had read it before, but it had been a while, so I needed to refresh my memory. 
 Twelve-year-old Moose Flanagan moves to Alcatraz in January 1935 because his dad gets a job there. Moose misses his friends and none of the other kids on the island play baseball, but the warden's daughter Piper had a great scheme that she needs help with: getting the kids at school (off the island) to pay for the privilege of getting their laundry done by the Alcatraz convicts, including the famous Al Capone. 
 I enjoyed this just as much on the second go-round. Natalie, Moose's ""younger"" sister who would likely be diagnosed with Autism today, is a fantastic character and Moose's feelings toward his sister and his resentment toward his parents for having to take care of her after school are very realistic. My favorite scene is when the Alcatraz kids are all together and one of them sets aside rocks that Natalie might want. Moose realizes that the kid has figured out what kind she likes. And the other kids ask for help with numbers, because they know she is good at it. Natalie is pretty much accepted and included, and Moose didn't really have to do anything. 
 This book also contains one of the better author's notes I've read. She tells you exactly what is true to the time period and what she created. A great historical fiction read and a good family story."
5,"Review posted here. 
 As I've said before, I was part of the Gallagher Girls since almost the very beginning. I can't even remember when I first read LYKY, but I remember picking it up because it had a cute cover, an intriguing title, and an even more interesting description. I remember loving it. I remember obsessively checking Ally Carter's website daily to make sure I wasn't missing out on any GG news. I remember being so excited about this series and sharing it with my mom. I don't remember it becoming a massive hit, but then suddenly, I realized I wasn't the only one waiting anxiously for each new installment of the adventures of Cammie, Bex, Liz, and Macey. Suddenly, I was part of something bigger, something that even the word fandom can't quite encapsulate. I was a part of the real Gallagher Girls. I was part of a family of readers who could imagine perfectly fitting into a world of spies, lies, and danger. That's why this review is pretty hard to write. How do you say goodbye to something that means so much to so many? How do you say properly critique something when you know whatever you say will be considered aimless gushing? The answer, I suppose is that you don't. You don't say goodbye. You don't give a proper critique of the technical aspects. You gush. You cry a little. You laugh. And you say, see you on your next adventure. 
 I think one of the reasons the Gallagher Girls series is such a hit is that Cammie is one of the best narrators a book could have. Sure, as this is in first person, we know Cammie's story will be a little unreliable, as all first person narration is. However, when the narrator is also a spy-in-training and is actually recording every event, every conversation for use in Official Government Documents, you trust her a little bit more. Cammie is the chameleon. She blends in the background in every mission (or she's better than the rest, at least). Well, she's also a chameleon for the fact that she's one of the most relatable characters I've ever read in ya. Cammie's story is so diverse and rich in experience that I dare you to find someone who doesn't share something with her, from the death of her father; to her feelings of invisibility and later, inadequacy and insanity; to her guilt, fear, and anger of both the future and the past; to her connection with her mom and aunt; her friendships; her romantic relationships... I could go on, but I think that's a good list. Cammie will always be someone I feel like I can go to when I'm having a problem because I feel like she and her three supporting musketeers have solved just about every problem a girl can possibly have. And if not, they certainly have gifted me with the tools to solve my problems. 
 One of the best things about Cammie through the series has been her remarkable ability to change and adapt, which is another aspect of her chameleon-ness. With long series, I think it can be hard to have your characters change realistically without intense reader backlash. We always love the characters in the first book, but sometimes, it's hard for a reader to accept the changes an author creates in sequels. Not in this case. Cammie's been through the ringer, emotionally, physically, mentally. By United We Spy, she's incredibly different from the innocent young girl we met in LYKY; however, she's also the same in many ways, a feat I attribute to her extraordinary strength of character. Even when at her most vulnerable and broken, she's strong. I find Cammie one of the most remarkably admirable characters in any book of any genre. 
 Next, we have Cammie's stalwart roommates, teammates, cheerleaders, and minions: Bex, Liz, and Macey. A tougher and more loyal group of sidekicks there never was, and the amazing thing is that I actually feel pretty guilty calling them Cammie's sidekicks because each girl goes through her own intense development and trials throughout the series. They're not just yes-girls. They're their own main character in their own story that Ally for whatever reason chose not to write. But the fact that ""Double Crossed"" exists and that each girl had her moment[s] in the series proves they're leading ladies in their own right (darn right I stole that concept from The Holiday!). Like Cammie, each of the three has moments of fragility intertwined with moments of hardiness. There are times in these books when I wondered if one of the girls would fall prey to jealousy or weakness or fear. I wondered if one of them would ever give up on Cammie, give up on the Gallagher Girls. There are occasions when I could see them deciding it was too much effort. Macey and Liz, especially, had tastes of life outside of spying, and I wondered if they would ever just quit. They did not. They are Gallagher Girls. They stuck with it to the end because their stubbornness and their love for one another just wouldn't let them give up. If there's anything I admire in a person, fictional or otherwise, it is loyalty. The Gallagher Girls display that in spades. 
 Next, there is Zach, the mysterious guy who seemed just like another guy in CMH. Since it seemed like Josh would not be around, I expected Zach to likewise be a one-and-done. Ally really surprised me with that one. I had no idea Zach would be so very central to the arc of the entire series. Zach was always frustrating to me because like Cammie, I had a difficult time figuring him out. Even when I wanted to trust him, to love him wholly, there was always something holding me back. I guess that's a spy for you. I really do have to credit Ally with all the remarkable depth she gave to the story with Zach. You know you've got a well-written character when, despite an inability to trust him and his intentions, you want to trust him. With Zach, I wanted to throttle him just as many times as I wanted him to rip off his shirt. My favorite moments of the series are often the scenes with Cammie and Zach, but not because of the kissing (which, I admit, was spectacular. I mean, there's a scene in UWS that just took my breath away!). It was because Cammie became something more with Zach. She had to be stronger, smarter, more cautious, but she also was more human and she inspired that in Zach as well. Watching them grow together both as a couple and as spies and as people was glorious. 
 The supporting cast was all incredible as well. Cammie's mom, Aunt Abby, Mr. Solomon, Agent Townsend, Mrs. Buckingham, Madame Dabney, Mr. Smith, Courtney Bauer, Tina, etc. These characters never seemed like props. They were real people, and each served a special and distinct purpose. I am sad that like a lot of the supporting characters in Harry Potter, many were not even seen in the final book, but then, by that time, Cammie was past the point of needing so much backup. Still, I will always cherish those initial outings of the sophomore CoveOps class and the gossipy meals in the Grand Hall with all the creme brulee. 
 Finally, the plot. LYKY was so much more a cute contemporary romance than the later books. We got the background, we met many of the players, the stage was set. Little by little, Ally increased the pace with each installment until the books became one high-stakes spy game with romance on the side. I think United We Spy was an appropriate finale. It answered all my questions and gave me the resolution I'd been craving. I don't feel disappointed. I feel complete. I feel like Ally accomplished everything I wanted her to and more while leaving an open enough ending that I know at least some of the Gallagher Girls are moving on in one way or another. I say open because it doesn't spell out the future in precise detail. That said, will Ally go back to this extraordinary spy world? Perhaps. I hope she might, one day, many many years from now. But do I honestly think she will? It's hard to say. The story of Cammie and her friends is almost certainly at an end, and I'm okay with that. But if a character from GG popped up in a future Heist Society or Embassy Row adventure, I'd be okay with that too. 
 I know this was kind of long and ramble-y, but honestly, this wasn't entirely for you. Sorry, guys. This was just what I need for closure for a series that I've been intimately acquainted with for a long, long time. Honestly, I really don't know what I'm going to do. I haven't felt slightly lost like this at the conclusion of a series since I finished Harry Potter. I'm not sure I'll ever have a series where I feel like this again. 
 So Ally, if you read this, thank you. This series has meant so much to me. Thank you for your incredible writing. Thank you for your silly yet totally believable names for gadgets and tactics and fighting moves. Thank you for finally writing a scene in which Zach is wearing a towel and nothing else. Thank you for sharing Cammie and the crew with me, with all of us Gallagher Girls. You crafted a phenomenal tale about a group of girls in spy school who do remarkable things, but for the record, I know the truth. You are the true Gallagher Girl, and you have done the most remarkable thing of all: you made us believe."
3,"I just finished this story and I actually quite liked it. I have to say however that I expected more from it. It was not as good as I thought it would be, so that was a disappointment. 
 I liked the feeling of mystery that I got and I definitely wanted to know what would happen with every passing paragraph, but it just didn't tell me everything I had hoped to find out. I think this is purely because of the narrator. He or she doesn't know what really happened, so he/she couldn't really say what was going on inside the house of Emily."
4,Re-read starting April 1! Will review after :)
5,"5 Stars! 
 It's a difficult, psychologically challenging book. YOU SHOULD READ IT! 
 ""This isn't a romance. You're not a damsel in distress and I'm not the handsome prince come to save you."" 
 You may find some spoilers below. BEWARE! 
 I liked this book for several reasons. 
 Although there's sometimes TMI for my taste, this peace of art kept it's own style through all the book. NO BS. Naked truth! 
 Main Characters Livvie (aka Kitten) and Caleb (aka Master{*roll-my-eyes*}) 
 Livvie is a girl (with a turn for Stockholm's) with demons of her own. 
 She's 18 and from very young age she'd been told that when she'll grow-up, she'll become a whore! WTF? What sane parents would say that? None.I know it and you know it! But seems like she's not so sure about that {*roll-my-eyes*} 
 And yeah, the irony of it all, she will become a whore after all. 
 {Hope not, but it's not my place to decide that.} 
 But in her heart she's a fighter! You can almost smell the spirit coming through! So I'm very positive she'll never become a whore or a slave. Not in her heart, anyway.. 
 Caleb ... Now he's one fucked-up Mo'Fo! I mean really??!! Capture a girl, then make her into a sex-slave and sold her to a man you despise so much.. (???) 
 WOW! 
 Very clever! 
 What the hell is wrong with you? Gheeezuz!! I mean you're not the only one in the world who had more then terrible things to go through! No need to go all Rembo on a poor girl! 
 Don't worry, I still have hope for you. 
 Recommendations: 
 If you like reading about nasty things - this book is probably for You! 
 Not that it's to creepy. It's not. Just reading about beat-up crying woman, takes a lot of nerves and courage. 
 My feeling registration: 
 My feelings about this book are very conflicting. 
 I like the whole story.. 
 I hate how he treat's her.. 
 But I like how he's changing. Opening to her, to himself. And that's one of the best things in this book. Things get better in some freaky way. 
 But there's still so much demon's inside Caleb, that the HELL feels deserted. 
 So, despite what I wrote so far, this book is written very well. 
 I liked that readers can see both Livvie's and Caleb's POV's. That helps to understand more of what the hell is in their heads. 
 That's all from me :)"
4,"This might just top Sookie as my favorite paranormal romance series. It is absolutely brilliant; I just finished reading the 4 books that are out so far. 
 Bones and Cat are fantastic characters. Cat's narration is fantastic...the wit and sarcasm of her personality shine through and it is all very entertaining to read. Between her commentary and the dialogue between her and Bones...I'm surprised I'm not sore from all the laughing I did. 
 I really can't recommend this enough to fantasy and romance fans. I promise you will enjoy it."
3,"Rating Clarification: The majority of the book hovered around around a four for me, but I really disliked the ending of the novel so I've compensated by lowering the rating to a three. I didn't care much for the narrator's own quest, and it was largely overshadowed by the four men's stories at the tavern. Even though the book did its best to wrap these narratives together at the end (and I understood the thematic relevance of the ending), I didn't find it compelling or satisfying. The twist-ending, the shift of power, was slightly more satisfying; however, I'm not sure if it was necessary. I found a great charm in the tales of the four men in the pub, and, somehow, the overarching story wasn't as impressive as the stories within the story, all by themselves. 
 That being said, 
 [image error] 
 Framed by the story of five men trapped in by a snowstorm in a tavern. Four men have had their sense of innocence and reality warped by an otherworldly encounter. One man, a disbeliever, is now engaged in a quest to retrieve an ancient book that very may hold the answers that connects all of the lore contained in the four terrible tales. Trappers caught in the woods during the midst of a snowstorm because stalked by a creature known as the Wendigo. An abbey poised on the the site of Satanic ritual. Shadows threatening patients at an insane asylum, bringing old loyalties into question. A sea captain driven off course to encounter a ghost ship that is navigated by a dead man who has an alluring possession. Overall, I loved these four tales, but I found the overarching connecting story to be weaker than the sum of it's parts. I would recommend this read to those interested in the occult, the old school horror, and supernatural suspense. It was a great read to enhance the Halloween spirit, and it takes on a extra level of spooky when being read with wind and rain crashing into the windowpanes. If Hurricane Sandy causes a power outage, I'll definitely be spooked just a few extra degrees more because of this read. 
 I received this - autographed from the author - after I didn't receive it through a Good Reads contest *big Cheshire cat grin* It was very kind of him, and it was certainly appreciated. I'm very glad to have had the opportunity to read it. 
 Many, many thanks to this awesome man. It has been shortlisted on my very long to read list."
5,"One of Nicholas' Sparks books that I really like. 
 Just like every Nicholas Sparks' novel, it made me cry, and it was so good! 
 The plot and characters are perfect."
2,"Woooof that was rough. WAY more drama. Total trainwreck I couldn't look away from. The annoying thing is that I don't want to wait the next month for book three. #CRACK. I hated almost every aspect of this but by the end I was ready for more. Also, totally predicted that ending."
4,"This is a solid four stars. I enjoyed it immensely, however, I felt the synopsis told a bit of a fib. 
 ""...a fierce competition is underway..."" 
 ""Despite the high stakes..."" 
 Makes it sound like an intense battle, doesn't it? When I found this on Amazon, I thought, ""Oh cool! Are they going to have an epic wizard duel in a circus arena?"" The fierce competition part intrigued me, but the night circus itself intrigued me even more. 
 Let me start this review with the good: 
 I LOVED, LOVED, 
 LOVED 
 the descriptions of the circus. I cannot even begin to tell you how badly I want to live there! I used to think I wanted to live in the Shire, or Wonderland or some other place, but no. After reading this, I can't get the circus out of my mind. The parts that read in second-person, as though you're experiencing it yourself, made me smile. Literally. I would sit there, reading the same sentence over again with a doofy little grin on my face. And somehow, certain parts gave me an overwhelming feeling of nostalgia, with a dash of homesickness. It was so magical and so very beautiful. I wanna be a reveur! 
 *wails and angsts inwardly* 
 Not only did I love the circus, I loved a certain set of twins and their little friend, too! I've seen several reviewers say they didn't like Bailey, or they thought it was a pointless side story or something of that manner. I have to disagree. I could relate to Bailey quite well, and he was that kind of character that I could immediately picture. I was greatly entertained reading about him sneaking away to encounter the wonders of the circus, and his adventures with Widget and Poppet. Also, I actually found his romance with Poppet way more interesting than Celia and Marco's. I could totally feel the chemistry between them, and it was so sweet and fun to read. I kept skipping ""ahead of time"" so I could find out what the trio would do next. Hopefully, I'm not alone in doing this..heh heh. 
 Of course, it's rare to find that perfect book, so I will now explain my reasons for the missing star. 
 The synopsis fibbed, as I wrote in the beginning. I wouldn't say it was a flat-out lie, but definitely an exaggeration. The ""competition"" was in no way fierce. If you really want to know why that is, then please go read the 1 and 2 star reviews. It's been said a million times and I really don't want to have to say it again, okay? 
 *sigh* Yeah, pretty significant disappointment. 
 The whole competition in general was a disappointment, really. 
 I felt very little chemistry between Celia and Marco, which is obviously a pretty important factor, considering they are the main characters. Tip: Just because two characters are like, ""omg i lub u!"" and ""lol ur so sweet, i luv u too!"" doesn't mean readers will fall in love with them as well. 
 Overall, I really enjoyed this book. I would read it again purely to relive the magic and the joy of the circus. 
 I think this would be a perfect Tim Burton movie! I can just see it now, and man, is it gorgeous..."
4,"I had some pretty big problems with this book, but there were also some things I absolutely loved about it. Very different from The Knife of Never Letting Go, but great in its own way."
1,"** spoiler alert ** 
 Katniss is a girl who is forced to enter the Hunger Games, is successful and returns home. Shes a strong, independent child who has aged considerably from caring for her family. She is in short, a heroine in the making. 
 The second book Katniss is a little more selfish, thinking only of herself when the announcement of the second hunger games is aired on television. She does put Peeta first, though and attempts to save him. The whole book is about her learning to love Peeta, and her love triangle of Peeta-Gale-Katniss. 
 In the final book, we see the fall of the Capitol, and the war resulting from all of the things Katniss has done during the games to undermine the President and the Capitol's strict control over the districts. She spends most of the book running around, half drugged, and feeling sorry for herself. She doesn't spend much time worrying about her family, whom she has spent so much time protecting, which seems unrealistic..but whatever. 
 Pros: 
 Peeta and Katniss finally get together 
 Capitol falls, and the human race has the ability to grow into a peaceful society 
 Coin dies, she was a terrible addition to the story 
 Now for the rant: 
 Katniss shoots down hover planes with arrows. End of her involvement with the war. 
 They run all over the Capitol to find the president to kill him and she ends up burned badly and misses the WHOLE end of the war 
 Prim dies, seriously? She had such a minor role in the book, and is basically abandoned by the only person in the world she loves more than her mother..and then we kill her and her sister doesn't even seem to CARE? 
 Katniss undergoes PTS, which is fine, except she didn't really do anything the whole damn book but get high, whine, sleep, and prance in front of cameras. Peeta keeps it together better than her! 
 Peeta forgets he loves our heroine, but this is how Katniss realizes she never appreciated him. This would have been a fantastic part of the story to focus on, but instead we focus on Gale and his supposed unexpected harshness. We later see Katniss thinking he was always that way. Yes, he was, but the situation helped him along. Katniss also spent the whole time thinking of herself instead of what Gale experienced the WHOLE time she was in the arena. 
 Finally, president Snow dies and we don't care how? What the hell? Was it poison? I care very much, he was a lead character in the entire novel. Although, I realized half way through the book that he probably wasn't as evil as Katniss made him out to be. In the end, its Coin who is the evil one, and Snow who is merely immoral. Really, the plot became cliche after that. 
 I gave the book 1 star because so much is unanswered at the end: Snow's death, what happens to Katniss' mother after the loss of her youngest child, and how the hell Peeta suddenly got so mentally healthy. 
 Oh right. AND KATNISS DOESN'T EVEN LOVE PEETA IN THE END. She is a selfish woman at the end of the book. In reality, i doubt someone like Peeta would have stuck around for someone who ""settles"" for him because he's safe. Nor would a man like Gale have put up with her crap. 
 AND the last chapter just felt tacked on. Here's how all the loose ends tied up, but no details. 
 What a fantastic waste of a story that had such promise for a VERY memorable ending that would have made this series a classic. 
 Haymitch is right, Peeta deserved better. So did Gale, her family and the readers."
5,"THIS BOOK IS AMAZING. 
 I loved the Until series. 
 And I can't wait for these new ones: Until Him and Until Her series. 
 I am BEYOND THRILLED that July has a lot of friends (and family) and that Wes has a lot of hot friends as well. I see promising things in the future."

 Enoch's latest highland historic romance is out today! I am an avid fan of Enoch's work. I love her wit, her characters and storylines. This while an improvement over book 1 in the series, still falls short of what I think as her best work. 
 The book started off slow. The prologue was a full chapter length prologue, basically consisting of our heroine Majorie lamenting her social outcast situation in the ton since she used to be a paid companion before her brother inherited a dukedom unexpectedly, and having small talk with her own companion. I know our writer is setting the scene, but it could have been done in a more riveting way than a whole chapter of internal monologue. If the story opened with the kidnapping then cutting back to her thoughts on why she left and how she felt, maybe it would have worked better. 
 The middle chapters were the best, full of wit, and fun, watching our Gabriel and his family of brothers get to know Majorie. Then it got more and more outlandish as our hero not only keeps his kidnapped heroine but (view spoiler)[kidnaps her chaperone as well to quell inquiries. (hide spoiler)] 
 I don't mind outlandish plots - I love Dare's work and she sets up some of the craziest situations. But I kept wondering how he was going to dig himself out of a worsening situation. Gabriel kept making decisions that I question a mature man would make, even with his back to the wall as it was. The serious situation, with a threat looming, made it perhaps hard to continue on the same vein as the middle chapters. And of course, all the kidnap victims agree quickly not to betray the family. 
 Of course, Enoch finds a way to make it all work in the end for our duo, so you just have to hang on to your questions as you turn the pages. The last few chapters are action packed. 
 I wonder what's next for this series, and if Enoch plans to stay in the highland forever. After reading London's Perfect Scoundrel this week I feel like she could maybe use a change of pace and continue this series at a later point.

1,"Son was a huge disappointment. I expected so much more from Lowry in this last book of the series, especially since we were ending where the series began: in Jonas' colourless world. 
 The beginning was interesting and haunting. While it was stated in The Giver that children were given careers at twelve, careers which included Birthmothers, it never really struck me that these little girls would be forced to give birth. The fact that Claire was thirteen when she got pregnant, fourteen when she gave birth, forced to do it and the fact that she didn't know it wasn't normal made me nauseous. 
 But it also made me question. If there are Birthmothers then where are the sperm donors? Do little boys get chosen for that career path? I feel like this should have been explained better. 
 (view spoiler)[Warning: Here there be Spoilers! 
 My biggest issue with this book was the setting. The story starts before and during (and later after) the events of The Giver. I understand why this was done, to show the birth of Claire's child, but I think the story would have flowed much better had it been set after Jonas leaves in The Giver. 
 I think a prologue section of Claire giving birth could have been done, and then a jump to the crumbling of Jonas' society. Considering the society is emotionless it would have been much more interesting if Claire became aware and concerned for her child after the emotions were given back to the people and her journey could have started there. 
 Another issue was that Jonas' world didn't feel the same. The reader gets to become more personal with Jonas' father in this book as well as other characters in the book whereas in The Giver we really only had Jonas and the Giver. 
 I know it's tricky to write characters who are not exactly emotionless, but thinking they possess certain emotions when they don't (if that makes sense) but these characters seemed to be much angrier than in The Giver. It's hard to describe but it felt so different. 
 END OF SPOILERS!(view spoiler)[ 
 Son was just too long with too many pointless side stories and characters, not to mention the ""big"" fight at the end. 
 Overall, I prefer The Giver as a standalone novel. I think it creates a bigger impact on the reader, and I love the ambiguity in the ending. I understand I didn't need to read this series since technically series is the wrong word to use. The other three books are companions to The Giver. 
 I think the next time I read The Giver I'll leave it as it is. Leave it to ambiguity and the full force that the narrative hit me with the first time I read it. (hide spoiler)] (hide spoiler)]"
3,"The last half redeemed this trilogy for me. 
 The author has definite writing skill and can write hot steamy sex scenes but the inner monologues felt repetitive and so much happened that, even for a fiction romance novel, made it more soap opera than romance novel."
5,"4.5 stars. 
 Uninvited is one of those books where the summary made me shake my head and think...huh? The Scarlet Letter meets Minority Report...sounds weird right? Well I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised with this one and if you enjoy a book that includes a great story and quite a bit of action all the while giving you the opportunity to determine whether you believe in nature vs. nurture, you might like this one. 
 Davy Hamilton is living in a world where people believe that deviants are born with something in them that makes them the way they are. The government has decided the only way they can control the population of those that carry the kill gene is to test everyone and make sure they know where they are and what they are doing at all times. They do this by registering them and then tracking just about everything they do. If they break any rules, they run the risk of being imprinted which visually marks them as an HTS. 
 When Davy's test comes back positive her whole world is turned upside down. This wasn't part of her plans and everyone she knows and cares about is afraid of her and convinced that she will kill someone someday. As her life changes, Davy meets others who have tested positive for HTS and eventually comes to rely on them not only as friends but for survival. 
 I really enjoyed the characters in this book. Davy is clearly struggling with just how much her life changes over such a short period of time and she definitely changes throughout the book. She goes from leading this sheltered life of privilege to one where she is ostracized for something she might do someday because of a supposed gene. 
 I can honestly say Tori and Zac pissed me off so kudos to you Sophie Jordan for making me hate them so much. It is so hard to imagine that they could be Davy's best friend and boyfriend one minute and then treat her the way they did the next. It made my heart hurt for Davy that she had to deal with their prejudice and then ultimately, she was punished for what happened. 
 I also thought her parents were kind of sucky. It was almost like once they heard about Davy, they completely checked out of her life. Yeah, her dad pretty much vanished and her mom, despite being around, doubted who Davy was and who she was going to be. 
 Gil is perfect and I love that he becomes the friend that Davy needs when everything goes down. Also knowing he will be around makes me happy. 
 Sean makes an impact from the first time he shows up on the page and calls Davy Princess. He's strong physically but he's been through quite a bit in his life and that has made him strong emotionally as well. He has built up walls to protect himself and when he meets Davy, things change for him. He tries to keep his distance and warns her to stay away but eventually she gets under his skin and Sean can't seem to make himself not care about her. 
 Shortly after Davy is identified as a carrier, something happens that causes the government to take action against the carriers. They decide that the best place for all of them is in Detention Camps and Davy realizes she is going to be shipped off. What happens next is where the action begins. Davy, because she is so talented and smart, is one of a few carriers chosen to go to Mount Haven and train. No one is very clear about what she is training for but eventually it becomes clear. The only thing the government wants from them is obedience. 
 The last half of the book is where most of the action happens and we really see what Davy and the others at Mount Haven are being forced into. It is hard to believe just how much Davy's life has changed an she clearly struggles with it. When something happens that makes her doubt who she really is, she also struggles with the idea that she deserves to be happy and have a life. I get it but I just wanted her to recognize that she didn't really have a choice in what happened. 
 I do wish we had gotten a bit more information on Mitchell. It was implied that he had issues but there wasn't really any backstory given and all I saw was how much he cared about Davy. I hope we see more of him in the next book. 
 I will absolutely be waiting anxiously for the next book in the series and am looking to see what Jordan has in store for this group. Hopefully someone will take pity on me and send me an early copy (hint, hint). 
 Thank you to Edelweiss and HarperTeen for the review copy."

 Although this is the bad boy changed by one woman, I still found this read interesting. I also found this author refreshing because she went places other authors might find taboo. Still at times, I found things a bit predictable. But overall certainly worth the read.

5,"Book 2 of the Tales of the Underlight is even better than Book 1. Jolie is now a member of the Underlight and she had been training under Hauk in order to prepare herself for mission. But don't worry she still works as a Burlesque dancer! That woman is seriously hot and spunky. I'm glad whiny brat Whitney is no longer in the picture, I can't stand that kid. This time Travis, who we knew from Book 1 that worked as Jolie's apartment valet, become a more prominent character. Together with Brayden, Christin, Mercy and LaRoche, we had a whole cast of Underlight members who are truly loyal and great friends of Hauk. 
 From the ending of Book 1, Jolie and Hauk had formed a tight friendship during their mission of saving Whitney. She admire his bravery and strength and know that behind his severely scarred body, is a good man. While, Hauk still had a big crush on this girl, he is happy enough to be her best friend. In Book 2, we had some generic couple drama, the appearance of ex. Although it might be a tad generic and overdone in the old days, I'm totally soaking it up. Ashley, Hauk's ex-fiancee appearance at the Underlight really causes some serious jealousy problem and make Jolie realize her feelings for Hauk. Meanwhile, Paul, the rock star and also Jolie's ex-lover also came to add in more conflict. I wanted to pull away both Ashley and Paul and ask them to get the hell away. I kept twisting my Kindle while reading this train-wreck scenario and keep shouting 'talk to him/her already' in my mind. The tension build up is heart palpating. And when the words is finally out, I breathe a big sigh of relief. 
 We know that our Hauk can turned into a Hulk when he is in rage, minus the green body. After the rage, he will end up in a dead sleep and wake up with no knowledge of what had happen. The evil Ananke had finally found a magical weapon that can weaken Hauk fighting ability and they wanted to capture him for scientific study. Meanwhile, the truth of the fire that causes Hauk to be in current condition with his comrades all dead is starting to sneak out. It starting to resemble a plot of conspiracy theory to me. Everything is not what it seems. 
 There isn't any cliffhanger here, but of course many things are still unresolved pertaining the Ananke's evil scheme. I'm happy with how things ended Jolie and Hauk though. The third and final book 'When Beauty Loved the Beast' will be out on May 13."

5,"I won an autographed copy of this book from the publisher through a goodreads.com first-reads giveaway. Now that I've taken care of the legal formalities, let me say that I really liked this book. The mystery was well presented, Carver Young is likable and believable. There's action, mystery and a little humor. The book is organized into fairly short chapters, which makes the reading seem faster, and each chapter does seem complete in itself, so it isn't annoying. There are two big reveals in the book, the first minor one I saw coming a long way off, but the second one I only suspected a page or two before and I was still slightly off in how it happened as it was being described. I'm usually pretty good at spotting the surprise twists in books, so this was a rare treat. 
 As for target audience, this book is hard to place. Outside of the basic premise of Jack the Ripper and a few descriptions of his crimes, there wasn't any objectionable material in the book. No sex, little profanity (and only mild as I remember), and considering the subject matter, not gory. 
 This is a great book, and I intend to look up other books by the author."
3,"Hmmm, this is a tough one to rate. I liked it, but I didn't love it. While I really do appreciate that this is basically an ode to gaming nerdom and 80's pop culture, it started to feel a little gimmicky to me after a while. (Also, I'm a 90s kid so some of the references were unfortunately lost on me.) I definitely loved the concept, but the actual plot and characters didn't shine, in my opinion. That being said, I am really interested to see how Spielberg adapts this into a feature film. That should be interesting!"
4,"Very, very good! I love how their lives are ties together, even though they're unaware of it! A must read!"
5,"I knew from the moment I read ""Someone lives and someone dies at Simon's ascension ceremony"" that this book was going to be rough. I had a good feeling about who Clare was going to kill off and my guess was completely correct. In fact, I had been seeing a lot of fan theories that were actually true to exactly what happened. Still, It didn't make reading it any easier. This book was definitely a tear jerker, but Clare has always been adamant on killing characters to add meaning and depth to the story. She's definitely not wrong, but it doesn't make it easier to read. Still, and amazing book (as always)."
1,"i'm sorry. 
 this is the first time in a long period in that i was struggeling to read a book. 
 the book and i didn't start well, i saw it in the bookshop a few times, each time it was warmly recommended to me yet i didn't take it. my gut saud i wouldn't like it. 
 then' there was a sale in the bookshop, i needed 4 books and i had only 3, so i picked this one out. the cover was different from last time and i thought; 'oh well, some new book'. 
 after that i forgot i had it,when i arranged my book shlef i found it and decided to give it a chance and read it. 
 the story was predictable, really. the third person narrator didn't work for me. Jace was nice, but Clairy was pal. this is all IMO. i kept waiting for it to get interesting but it didn't. 
 pepole who loved Harry potter may like it. pepole who want a story about a world that lives next to our own, with all kinds of weird countries that are 'hidden'. pepole who likes stories about a young ordinary girl who discovers she ain't that ordinary, who likes a story about a missing parent that needs a rescue and a bit of drama might like it. 
 the question is how much do you care if the plot is original or the characters have depth (again IMO), and then, whether or not the writing style matters to you. it's not bad, it's just not my cup of tea."
5,"Reread this book after a few years, still as good, if not even better, when I can now see all the hidden hints Maas planted alluding to future reveals. Love."
4,"I'm so thrilled that Ryne got his own book! I enjoyed Melody and her clumsy but adorable ways. The plot was predictable, but as I said with the first novel, that's just how I like my romance. I knew Ryne was a nice guy but misunderstood from the first novel, but in this it really shows how easy it would be to misunderstand him. In this book, Ryne is a total ass, I still thought he was funny and sweet, but the way he treated Mel drove me crazy. I knew there was a kind and sensitive guy hiding in there, but it was all hidden by posturing and trying to keep his pack safe. I could understand why Ryne needed to keep his distance, but he was terrible at it, and it only hurt Melody. I know his wolf wanted him to be connected, but I just think that Ryne should've handled the situation better. The side characters always make this series better for me, and I adored the hilarious Lucy, gigantic Armand, sweet Ruth, and nosy Beth. They just put the perfect bow on this present. I'm also glad to see that there will be a continuation with the series, I'm concerned about Cassandra, and I'm hopeful that Bryan will be able to find her. I'm definitely looking forward to the next one!"
4,"A fun (and funny), heartfelt book that explores the impact of WWII on a people. I enjoyed the literary references, thought the letter format worked well, and enjoyed the romance though I maybe missed a clue or two early on about the direction it was going to head."
2,"With the great power comes... the great deaths. 
 Nothing good comes from knowledge. And Mara learned it the hard way. Knowing who she is and of what she is capable of wasn't in favour of her. She ended up into a medical facility separated from her family and friends and the last thing she remembers is the collapsing building and Noah left behind. Now she has to fight her own self to figure out what is happening and how to get out of there. But with a little help from friends everything is easier. And when they have powers just like hers even better. Will she be able to finds out why she's different from the others? Will she be able to find Noah and is it Noah even alive? Bettter start reading, because those questions wouldn't answer themselves. 
 I've read that book half and year after the previous 2, so the memory was fuzzy, but still I can't say I like it as much as the first ones. I mean here the main character was like a crazy psychopath that wasn't sure what is happening, but it seems as killing people was the right answer to the question no one asked. And no, even the weird circumstances didn't convince me that's the best decision in this case scenario. I mean I didn't like the character before, but now he didn't even tried to be at least half likeable. And the whole scheme that was the trigger to all of that was kinda out of place. It not only sounded impossible, but it wasn't presented in the best way. 
 Aside from that I like the writing style of the author, tho this time there were so many fandom references that made the story fun, but also sounding as if an 18 years old had wrote it. 
 Still can't say I like the book. I don't know if the reason was the impossible things in it, strange acting from the characters or just the fact I've read it more than an year later from the last books, but still I didn't like it. It was ok, but I really do expected much more."
2,"Comparable to the Twilight and Harry Potter series in terms of writing. Don't expect to be wowed. However even though it sounds like a high schooler wrote the book (perhaps because it was a high schooler), there is an emotional connection the reader will achieve with the characters populating the story. 
 Not a fan a l33t,so definitely not a fan of it showing up in books. Also finished reading with a dirty feeling, like I'd read other teenage girl books like Gossip Girl."
4,Overall it was a pretty good story. I really liked the characters. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star was because I waited through the whole book for the scene where the killer would come to realize Marlie was able to see the killings in a vision and when that time finally came it was a huge disappointment. I won't say why because it will ruin the story for you. I still loved the ending though. Should have been called Nightmare man!!! Wish they would have a story for grace and Alex (trammel) *hint to Linda* happy reading

5,"This book...this book!!! I laughed, I teared up, I swooned and had all the feels. The banter between all the characters is spot on, but the couple's chatter blew it out of the water. What an intense, intense connection! 
 Fantastic character development, especially for the hero. That's quite rare in a contemporary romance, and I was pleasantly surprised. 
 Great flow, vivid writing, a book I truly enjoyed and was eager to get back to every time I had to put the book down. I have a new favorite author, and highly recommend!"
4,"There's a lot of table setting in this book. While I still found the first half interesting, I didn't find there was that much going on initially: just lots of expositions with ideas and concepts that were a little foreign with characters that were interesting, but didn't seem to have all that much to do. However, around the halfway mark, the story shifts into high gear. I wouldn't say all the slower paced exposition was absolutely necessary, but once we get into the real thrust of the narrative, I had a hard time putting the book down until I reached the end. From what I understand, many of Reynolds' books take place in the same universe (this was the first book I've read by this author), so if I end up running into Purslane and Campion later on, that would make me very happy. I really grew to like those characters (and Hesperus as well). 
 All in all, a very good book that requires a little patience initially but rewards the reader with a twisting story full of wonder, adventure and big ideas."

 Actual Rating 4.5 
 This book. Oh my god this book. I'd be lying if I said I didn't know what I was getting into before I started reading the book but knowing how many emotions you will be bombarded with doesn't really prepare you for them. Nothing does until you'll sitting there yelling at the book for giving you too many feels (this happened). This book is so gorgeously written and so beautifully imagined and I don't know where to start. 
 Perhaps I shall start with the one thing that didn't work for me and then move on to all the good stuff because good stuff. 
 There is so much build up and so many emotions running through this book that by the time I got to the ending, I had expected something big and huge but I didn't get that. The resolutions seemed too easy after everything our characters had been through. And while it may be surprising that I am even suggesting this given the size of the book (it stands at a whopping 592 pages... for the final copy), I think this book should have been longer. I needed a stronger resolution. One that didn't leave me feeling like I had missed out on a big chunk of these characters' lives. 
 So there, bad stuff out of the way. Now on to the good stuff. The stuff I cannot even begin describing because I am not sure I am capable of doing justice to this book with my limited vocabulary. Soooooo... this book IS AWESOMESAUCE. It's heartbreaking, it's diverse and it's so so GOOD. It takes you on a roller coaster of emotions and when you start to fall, you are left hanging, hoping for the best, hoping against hope that there will be a happy ending even though real life offers few. How can I explain the roller coaster of emotions? How can I even begin to explain how MUCH PAIN I WAS IN. How much joy I felt and all the mushy gushy feelings in my heart. Stupid hearts. Making you feel stuff. I think I need to take a break from my heart. HEART, I NEED SPACE OKAY? 
 This book is divided into 4 parts. The first 3 introduce you to three different characters who are all connected by one simple harmonica, a harmonica that will bring them joy when life will seem bleak, a harmonica that has a magical background story and a harmonica that has a purpose. 
 Friedrich lives in pre World War II Germany, in a world where he gets to slowly experience Hitler's rise to power. He is witness to all the injustices committed against his fellow friends and even his own father. It's heartbreaking to read about all these injustices and it's even more heartbreaking to know what might happen to Friedrich if they don't leave Germany. The thing that is so fascinating about Friedrich though is how he manages to retain his beliefs even knowing what could be done to him because of them. The only reason he isn't out there screaming about the injustice of it all is because he doesn't want to endanger his family. His story, unsurprisingly, is a heartbreaking one. 
 Then we have Mike and Frankie. Their story is just as heartbreaking even if there lives aren't as affected by the World War. What they are is orphans, living in a time period where no one cares as much about orphans. Mike, at the young age of 11, has to be incharge of his younger brother and making sure that the two aren't separated. At the tender age of 11, he has to put someone else's safety and happiness above his own and if that isn't heartbreaking, I don't know what is. Mike is just as brave and lovable as Friedrich and his journey just as beautiful to read about. 
 The last main character we meet is young Ivy who lives in California. Who, on top of having to deal with moving to a new place, has to deal with injustices at school because of the color of her skin. She just wants to play her music but she cannot even do that in peace. She has to hold her family together, because she promised her brother who is away at war but how can she do that when she has trouble holding herself together? Throughout her story, we get to Ivy grow into herself and mature. We see her make new friends and we see her grow protective about a Japanese family she hasn't even met. It makes you wonder how these kids can even stand to think about someone other than themselves when their situations are so dire. Their hearts must be so ginormous. 
 I don't want to talk too much about the historical and magic realism contexts of this novel but know that Pam Ryan Munoz knows what she is doing. This novel may not be about the historical events but the historical setting is NEVER forgotten. It's what affects all of these young kids' lives. 
 The stories of these three young kids are moving and heartbreaking but at the same time, they offer hope. They show us that not all is lost even when things look like they are never going to get better. 
 This book is so important and so beautiful and I don't know what else to say except that you all need to read this. I went into this book knowing I would love it since Ryan is one of my favorite childhood authors and all I can hope is that when you read it, you'll love it just as much as I did."
3,"This was a satisfying conclusion to the Sio Saga---well-written overall, with moments of beauty. But, like many series-enders, it was a bit to focused on plot for my liking. I often reach that point with series which are winding down---the wonder and richness and charm of the early books gives way to a series of event after event meant to tie up the loose ends, and some of the magic gets lost for me amidst the flow chart on my head of who and what and where. 
 An overall nicely done ending, but this was no 'Wool' for me."
4,"Donald Harstad ""Academy Field Trip"" 
 This story was just hilarious. I found the agent brilliant in his responses. 
 Amber Benson ""Carrie Meet Happy"" 
 Ok now I have to find this series. I really liked this author's writing style. 
 Charlaine Harris ""Playing Possum"" 
 I'm so over Sookie Stackhouse, it's not even funny! I feel that anything after book 8 (From Dead to Worse), is just flogging a dead horse. 
 Marjorie M. Liu ""Sympathy for the Bones"" 
 Well look at that; this is where all the gold has been! 
 Jonathan Maberry ""Spellcaster 2.0"" 
 This story at first didn't make a lot of sense to me. It didn't seem that there was much of a real plot until a quarter of the way through. Then bang it just hits you. Compared to Maberry's novella in Four Summoner's Tales this was vastly different. So I'll be on the look out for more of this author's work. 
 Toni L.P. Kelner ""Pirate Dave and the Captain's Ghost"" 
 I read this again on May 22,2017, just because I need to read something lighthearted and both short stories came to mind. 
 It was like a little bit of happiness in my crummy week.... 
 A good portion of the stories were full of awesomeness. Some characters I knew, and others well I look forward to meeting them soon. 
 Don't shy away from some of the older characters. 
 Have fun with this one guys! 
 Cheers Pretties!"
3,"My friend Danielle let me borrow the first three volumes of this series. I just finished the first one and I have to say that I LOVE the illustrations. The comic book characters are very pretty and eye catching. Let's get one thing straight, you aren't reading these books for the stories but for the art. The story is pretty good too though. I didn't find it boring. Well, the only part that I thought was boring was the pages were the lyrics just goes across the pages and there is no action going on. I like looking at those pages though, but it's hard to follow the lyrics that I just give up. I look forward to reading the other two and seeing how the story progresses. I have to say that so far my favorite character is Kimber. There's is just something so genuine and corky about her. I also love her various hairstyles throughout the book. The girl just can't make up her mind."
5,"Laughed out loud only at the funny bits... swooned only at the romantic bits... loved all of it. 
 I couldn't stop reading this book... 
 It was annoyingly frustrating every time Lexie didn't see what I as the reader was meant to see, but it ended how I always wanted it to so I'm willing to forgive! 
 Lisa Desrochers sets the scene and develops the characters beautifully. It was believable... the plot didn't feel as 'messed-up' as a quasi-sibling relationship should sound. The hot-n-heavy is tasteful and very sporadic... I like that it forms part of the story and that the story isn't just squeezed around it like in some books of the same genre. 
 Will definitely be looking out for the next book in this series. 
 I sooo recommend this book"
5,"We Americans live in a world where choice reigns supreme. Everything from what exotic fruit to enjoy at any given time of year to when and whether to have children is up to our choosing. Whether we should make those choices is an entirely different question. That requires wisdom, faith, and a well-formed conscience. But what happens when people aren't willing to learn, to trust, and to reason? What if they choose incorrectly? Would it be better to just take away their ability to choose? 
 In the futuristic world of Lois Lowry's barely twenty-year-old classic, The Giver, the government has reached exactly that conclusion.

2,"The end of over a decade of books. So long Sookie and friends you will be missed. 
 Description: 
 There are secrets in the town of Bon Temps, ones that threaten those closest to Sookie--and could destroy her heart... 
 Sookie Stackhouse finds it easy to turn down the request of former barmaid Arlene when she wants her job back at Merlotte's. After all, Arlene tried to have Sookie killed. But her relationship with Eric Northman is not so clearcut. He and his vampires are keeping their distance...and a cold silence. And when Sookie learns the reason why, she is devastated. 
 Then a shocking murder rocks Bon Temps, and Sookie is arrested for the crime. 
 But the evidence against Sookie is weak, and she makes bail. Investigating the killing, she'll learn that what passes for truth in Bon Temps is only a convenient lie. What passes for justice is more spilled blood. And what passes for love is never enough. 
 My Thoughts: POSSIBLE SPOILERS 
 Well, this book has brought a lot of controversy to the book reading community. Most didn't like the ending. I have to agree, however there were some really interesting points to the book. I liked 3/4 of the book. I enjoyed seeing some of Sookies friends return to help her. I was disappointed that the vampires were hardly in it at all. I enjoyed the basic plot of the story it was fairly fast moving and kept my attention. I knew from past books that I would enjoy the the characters. I don't believe there were any new characters introduced. I there seemed to be threads left hanging that were not tied up. Why was Horst coming to visit Sookie? How did Tyrese get through the wards. I know he had no soul but it was explained earlier in the book that ""those with evil intent"" and his intent was evil. We can assume what happened with Bob and Tyrese however we were not told exactly what happened. The curse in Albee's car we can assume who placed it there but it wasn't explained. Sam tried to keep Sookie from the bar because of his ""deal"" but he had to know that would not work in the long term, it just managed to make him feel bad. I could go on but I won't. 
 The ending...well really did it end. We got no HEA...we got a maybe...and I was not surprised by who she ended up with but it was very anticlimatic I was hoping it would be someone completely unexpected. The way it ended was just kinda boring. So for me it was meh. I respect Charlene Harris but I have to admit the earlier books in the series were really the best. 
 So long Sookie, thanks for all the hours of enjoyment you gave me, I hope to see you in rereads at least of the first 9 books:) 
 I have given this book 2 to 2.5 stars. Parts of the book were good but the overall was pretty disappointing and not really up to CH's standards. Maybe she was just bored with the characters *shrug*"
5,"Words immediately put down after reading Shades of Earth: I cannot. I cannnoootttt. I just cannot. Expect the unexpected is what this book is about. I think i guessed one twist, but everything else was just so unique. My heart just sank after each chapter near the end. I hate that this book made me want to throw it across the room and cry at some points. What a crazy, crazy, epic conclusion. I'm shocked. I cannot put into words what I'm feeling. But ""shite"" this series really is brilly and so much fun to read. Space is cool & so were the sci-fi aspects."
3,"I enjoyed this book, but not as much as the previous two. For quite a while, it felt like Alex was going around in circles. She's sad and she missed the boys. She is getting in trouble pursuing things that no one wants her to stick her nose into. 
 I was a bit disappointed in what I felt was a rather weak plot premise. (view spoiler)[Their was way too much conflict over her getting involved in the suicide case, however, no one else seemed to making any headway. In fact, to all appearances, she was the most qualified to be involved. Not only was this kind of silly, but she seems to internalize and accept the criticism. Ugh. (hide spoiler)] 
 I'd like to see a less whiny and conflicted Alex in future books."
2,"My Name Is Memory's story line was fascinating. Imagine a man who can remember his past lives. He has spent the majority of those lives searching for a woman he met hundreds of years ago. His reason for perusing this woman is because he felt an unexplained connection to her at first sight. He has found her soul in several of his new lives, but it was always impossible for them to be together. Romantic isn't it? In modern day Virginia, Daniel has finally tracked down his Sophia (known now as Lucy). Close in age and free of commitments, Daniel hopes this is his chance for a happily ever after with the woman he fell in love with lifetimes ago. 
 I devoured the majority of this book. Unfortunately, the ending was dissatisfying and left this reader without the closure I so very much desired. Open endings like this can be done well, but I don't feel like that was the case with My Name is Memory. It was so abrupt I was left feeling like my book was missing a chapter or two. I only deducted half a star from my rating because I adored the characters, and the writing was beautiful. If only the author had given me a little more at the end I would have been left a happy reader instead of disgruntled one."
4,"I am so sad to see the Selection series come to an end, but I have absolutely no issues with the way this series ended. I know that might be an unpopular opinion, but I think Cass did a fantastic job wrapping up this story and I am so happy with the happy ending all of her characters got. I really love these books and I can't wait to see what Kiera Cass writes next!"
4,"From the back of the book: 
 1. Don't leave the apartment 
 2. Never let anyone in 
 3. Don't kill anyone 
 The rules were simple and I broke them. Now I must face the consequences. Everyone else must face me. 
 Hello, my name is Millie, and I can't get enough of this series. 
 Honestly, I don't know if I'm just infatuated with this new genre (yeah, after my review of The Girl in 6E, I've decided that erotic thriller is a thing) or if I've formed a connection with Torre's writing or a bit of both, but I don't really care because I just love devouring her books. Like 6E there are several erotic scenes and strange fetishes and scary and exciting moments and times when I'm saying to myself, Deanna, what the hell are you doing!? Her lack of awareness of ""normal human life"" is both entertaining and nerve-wracking. 
 I've heard talk that this isn't exactly a direct sequel to 6E and that you could read it beforehand, but I would recommend picking up 6E first so that you get to know Deanna's character more. In this next book we're seeing how her actions from the first book are affecting her and pushing her into new circumstances...some with disastrous consequences. 
 To keep this short and sweet, I'm just going to say that I need it to be November 10 immediately so I can pick up the next book, If You Dare. Also, I hope Torre writes more than just three books in this series."
4,"This book was on my TBR pile for quite a while. Shinn's writing style in this threw me for a loop. I expected by the back blurb that it was going to be an intense thrill ride, but I received something very different under the cover. Maria Devane is the kind of character you either hate or love, but I think my relationship to her was borderline. 
 For the past fifteen years Maria has dedicated her existence to the man she loves. Dante Romano is not an ordinary man, but a shape-shifter who as time progresses is losing more of his humanity to his beastly changes. Half of the book is spent with Maria mourning Dante's transformed absences and a quarter of it is spent reliving Maria and Dante's past. 
 This novel could have done a lot more, I think. That's what is so disappointing to me. I have a few friends who have raved about Shinn's unique ability at storytelling, but I don't think it was the storytelling that got me so engrossed in this one. The convictions of her characters are what made it for me. 
 As I mentioned before, Maria is a strange character. Since college she has molded her life to fit that of her love's sporadic appearances. Only a few days a month does Dante remain human and she lives for those days. Dante is definitely flawed; he is overly secretive, he's resigned to die early (shifters tend to live to only about fifty), he refuses to father a child (even goes as far as getting a vasectomy without talking it over with Maria), and he keeps himself distant from Maria (repeating hints about her ""moving on""). 
 The short mystery of who is killing humans in parks around the county is the story's saving grace. The reason I bumped it from two and a half stars to four. I like the interjection of Christina and Lizzie because it gives me hope for Maria's sake. (AND NO I WILL NOT EXPLAIN THAT COMMENT) 
 This was most definitely a different novel from what I am used to. I don't know if I will continue with this series, but Maria and Dante were a joy to visit with. 
 4 Stars"
3,"It had been a long time since I read the first book in this series so I couldn't remember the characters and relationships very well. But it was still an entertaining read. I just realized after reading it that it basically felt like what I can enjoy in one hour of watching a TV crime drama show, but it took me several hours to read. I don't think I'll continue the series, just because there are something like 30 books in the series and I can't imagine being engaged enough or willing enough to invest the time."

 ***This review has also been posted on The Social Potato 
 Soundless by Richelle Mead was not exactly what I had hoped it would be. I went into the book expecting to be blown away but I wasn't. I liked the book and ended up devouring it but I couldn't help feeling that Richelle Mead could do 1000x times better. 
 When I first started the book, I was loving every single minute of it. I was so excited about all the ways in which Mead made the world come to life. The way she created this soundless world was fantastic because as I read the book, I could FEEL the soundlessness, I could feel it in the way the world made me anxious (I really do like my ability to hear.) I also loved the way it felt so much like a fairy tale. The world building was one of my favorite things about this book in the first 60 pages. 
 After that though, I slowly started to realize how even though there were many wonderful details, the book could have benefited from a whole lot more. 
 Their climb down the mountain was wondrous but it barely covered any page space. You don't just GET down a mountain. It's HARD and I would have liked to see more of that climb instead of little snippets. I wanted to feel that climb instead of being told it took place. 
 Then when they got into town, things were pretty rushed too. They went from one place to another and everything happened so quickly. I didn't like that. I felt like I was being rushed instead of being given time to just enjoy the world. I wanted to spend more time in the town and learn more about the outside world. I wanted to see more of the dynamics between the soundless ones and the 'regular' people. 
 There were also the mysterious dreams that were obviously a big deal but honestly, I barely remember anything about them. I think there should have been more emphasis on them too, there should have been more vibrant details. 
 And I don't mean to be picky because if it were any other author, I probably would have given the book 4 stars since I really did like it, I am just disappointed because I expect more from Mead. Maybe even a little heartbroken since this is first YA I've read by her since I finished the Vampire Academy series, which just happens to be one of my all time favs. 
 The good news is that this book features many fantastic characters and a really cute romance. 
 Fei is a fantastic female lead and I loved reading about her. I love her courage and I love that she is hesitant to leave behind what she knows. This is the system she grew up in and it isn't easy to break out of it. I also love her dedication to her sister (although I do think she could have given her more credit.) Fei is just great. She is no Rose Hathaway but she is an amazing character in her own right. 
 The romance between Fei and her romantic interest.... TO DIE FOR. So slow and so sweet. JUST THE WAY I LIKE IT, GODDAMNIT. So yeah, I had them shipper feels and I totally shipped my ship. 
 The ending did seem a little too clean for my tastes but I don't think there could have been any other ending for this book so I really cannot complain too much about that. 
 In the long run, I did end up really liking this book and felt immense satisfaction from turning over the last page but I only wish there had been more depth to the book, to make it seem all the more real to me. 
 Note that I received an advanced copy of this book in exchange for an honest review"
3,"I actually really enjoyed this book in spite of the negative feedback it has received on Goodreads. The first chapter piqued my interest, and the remainder of the novel kept it. I read the novel in a day, and it has stuck with me since, which serves as a testament (I think) to its compelling story. 
 While I wouldn't say that I actually ""liked"" Riley, I would say that she kept me entertained. I can't count the number of times I laughed out loud while reading...and not only at her, but at characters like Audrey and Evan (who are fantastic, by the way). Even though Riley would undoubtedly get on my nerves in real life, I continued reading because I wanted to see the characters' story play out. Frankly, not all main characters need to be likable for narratives to be successful, and I think to some degree we see that phenomenon play out here. 
 Plus, Max is really great. 
 Additional thoughts: 
 In many places, the inner monologue technique was either overdone or completely unnecessary. However, I think it worked well in some spots--(view spoiler)[like when the sex scenes emphasize that Max wants to make Riley feel good (as opposed to reaching his own orgasm without any regard for her pleasure), or how both of them overthink even their most basic interactions after they transition from a friendship to a romance. (hide spoiler)] 
 Max refers to Riley more than once as smart, but I did not get that vibe. Am I missing something? She doesn't seem to excel academically, she frequently makes poor choices where Noah is concerned, and she has little common sense when it comes to the job market and life after college. Instead of telling me she's smart, I would prefer to be shown that she is. 
 Finally, I would have liked a clearer picture of what Max looked like. While several characters referred to him as ""cute,"" it was frustrating that I couldn't actually picture him. 
 So based on this review, I would recommend Besse's work to some people but not to others, depending on their interests, preferences, and patience when it comes to the experience of reading. As far as my own reading is concerned, I wouldn't hesitate to pick up another book from this author: Although Since Forever Ago has its flaws, it's a satisfying read.

3,"I am really starting to wonder when this series will end. The story is a big cycle - just repeating essentially the same thing over and over again. That's not to say I won't keep reading, but I hope there is an end in sight."
4,"This should be around 4.5 stars, I think. 
 I've missed the WARDen's word. Her no nonsense lingo and the badassery of the characters. 
 This novel started a little slower than the first 3 for me, but quickly picked up. 
 I can see the logic in using Matthias as the soul in this story. He did do some horrible things in his life. And being mistaken for the soul in the last book, only to ""wrongly"" die, kind of gave him the legitimacy in having his soul saved this time. 
 Adrian's sacrifice was insanely noble and very much an ultimate sacrifice. 
 As for giving Devina one of the wins in trade for Sissy's soul - not sure I like that. I'm wondering what Devina's answer will be, but it seems wrong. If they win the war, her would be free or redeemed or whatever, anyway. I guess 3 more books at least are to be written, and if there's another win soon, the whole game is over. Sigh. 
 The only thing I wish is that they'd brought back Eddie. I miss Eddie. And he's going to be a hella pissed when he finds out about Ad."
3,"3.5 stars 
 This is the love story of Coco and Nico, who were married when they were very young, but divorced quickly. They meet again when they're 28 and 31 respectively. The chemistry is still there, but Coco's resentment and distrust is still strong after 7 years. Will Nico win Coco back? Of course he will, that's why we're reading this type of books. 
 This book is not as good as Frenched, imho, but nevertheless, it was still very enjoyable."
3,"The second novel, Magic Burns, pretty much continued in the same fashion for me. Kate is somewhat coerced into taking a job from the Pack. Retrieve a set of maps that were stolen, maps that if the wrong hands could harm the Pack. However, nothing can ever go smoothly for Kate. While searching for the missing maps Kate comes upon a young girl looking for her mother. Kate relates to this young girl, Julie, as a person who has lost her own mother and is determined that the same will not happen to Julie. 
 When Kate finally catches up to the thief she learns that because of a magical flare about to hit the world, a God and Goddess are both battling to get through a portal and into their world. Neither of whom would be a good thing walking down the street. Kate does begin to grow as a character in Magic Burns, with the help of a few friendly relationships. The girl Julie for one, and surprising the thief who may not be such a bad guy and I found myself actually rooting for. Maybe it was because he annoyed Curran so much? LoL Curran and Kate have a bigger interaction in this novel when Curran's ex-lover asks Kate for help in convincing Curran to allow her to marry Kate's own ex-boyfriend. Talk about your awkward moments! Though again this second novel was a struggle for me, maybe because of the lack of a romantic involvement, I still found myself not being about to put it down.

 16) A book about an author you love that you haven't read yet"
5,"A fascinating, compelling, heartbreaking novel that expertly melds some of humanity's deepest theological questions with our greatest science fiction fantasies. The main plot begins when music from another planet is intercepted and interpreted, and almost immediately afterwards the Society of Jesus organizes a clandestine mission to the planet where the music is coming from, Rakhat. The narrative is told in two streams: one begins shortly before the music is discovered and relates the story of the mission, while the other takes place several years after the mission's only survivor, Emilio Sandoz, returns to Earth and tells the story of the aftermath of the mission and its lasting effects on Sandoz. 
 It's impossible to describe in such a short space how fantastic The Sparrow is. The combination of some of the principles and theology of the Jesuits works shockingly well with science fiction, and makes for some uniquely profound realizations and meditations. This book is so easy to read and hard to put down- I finished it in a few days because I kept going back and reading more and more of it every time I stopped. Russell does an incredible job of portraying Rakhat first as a divinely rendered utopia and gradually revealing some of the more insidious aspects of the planet and peoples. The characters are very likeable- you want their mission to succeed so badly, even though you know from the first few pages that something goes terribly wrong. Russell has the reader laughing with them on one page and crying with them on another. Reading The Sparrow truly feels like passing time with a group of friends that love to joke as much as to pose deep questions, and when things do start going wrong, it hurts as much as if friends really were in those situations. 
 My only slight critique of this book would be the way that it ignores how much Earth would have changed in 2060. Russell explains it away fairly well, making Sandoz want to ignore the differences since he's gone through such drastic changes himself in the past few decades, but it was still frustrating - especially since the reader gets such a tease from someone who's speaking to Sandoz (I think Candotti) who wants to tell him all about the world. Russell also fails to explain how an asteroid was engineered into a spaceship that was able to travel to Rakhat. This wasn't a problem for me (since I recently read Seveneves, which gave me my fill of hard sci-fi for the year), but it does place this book squarely into the category of soft sci-fi. 
 I wish I could forget The Sparrow just so that I could read it again. Definitely one of my favorites of the year so far."
2,"Rating 2.5 
 Writing was good, but i didn't enjoy it .. The Game Panic seemed stupid ."
2,"Pawn was absurd. When you turn 17, you do a test and get a number tattooed on your neck. So, how smarter, how higher the number you get. And how higher the number, how better your social position will be. Kitty (yes, the main character) gets a three, because she DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH FUCKING TIME. WTF?! She also coincidentally looks a lot like one of the most important women in the world of Pawn (well, only her eye color, but that isn't a problem, because in that world, they can totally surgically transform you in another person. BUT THEY CAN'T CHANGE THE EYE COLOR. CONTACTS MAYBE?). Bleghh the story was boring, the characters were boring, the triangle is boring. 2 stars."
5,"While I know that some of Kenyon's other books are better written, I can't help but love this book! The sex scenes are sizzling & my favorite part- the bit characters are pretty endearing. Yup, I admit it. I read it for the character of Chris Erickson. 
 The story surrounds the character of Cassandra- someone who is doomed to die at a young age due to being half-Apollite. If that's not bad enough, she has to procreate before her expiration date or the world will end. (Not that she knows this little fact.) Enter Wulf- a sexy ex-Viking who unfortunately can't be remembered by anyone not blood related to him. Well... anyone but Cassandra, who he meets one night at the local bar as she's being hunted down by Daimons who want the young cutie dead... 
 Again, I really enjoyed this story. It's got one or two parts of it that get bogged down a little, but nothing to the extreme. (The only part I found a little dragged out was when everyone went to the Apollite city- could have been about 10-20 pages shorter.) Still, it's a great story and all of the characters are pretty endearing. I actually found myself curious as to what happened afterwards, a rarity for me!"
2,"Okay, so the collected Unwritten Fables crossover came out in July, and Fables collection 20, Camelot, officially comes out next week. I grabbed them when I saw them in store yesterday, and started reading in that order, since I wouldn't expect things to be published out of continuity. I haven't started Camelot yet, but I have a feeling I got it backwards. The world that Tommy Taylor arrived in seemed to be in a different place than the one I remembered. I even got Fables 19 off the shelves to see if I was just forgetting. 
 Anyway, I've enjoyed Unwritten. I think this was okay as an Unwritten outing. It's essentially Tommy in Fableland. It progressed his story a little. Unfortunately, I think it progressed his story at the expense of Fables. It had none of the humor or the emotion or the character moments I expect from Fables. Everyone was at their worst. Characters were killed right and left, even though many of them should have been near unkillable according to the rules of Fables (as long as your story is still being told...) 
 I'm left hoping that maybe this was Darkest Timeline Fables or something, and that the events of Camelot won't lead up to this, and it can be dismissed as something that happened to another version of the same characters, in another similar world. It gets two stars as a Fables book. Three at most as an Unwritten book. I would have thought the two would have combined better."
5,"""Dammit, Beth! Stop running from me!"" 
 My pulse hammers through my body. She's been running from me from the moment I met her. Not matter how hard I try to hold on to her, she finds a way to slip out of my grasp. 
 Not anymore. Not today.' 
 Dare you to make a move... 
 Ryan Stone and his friends are notorious for their crazy dares. The higher the stakes, the better the game. And no one enjoys the dares more than Ryan, the town's leading baseball jock and golden boy. He's competitive to a fault - losing is never an option. 
 Until the day he loses a dare. And that bad-ass chick with the black hair and piercings is to blame. One thing's for sure - Skater Girl's going down. 
 Dare you to take a stand... 
 Beth Risk's surname should be warning enough. Her life is like the lyrics to a Marilyn Manson in the flesh. With her pathetic addict mother, her mother's druggie boyfriend and the gritty, dangerous environment of the trailer park weighing upon her, Beth ends up in a situation she'd rather not be in. She's left with no other option then to move in with her baseball star uncle. 
 But some things can't be escaped no matter how far or fast you run. Like the past. 
 Dare you to give in... 
 Ryan gets the shock of his life to find out that Bulitt County High's newest student, Beth Risk, is not only the niece of his sport idol, but also the Skater Girl who he hasn't been able to shake from his mind since the failed dare. Determined to win the dare once and for all, Ryan does everything in his power to get close to Beth and to befriend her. 
 But as he begins to see the girl behind the tough facade, all thoughts of the dare leave his mind. The only dare he's interested in is the one to win Beth's heart. Except, in this dare, Ryan may have just met his match. 
 Dare you to open up... 
 Haunted by memories she can't forget, Beth doesn't want roots - doesn't want to settle down, doesn't want to start afresh. Befriending anyone would risk her independence. It would ruin everything she's worked for. But something inside of her rebels. Something kickstarts within her when she sees Ryan. 
 A part of her wants to give in. But if she falls, will he catch her? Or will Ryan let her down like everyone else she's ever loved? 
 Dare you to love... 
 The unlikeliest of allies. The unlikeliest of friends. The unlikeliest of loves. 
 Beth and Ryan will have to defy all odds to be together and to make things work. What starts as a dare slowly evolves into the most bittersweet of battles - the boy with the big heart and fierce will, versus the girl with the girl with the torn heart and fiery temper. 
 Place your bets. Roll the dice. Take the leap. Take the chance. 
 Come on; I dare you to."
3,"My son liked this book, mostly because he liked reading it as movie script. It is a visual story and works well in this format. I liked it because it is a young readers' title with an unreliable narrator. Most youth books don't take this risk, and it gives the reader a little more trust and responsibility in figuring what is really going on. Still, the story seemed simplified, both to fit the movie script format and also possibly not to overwhelm the reader. This would be a good title for a young reluctant urban reader. There are some issues that could lead to some very good group discussion, mostly dealing with truth vs survival, and anticipating our narrator's future. 
 October 2015 second read"
3,"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a fictional explanation for a set of vintage found photographs that are scattered throughout the book. I loved the idea of those photographs forming the story, and the author was quite creative in what he came up with, but I think the idea itself was better than the book that resulted. 
 In the book, a teenager watches his beloved grandfather die. His grandfather had always told him fanciful tales, and Jacob begins to wonder if they were just fanciful. In response to his grandfather's dying words, Jacob sets off for Wales with his father to uncover his grandfather's secrets. I did enjoy the book, but I did not find it to be a can't-put-it-down read. The teenaged narrator did not have a strong, well-formed personality, and I never like to reach the end of ""a novel"" only to discover that it is the first in a series. Still, it kept my attention and I do want to know what happens next, so I will read the next book when it is published. 
 Some libraries classify this as a young adult book, while others put it in adult fiction. It can be enjoyed by both teenagers and adults. If you like a quirky read, this is definitely worth a look."
4,"The writing is this book is very simple, occasionally overly simple, but I found myself excusing this slight flaw for two reasons. First, the narrator, Bruno, is nine years old. I guess that his age could be given as a good reason for the simple prose, and it does help create an authentic voice. Second, the story is so powerful and so well told that I would be ridiculously picky to hold some simple writing against it. Bruno's story begins in Berlin during World War II, and readers with the most basic knowledge of the time period should have no trouble filling in the gaps left by Bruno's naivete. To say more than that the story is a holocaust story through the eyes of a child would be to take all the beauty out of reading this book. It had an enormous effect on me, making me smile at the willingness of children to believe the best of people, making me despair at the cruelty that we as a species are capable of, and making me look at the holocaust in a whole new way. Although this book was written for young adult readers, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to any adult with an interest in Nazi Germany."
4,"If I'm honest, this is fading fast from my memory and if I had to describe what actually happened, I'm not sure I'd remember in a few months time. That being said, it was one of the best newer releases I've read in a while. I enjoyed the whole reading experience and couldn't put the book down for a couple of days, until I was finished. I loved the writing, pacing, characters, plot, all of it. The only thing that stops me from giving it 5 stars, is that I don't quite feel the same intensity of love just a couple of weeks later. Only time will tell how much of a long term favourite it will be."
4,"Classic sci fi that raises a lot of moral and philosophical questions about how people should act and react after an apocalyptic event, and how to go about rebuilding from there. Loved it."
5,"love it! i am dying for the next one.

5,"This is my favorite manga. 
 Now, I'm normally more of a 'watch the anime, fall in love, read the manga' type of person. There are three different manga series that I've started and adored otherwise - Eyeshield 21, Oyasumi Punpun, and this one. And wow is this a great one. 
 The story follows Shoyo Ishida. He's a kind of rambunctious, kind of horrible little kid who likes to mess around, jump off of bridges, get in fights. One day, a deaf girl joins their class, and Shoyo leads the class in bullying her. This first volume is mostly the original manga oneshot - it was originally a oneshot, and then was expanded - and shows their time in elementary school, ending with Shoyo in his last year of high school... and he's found Nishimiya again. 
 I really really really love this manga. It's so heartbreaking, and so good, and while we didn't get to see much of the super cute moments in this volume, I can't wait to get my hands on the next ones as they come out. I absolutely adore the characters, and the artwork, and just - everything. It shows absolute cruelty, but also kindness and wonder and just - everything. It's just amazing."
5,"OMG! SO MANY FEELINGS! 
 it was amazing! It made me laugh, cry (like big fat tears) it made me wanna punch ron in the facea few times, I wanted so bad to kill Bellatrix with my bare hands and stuff. 
 it's te fucking perfect closure for this serie. 
 But for mi it's really sad! (view spoiler)[ and im not just talking about fred, creevy, tonks and remus life taken away. Or the fact that little teddy was an orphan just a few days after being born. (hide spoiler)] 
 Harry potter books, have grown up with me all this years! Wthen I was eleven I asked my mom when was my hogwarts letter was going to arrive and she was like ""Pumpkin theres not such a thing like hogwarts, it's just a book"" but for me, Harry potter aren't just books. 
 The characters in the books are my family, the have grown up with me, they've learned with me, they teached my thing and I am not talking about the Wingardium Leviosa or the Expecto Patronum they have teach me that there is no stronger bound that friendship and that without kind of love we are nothing. They teach my about loyalty beyond everything. the teach me that love can protect us from the darkness. They teach me that sometimes family doesn't run in our veins is in the love we feel. 
 That and more is how much Ive learned from harry potter and I think every human being need to read this books, because theyr awesome Im twenty years old now and everytime I put eyes on the Harry Potter books I feel childish, I remember myself sitting in the couch besides de window with a hot chocolate mug in my hand reading for the first time Harry Potter and the Sorceres stone. Harry potter is a reminder that no matter how old you grow, you should never forget the magic of being a young girl readind by the window. 
 Im crying rigth now while I wrote this, this are the kind of feeling this produces me. 
 Im not talking just about Harry itself. It's for every character, for ron, hermione, remus, tonks, fred, george, Jinny, Neville, Mrs and Mr Weasley, Dombuldore, Dobby, Snape even the stupid unbridge."
4,"Oh, Noah... You made me cry. More than once. I'm upgrading you to my Top 10 book boyfriend list. 
 4.5/5 stars."
4,Well. That was definitely a haunting read.
4,"For the first 50 pages or so of this novel I had bad reading deja vu. It look me that long to realize that I had read this book when it first came out in 2009. When you read as much as I do you are bound to get a repeat sneek up on you every now and then. If they were all as good as this book then I wouldn't mind. 
 ""The Strain"" is about vampires. Not the 100 year old simmering virgin vampires who glitter in the sun or even the emo vampires trying to live a 'normal' human life the best they can. The vampires in this book are true Nosferatu. They are the embodiment of the stories our great-great grandparents were told around the family hearth back in the old country. These vampires are a plague on man. They are the things that go bump in the night and this book will scare you."
4,"While this wasn't a page-turner it was an extremely well-written and compelling book about what might happen if a man who died a century ago was reanimated. 
 Told from four different perspectives, I appreciated the quirks of each character and thought Kiernan did an outstanding job capturing the language of the 1900s."
3,"My rating for this is closer to a 3.5 or more. It could have easily been 4 stars or higher if it weren't for a few key scenes towards the end of the book that just kind of failed to tie it all together for me. I'm still thinking of giving it 4 stars just cause Lynch is really great at building his world and describing the cultures he's developed from culinary art, to clothing styles, alchemy etc. not to mention how elaborate like 70% of the book is. But in the end his descriptions of Locke's escapes just get more and more far-fetched. The three scenes that kind of ruined the book a bit for me were: 
 (view spoiler)[ 1. His original escape out of the tower during the revel was a bit ridiculous on multiple levels. First of all, we have the Spider, head of Camorr's spy network suddenly becoming woefully clueless once she's just caught and poisoned the state's most infamous thief. Her original plan to poison Locke was brilliant, but for some reason she doesn't think to have guards posted even outside the door as backup should something go wrong as she confronts, again, the most notorious thief in her city. Not only that but apparently all Locke needs to do is punch her in the face once and catch the antidote. That's not mentioning his ridiculous escape out the window. Honestly, that part of the escape could have worked, but I found that Lynch rushes through these types of scenes and is a bit sloppy with them. Its kind of strange when you consider how long he spends describing minute details of food, clothing, streets etc. or how elaborately planned the Salvara game was, or how the Interludes hooked back up with main storyline. He should have saved some of that elaborate planning for those major escapes that were meant to tie so much of the last half of the book together. 
 2. Not only is the description of Locke's escape from the revel a bit sloppy, but how he convinces Conte and then finally the Spider yet again about the statues and then convinces them to let him go after the statues are defused. I dunno, that whole scene was just a bit weird to me, although it was hilarious that he managed to convince them that the money was in those shit barges lol. 
 3. The final fight between Locke and the Grey King. I mean, come on...Locke is already a shit fighter. He knows that, we know that, the Grey King now knows that. The Grey King could have easily finished him off. It would have been better if once Locke latched on to the Grey King screaming that he just needs to hold on til Jean gets there that Jean actually showed up. I mean the scene seems a bit silly. Locke's arm is complete torn up, the Grey King's basically shattered his face and Locke's bleeding from every which way. Throwing a coin and then using the moment to stab the Grey King in the back just seems like grasping for a conclusion that doesn't see Locke dead. Might as well just go for the most likely scenario and have Jean show up to finish the Grey King off. 
 (hide spoiler)] 
 Again, this book is really hard to rate. I think I was mainly just disappointed because otherwise Lynch's descriptions and attention to detail were so elaborate and thorough...except when it came to those key scenes. It could easily be at least 4 stars otherwise though."
3,"I love this series and its great depictions of female friendship and entrepreneurship (and the romance duh). This is my least favorite of the four, as the romance feels the most forced. What I do love about it is the glimpses of Mal and Parker's chemistry, which is the topic of the last book Happy Ever After (and my ultimate favorite)."
3,"I liked this story but Stella, the main character, was just not a good character to anchor this story to. If this had been about Chet, who met a liar that was in WITSEC, it would have been much better, but alas, we cannot have everything we want. 
 3 stars"
4,"Very good love story with a wrong finally righted. Hugo Marshall a pugilist, who also does the dirty work for the Duke of Clermont, finally comes to his senses and more than helps the governess, Serena. The back and forth notes and letters between the two were my highlights. The quick wit and outright lust, left me wanting to more. I am looking forward to the next book, The Duchess War"

 For starters, you really have to read this series in order. You officially start with Beyond Shame, book #1, but if you want a smaller taste, you can read Beyond Solitude, which is #4.5, but stands alone really, really well. And I think you should read this series, because it's dark and gritty and really, really good. Oh, and it's really, really hot, too. 
 Trix has long been a background character in the O'Kane gang. She's a bartender and a dancer at their bar. At the end of book #4, Beyond Jealously, Trix gets kidnapped and taken to Sector 5, and we learn that's where she escaped from a life of a prostitute addicted to drugs. 
 Finn is an enforcer for Mac, the evil overlord of Sector 5. He actually lives just to undermine Mac, and has since Mac facilitated the overdose of Finn's favorite girl, Tracy. He doesn't care much about living or dying, but he knows Mac is horrible and he's working on a one man mission to ruin his rule over Sector 5. 
 That all changes when Finn is called into Mac's office and sees the newly kidnapped Trix. Trix is Tracy. She never really died, she escaped to Sector 4 and changed her name. Seeing Trix/Tracy spurs Finn to action like nothing else has, and Trix and Finn end up on the run. They've got a twisted history, since their prior relationship took place when Trix was hooked on drugs and Finn was her supplier - giving her the drugs in exchange for sex. They both had deeper feelings, but the addiction between them blurred everything. 
 So the question is never really whether Trix and Finn love each other, but it's how can they work through their history and issues together. This is complicated somewhat by Trix now being a member of the O'Kanes. That means Finn will have to find his way to a place in the gang. 
 The relationship between Trix and Finn was a strong point for me. I really enjoyed watching them find their way to each other with nothing between them. The sex scenes are scorching hot, as expected in this series. 
 Also as expected in this series there's a menage scene. That was a bit of a let down for me in this book. I was also surprised at how easily Finn was accepted as an O'Kane, especially given his history of working for Mac Fleming. Those were the only two week points in the book for me. 
 Besides Trix and Finn, I really enjoyed checking in with everyone else in the O'Kane gang. So awesome seeing Dallas and Lex truly sharing power. I'm also getting curious-er and curious-er about Doc (whose name is Dylan!). And what's up with him and Maddox? I want to go back and re-read the entire series, taking notes this time. I thought Maddox was paired up with someone. And then there's Lili from Sector 5. That's one messed up lady, so you know she's going to end up in Sector 4, hopefully getting some control over her life. She's right up Lex's alley. 
 So, if you're reading the series, who is your favorite character? I'm a huge Noah/Emma fan, but Maddox is probably the one I'm most curious about right now!"
5,ok those two books i read were so good ! i can't wait to see the other 2 alpha biker hot dudes !!!!

 See this review and more on my blog Lilybloombooks 
 1.5 stars 
 Honestly, I don't even know where to start with this book. Due to the fact that the few books I read before this one were awesome, I was hoping I would continue on my ""Good Book Roll"". Sadly, that is not the case. Falling for the Ghost of You could have been a great book, hell--even good, honest. But there are several different reasons why this it wasn't and just didn't work for me. The only thing going for it was its humor. There were parts that I legit laughed my butt off. The rest? No. 
 I'll start with the writing. It had this weird.. vibe to it (I'm really at a loss for words how to describe it). Like I was reading this girls diary vs living out the events with her. Considering that this wasn't the intention, it didn't work. It's very bland and underdeveloped. It was choppy and lacked even a decent flow-- it was just all over the place. To put it straight, it felt like the VERY first draft. Not only was I laughing at the funny parts, I was also laughing at the unbelievably ridiculous things that came about randomly and others that left a bad taste in my mouth. Violet being a best-selling author (to pay for her Mom's medical bills) and her,""Yeah, no big deal I'm just a bad ass"" attitude. The whole situation with her best friend and the relationship with her teacher. (view spoiler)[ This isn't something to just say, ""oh shit"" about a brush off. Nor is it in good taste to have her end up pregnant with all the nonchalance in the world. That is serious shit right there, people. (hide spoiler)]. The fact that Zane's ""secret"" was so unrealistic. (view spoiler)[ He is supposedly this very famous singer/actor. You are telling me that just changing hair color and contacts would keep the media in the dark? How about the fact that he was her FAVORITE singer and she didn't KNOW!? C'mon, now. Could you BE more dense? (hide spoiler)] The plot holes were so big it was unreal. 
 Violet is probably one of my least favorite protagonist, ever. For one, she is very immature and judgemental. Everyone was a slut, or a ho or a whore. Let me take a minute to point out that the one person that could be considered a ""slut"", was Zane. For the first week she stayed with him, he had a different girl/woman over every night. Did this thought cross her mind? Nope. I guess a ""hot body"" gives him a pass. She was a horrible friend. Sure, she gave her a car at the end but what about all that drama in between? She was so selfish and obsessed with her ""relationship"" with Zane, she couldn't see what was happening with her best friend. Speaking of; the ""romance"" was boring. I will admit, I did kind of like their banter in the beginning (VERY beginning) but once the feelings came into play, I just couldn't give a rats ass. It's always hard for me to believe that a guy that has a different woman over every night just gives that up for the girl. (Especially Violet). Did those women not know who he was, either?! I mean, let's be real here. 
 The ending was... sad. Not boo-hoo sad, but ""I didn't think things could possible get worse"" sad. My eyes were hurting from all the rolling. Honestly, I could go on and on about all the reasons why this book didn't work and all the things that were NOT OKAY. But I wont. 
 My Peeve~ I'm sure you could guess, but if not... pretty much the whole thing. The only reason why I didn't mark as DNF is because I needed a good laugh. 
 Overall~ I didn't like it. I wish I hadn't put this one on the poll and damn sure wish I hadn't ""purchased"" it. Thank goodness it was free. Sure, I was entertained by the humor and ridiculousness but this just proves that-- Some books are great; some books are good.. and some books are... not."
3,"An interesting idea - what if each time a soldier comes home everything changes? This is the story presented here but it is a reverse allegory of the Vietnam war experience the author had - each time he came home *he* was changed but the things around him weren't. 
 A pretty good read, but one I took slower due to the time complexities. The book ""City at the End of Time"" is somewhat similar, with a human being frozen and dragged out every few hundred/thousand/million years."
5,I really enjoy the way Pierce writes. It's plot is fantastic. I hope to see more of her works in the Tortall setting.
4,"If I was asked to sum up this book in two words I would say epic and stunning. Jess the main character secretly runs in the Fives but with an unlikely turn of events she may need to work for the man she despises the most. The concept of the Fives is what made me want to read this book. The players called adversaries race across a super intense obstacle course with the goal being to get to the victory tower first. Court of Fives is a whirlwind of action and deceit, but it was never overwhelming. The romance didn't really work for me. It didn't make sense until the end of the book and then I got why it needed to be there, but I wish it made more sense in the beginning because I felt like it distracted from the story. All in all it's a great read, the ending was perfect and I can't wait for the next book."
3,"2.5 rounded up. If seemed like it was going to be so good, but ended up just o.k. 
 A quick read that gives cause for a thoughtful pause, but also suggests the danger of falling into a ""what-if"" line of thinking. 
 I basically hated Jason by about 1/3 through, his obsessive one-dimensional search for Daniela didn't offer that much interest to me, or to the story in general. This was a shame, because after the box was introduced, this story could have gone anywhere- instead it turned out to be a cliche romance story -complete with a pretty awkward sex scene at the end.. 
 Perhaps I'm being too hard on this...we'll see after having a few days to think it over."
3,"Although The Miniaturist came with good recommendations, I overall couldn't decide if I liked the book or not. While I enjoyed some elements, others fell flat. 
 The setting is 1686 Amsterdam. We meet 18-year-old Nella Oortman, a girl from a smaller city, who is recently married in an arranged marriage to a rich merchant 20 years her senior, Johannes Brandt. The novel chronicles the first four months of her marriage to Johannes, where Nella lives with and gets to know Johannes, his unmarried sister, Marin, and their servants, Cornelia and Otto. As Nella slowly unravels the family's secrets, she keeps a few secrets of her own, which relate back to the craftsman she has hired to create miniature items for a cabinet house Johannes gifted her. The other major subplot features Johannes trying to sell a large amount of sugar on behalf of another rich merchant family. 
 The novel explores the themes of money, commerce, power, women's issues, family situations, sex and religion among the 1% of Amsterdam society at the time. 
 I enjoyed reading and learning about the historical context of some of those different issues, but I did not feel a deep connection to the characters. I had an especially hard time relating to Nella -- while I felt bad for her and the increasingly difficult events she faced in the book, she also came off to me as naive and spoiled, and it was not easy for me to like her as a character until closer to the end of the book. 
 I also thought that some of the dramatic plot developments seemed random and there just to shock, even though the suspense was built up before the developments quite well. Furthermore, one of the most major and mysterious subplots was left extremely open and ambiguous at the end of the novel, which felt very dissatisfying to me. 
 Overall, if you like historical fiction, I'd give The Miniaturist a go. However, while the plot is vast, historically interesting, and at times salacious, it didn't do much for me in terms of a truly satisfying story. 
 (p.s.: There are historical notes at both the beginning and the end of the book; I wish I had read both before the novel instead of reading the endnotes at, well, the end. It might be worth flipping to the back to check out the glossary and other info before you start reading.)"
4,"3 1/2 stars, I needed something sweet after the last book I read and this one hit the spot. Lily got the shock of her life when her mom knocked on her door to tell her her sister died, and that the father of her nephew John Warren who everyone knew hurt her sister was going to take the baby. With her mom's help Lily left and moved to her cousin Tessa's(the heroine from book one) town. Being offered the bar tending job at the MC Lily accepts knowing she need the money now more than ever. On her first day Lily meets Goliath. The second he see's Lily Goliath wants her but he doesn't want her working anywhere near the club and all the members, trying to get his way Goliath makes a huge impression on Lily, and it's bad. 
 Even though Goliath is the most attractive man Lily has ever scene he's a jerk but working at the club Lily see's him a lot and soon the attraction it too much for either to deny. As Lily gets the hang of raising her nephew she and Goliath begin to fall in love, and they both think that they may have found their future in each other but a new club is trying to move in the MC's territory and they plan to take over. When tragedy strikes Lily's nephew's father comes with a very different story than Lily was told and it may end with John Warren leaving with his father for good. 
 This is a sweet light MC book with insta-love, by a possessive biker. I really liked Goliath and Lily, this story had a lot to it but at it's core it was a sweet simple romance between a man and woman who are falling in love and learning to raise the little boy. It all gets wrapped up nicely and we are given great glimpse into the next book. I do wish the situation with John Warrens biological father, Lily's father, and her mother had been explained more, and that more time had been taken to delve into those story lines. Some things in this story were rushed a little too much as well as tied up a little too easily without enough explanation. But overall this was a really nice sweet MC read."
4,"I will admit that I was hesitant about starting this book. Everyone said it was amazing, but it isn't within my typical genre. I started the book last night, however, and now I've finished it. It was phenomenal. 
 The book held my attention the entire way through, and that isn't always the case with books. I really loved Jonas and The Giver, neither one angered me like many protagonists do. The way they interacted was wonderful, and I kind of fell in love with the old man. I found myself wishing I could meet him. 
 Lowry did a spectacular job of creating a world that is both functional and horrible at the same time. I do have questions about the Sameness, though. Like how did it come to be? Do these people have genetic defects that make it impossible for them to see color or feel love? I would like that explained in more detail. 
 Overall, 5 stars!"
4,"Reader, beware. The ending of this book will stab you in the eye and giggle at your pain. Holy crud on a cracker. 
 I didn't even particularly like the characters. I wasn't interested in Vix while reading Mistress of Rome, and I didn't understand his decision to return to Rome at all. Vix kind of seems like a dingbat. 
 Dislike of fictional warriors aside, the book itself was very interesting. I was fascinated by all the goings-on and the plotting and treachery and holy crap the twisted ending of doom. Kate Quinn is a fantastic writer. I am bummed she hasn't written twenty more books for me to sink my teeth into, STAT."
4,"After seeing countless reviews that claimed that Allegiant had ruined the series for readers and having a pivotal scene spoiled for me courtesy of Facebook friends who don't understand that not everyone was able to read it on the release date, I was a bit nervous about starting this book. After finishing, it seems as though I'm a black sheep on this one: Allegiant took me on an emotional roller coaster ride, but it was one that I certainly enjoyed. 
 The narration in Allegiant is told from two perspectives: Tris and Four's. A lot of other reviews have complained about how ""weak"" Four appears in this book, but I see it as the complete opposite; after getting a glimpse into Four's head, it's clear that he must be strong to shoulder all of his burdens and demons by himself. I really enjoyed getting a glimpse at his motivations and deep-rooted insecurities as they served to make him more real. While I did enjoy the dual POV and understand its necessity, Tris and Four's voices were often indistinguishable, to the point where I occasionally had to flip back and see whose perspective I was reading from. It didn't take away from my reading experience by any means, but I do wish that there was tighter writing in some places to give Four a distinct voice. 
 I loved Roth's exploration of all of the characters, and how well fleshed out they were. Grief, loss, and desperation have changed them all from the characters that we first met in Divergent and I felt for all of them - including Caleb, which was a bit of a surprise for me. 
 The plot was well-paced and interesting, though a few parts at the beginning seemed to consist mostly of info-dumping. This did cause the beginning to feel rather slow, but this information was necessary to put the final touches on the world-building. There's so much going on in Allegiant, multiple threads of a storyline that are all building up to one big event: the climax. Roth holds nothing back as the characters are tested and caused to question their morals and beliefs. She doesn't write the ending that the reader wants; instead, she writes the story that needs to be told. It's a heartbreaking yet beautiful finish and, in my opinion, is the only way that this series could have authentically ended. 
 -- 
 As a sidenote, if you've finished reading Allegiant, you should take a look at Veronica Roth's blog post regarding why the series ended the way that it did. It's a beautiful explanation.

5,"""Let the sandcastle collapse. In its place, I will build a fortress-- one that the waves of nature and time could never destroy."" 
 The best book in this series so far! I can't seem to get enough of this series. This was a very well written book with many great twists to the story. I loved how the characters developed through out the book."

3,"Overall, this was an enjoyable fantasy story. 
 Pros: 
 1. This fantasy story was pretty good. Two rogues are unwilling heroes. They have to save kingdoms and fight monsters to save a village. 
 2. It gets quite dark and bloody in some parts, which I liked. People die. It ups the stakes. 
 3. A good, clean read. Rare these days. 
 4. Battles, journeys, wizardry and (view spoiler)[ a dragon-like creature (hide spoiler)] 
 Cons: 
 1. The writing was not exceptional. At one point a character is glad his friend's excessive bleeding is bright red ""since it's better than dark red"", which is according to them more fatal. Not so. Bright red means an artery has been severed and is in fact more life-threatening. Bright red means the blood is oxygen-rich and has just come from the heart and is being pumped with more force. 
 2. The climax of the book could have been better. My main issue was with (view spoiler)[ the lack of description when Thrace goes to kill the beast. It is not clearly described, no ""it snorted in frustration and its breath blasted back her hair"", no ""its claws raked the earth, sending up puffs of ash and dust"", no ""fire glinted off the black scales on its snout as it..."". (hide spoiler)] Just utter vagueness. (view spoiler)[ We don't even get to see WHERE she strikes him. (hide spoiler)] 
 Other than some minor issues with pacing and writing, it was a good, memorable story."
5,"I'm speechless. This book was truly amazing and such a pleasure to read. I read a lot of books each year, but very few stay in my memory as this one will. It's written so accurately to the feelings of Finch and Violet, it describes so well what both of them are going through... I recommend it to everyone, truly: you deserve a book like this."
3,"It needs a trilogy. ABSOLUTE LOVEEEEEEEEEEEE!! BUT I HATED THE Eddie and the sister in law, nuuh . it cant be finished anyways"
3,"While it's fascinating to see how the world of Wool came to be, I also found it a little horrifying. Learning how the silos were created made it much more ""real,"" more plausible. More possible. Shift showed how ordinary people can decide the fate of so many. By the end, the reality of the plan is beyond what a sane person might consider, and so actually less terrifying, though Daniel was plenty horrified. But I found myself uneasy with how logically and systematically it was all planned out. 
 The story switched back and forth as lot between times until the different timelines came together. Even more so than in Wool. It was a little jarring. I did like how timelines merged with Wool, though near the end of Shift, I wasn't sure whether they were in the same time frame or not. 
 And while the switching in time felt jarring, following Donald through time, watching his struggles, felt very real to me. Even though he was in a position I've never been in, and hopefully never will be, I could understand him. 
 There was a bit less tension, fewer high points where the suspense ratcheted to a peak. It was more like a slow build, but still enough to keep me reading. The next book promises to be something altogether different. I'm anxious to find out how this ends."
4,"Man, I really love Holly B's writing. The story is fun, original and imaginative but it still maintains that creeping sense of something dark and wicked. As a stand alone the story is magnificent but not perfect. 
 The characters could definitely use some work, but given the length of the novel I can understand this ussue.Some of the characters were better developed, like Jack, hes awsome.....the rest not as much.But at least they dont suck. 
 The story itself is the kind if magical fun that reminds you if fairytales. 
 They loved him because he was a prince and a faerie and magical and you were supposed to love princes and faeries and magical people."" 
 Isn't there something irresistiblely cute about things like that. 
 I think there is but that also means that even though Holly incorporated that creepy vibe into the writing, the story itself is relatively light hearted.Its like a mature version of the ultimate childhood adventure. 
 You have the action, the romance and some cool twists set in a believable urban setting, but its a fairytale at heart.Once you wrap your head around that the book is wickedly enjoyable."
1,"Racist, boring, and a very unsatisfying conclusion to the series. When I read this in 6th grade, I was like, ""WTF?!"" Now I'm like, ""WTF?!"" 
 At least this series proved that in some ways, I have not changed from Young Me."
5,"THE SECOND BOOK OF ME BEFORE YOU! I was absolutely CRAZY excited to get this book because Me Before You was one of the best books I have ever read. Unfortunately, I think my expectations were set a bit too high and I was still quite connected to Will. 
 Louisa goes through grief and guilt and Jojo Moyes is able to depict a very realistic kind of fiction. After You was really able to show how people move on and at the same time how deeply others can affect you. 
 In this novel Louisa meets two new people who impact her life in ways she never could have imagined, both bring trouble but also eventual happiness. First she meets Sam. Someone she never saw coming and takes a part of her heart. Next, she meets Lily. I don't want to spoil anything so let's just say Lily is exactly what Lou needed after Will. 
 Lou goes through a LOT of ups and downs (and one literal down too). Jojo Moyes is really able to capture Lou's feelings and inner battles. The book was incredibly written and as usual be prepared for emotions galore!

5,"** spoiler alert ** 
 This book hit me with so many feels. All of the ships I wanted sailed, and everything ended in a way that I was happy with. BUT ALL THE CROSSOVERS! Tessa and Jem! I cried during that epilogue, but not like how I cried during Clockwork Princess. This series is and will always be one of my favorites, though The Infernal Devices still reigns supreme."
0,"This book. Oh my god this book. I love it. I love how Ms. Ee had funny moments and disturbing moments. I never thought that would be a good mix, but it is. Read. This. Book."
2,"2/5 stars 
 Hanging by the Thread tried to have a somewhat unique concept. The main character Clare is sorta a physic detective. Only she doesn't get her visions of the future, she gets visions of the past...from vintage clothing. For me, this concept didn't work. There's a whole story about how it was passed down in her family because a dress-making ancestor was murdered. But to me, getting flashes when you touch someone's t-shirt but not when you touch the person, just seems odd. 
 Of course Clare likes to design repurposed fashion. There wouldn't be much of a plot if she wasn't into used clothing would there? Rather than being an oddball, like most people who make their own clothes in high school, she is embraced by the popular crowd as their personal seamstress. She goes to beach party, flirts with boys and adds losing her virginity to her summer to do list. Because Clare is such a fashion maven, the reader is treated to long unnecessary description of everything that everyone wears. 
 A lot of things about this novel didn't work. The main character falls in insta-love with another character after an angry encounter on the beach which led to a make-out sessions. This is the second time they've met, and he immediately starts confessing his personal life problems to Clare. The relationship lacked any real development. It went from ""oh he's cute"" to ""oh we're kissing"" to ""oh let me tell you about my dead father"" in literally two encounters. 
 The whole plot of this novel revolves around two murders on consecutive July 3rds. With the anniversary looming, the town is gossiping about the possibility of a serial killer and another murder. When a junk-sale jacket starts speaking to Clare, she feels like she's meant to solve the 2 year old crime. 
 Her way of solving it seems to be making out with a guy, talking to her best friend, driving up a fire service road with someone that she barely knows (real safe there!) and breaking into someone's house. For the record, I hate when people try to solve crimes on their own without a logical reason. It's stupid and dangerous! This book tried to explain it, using an awkwardly placed scene where a police officer made her pick up litter. Clearly they are incompetent! Or they just hate litter... 
 Some books are just shallow. The storyline, the relationships, the characters don't have the depth that a novel needs to be compelling. This is one of those stories. 
 An ARC was provided by the publisher via netgalley."
3,"For the sake that it is part of the VA world, and it's written by Richelle, I read it. But my god it took me F O R E V E R to get through it. Those who follow me on twitter know this because I spent a few tweets ranting on how boring certain parts were. BUT, people kept assuring me that it would get better and to pull through because it gets better. Well, it sorta does? 
 I mean Adrian is probably the main reason I stuck it out. His sass and wit are something I can never get enough of so I was vastly entertained by that. The basic plot of this new series seems to be all over the place at times what with magic tattoos, vampire hunters, bad alchemists, something special with Sydney, something special in those restored by spirit..oy. Maybe too many different plot lines that just ended up boring me. But once you get into the action then it starts to get good! 
 And, honestly, the romance between Sydney and Adrian is so perfect. I mean, at first it put me off because I was still on the whole ""Adrian loves Rose"" (even though it wasn't my OTP, I still shipped it? if that makes sense..) So when I read this and found he was falling for Sage I was a bit like ""mm, no don't like."" BUT. When I see the feelings and the love between Sydney and Adrian and then I see the love Adrian had for Rose, I can see how they are both completely different. I can also see how Sydney does in fact make Adrian a better person. SO, I have joined the Sydrian fanclub. 
 For that, I give 3 stars. 
 Other than that, I was a tad bored with this book."
2,"To borrow a word from Andrew Smith and Grasshopper Jungle - ""Um."" Yeah. It was a bit of a struggle for me to get through this book. And I almost feel bad about rating it because it is a case where the rating is a 100% reflection of my own feelings on the book and nothing to do with anything else (quality of writing, originality, etc.). It was just not a book for me. And that kills me because Winger is one of my favorite books. There was just too much repetition in this one, too much talk of semen, too much gore. It was full of wierd shit and I just didn't care about how everything connected to want to hear about it over and over again. I feel bad about my low rating because I know this is a book that other people love. My guess is that you will either love it for its originality and look at one teenage boy's coming of age story or you will hate it for its writing style and crudeness. If the book interests you, I encourage you to give it a try. If you're picking this up because you liked Winger and think this might be similar, just put it down and don't look back. Move on to something else. I promise. Good luck. Eden needs you."
3,I was not a fan of this book the first 200 pages but once I got past the stupid conspiracy type issues (that I cannot see most teens even understanding) and the book became more about the action it was decent. Through out the book the little side notes are tedious and rarely funny along with all the pop culture references which are relevant now but in a year or two not so much.
5,"*Sigh* This was such an awesome read. 
 Go with your heart. Let me prove to your head that your heart made the right choice 
 I really enjoyed this book. At the very first scene I was a little confused about what was going on but I was soon glued to my kindle and quickly devoured the rest of the book. The story didn't follow the typical YA/NA recipe which I really liked - there were no silly love triangles or silly misunderstandings. When I hit the 20% mark I genuinely did NOT expect what happened to happen! (view spoiler)[I assumed that there would be the typical love triangle and that Emily would turn out to be a right bitch (hide spoiler)] I knew from then on that the story would definitely not go the way I expected it to. I loved the silent exchanges between Zack and Nikki in the beginning and then their steamy romance scenes later on. Ashley, Nikki's best friend, was fiercely protective of her friend and would beat up anyone that tried to hurt her - I love reading stories where the heroine has a friend like that. 
 One of the things I didn't like about the book were the time leaps and the missing scenes during them. Without giving too much away, In one particular leap (6 or 7 weeks) Zack and Nikki's relationship had developed quite a bit during this time and I felt it would have been better to see some of that development rather than just jumping straight to them getting naked. It felt like a few chunks of the book were missing. (view spoiler)[Another thing I would have liked to have seen is how Nikki's new found relationship with her dad started. It was so nice that he tried so hard to keep seeing her as a child even though Nikki's mum (mom) didn't like it (hide spoiler)] 
 I always knew home wasn't a place, I just didn't know I could find it with a person who would be so deeply ravelled in my life before we ever met 
 This line in particular put a really big sappy grin on my face and really sums up the story quite well :D 
 Overall I really enjoyed this book and I plan to read more of the authors books in the future :D Belong to You is already on my Kindle waiting to be read! 
 ARC received in exchange for an honest review :D"
5,"""Never Love a Highlander"" is my most favorite part of the series. I just love Caelen and his warrior princess Rionna. She was so badass. Of course, in the beginning, Caelen struggled a bit with the fact that his wife was different. He didn't accept her love for swordplay. He thought it unseemly for a woman and worried that she could get hurt. It took him some time to accept who Rionna is. 
 I loved the plot development. It was great to see how the McDonald clan slowly came to acknowledge Caelen as their new laird. And I also liked how Caelen and Rionna's relationship developed. 
 Fans of hurt/comfort will love to hear that in this last part, as in the previous parts, there were a few thrilling hurt/comfort scenes. 
 The ending was satisfying and so very lovely. 
 ""The McCabe Trilogy"" is a wonderful series and a great read to keep you entertained for a few hours. 
 Now, I only wish Maya Banks would write more in this universe. Gannon, Crispen and his little friend Gretchen, Isabel, Caelen and Rionna's child - they all need their own story. :) I would be happy to read them."
4,"This is really more of a 3.5 stars, but it was entertaining. Felt a bit like an HG Wells book."
4,review to come.
3,"A quick fun read, not too taxing! Perfect for chilling out in the sun."
3,"What an atmospheric, thematic novel this was. So unique, like nothing I've read before. I think I would have rated it higher had I read it quicker - but it took me over a month to read, which made it overwhelming and confusing when I'd pick it up again. Still a very original tale, highly engrossing, but confusing at times. 
 Borrowed from the lovely Alice."
1,"While itching for the next Mary Russell & Sherlock Holmes novel to arrive at my library, I thought I might check out the source material for the first time. I found this free audiobook on youtube! The voice actor was good too. 
 The Watson and Holmes part of the story is quite fun, but at the instant the villain is caught, the momentum is stopped dead by the ponderous, bloated backstory that is suddenly dropped into the narrative and takes up perhaps 25% of the text. I don't know how any reader could not have found this maddening. Actually, at first I was totally confused and thought there must be some mistake--that the first story was missing its ending and the author was now starting a completely different story. Philip had to keep telling me that no, this was going to explain the original mystery... eventually... an hour later. 
 This is a perfect example of why I don't read classics. No novel today would destroy its own pacing that way. Yes, the classics have their place, we stand on the shoulders of giants, etc etc, but books are better now. 
 Edited to add: Upon ruminating, I have docked it another star for failing to pass judgment on the character of Jefferson Hope, for abandoning his betrothed after she was forced into marriage with another. I do not condone the idea that a woman is worthless without her virginity. Sure, after her death, Hope dedicated his life to revenge on her killers and considered himself righteous in the eyes of God--but (someone, anyone, should have asked) why didn't he rescue her before she died?"
4,"I liked Red Country more than Best Served Cold, but less than The Heroes and the First Law Trilogy. I think Red Country's plot felt less urgent than Abercrombie's other books--less incipient mayhem, less immediate peril (for example, the fencing match between Jezal and the guy with the girly voice in the First Law trilogy? Edge of my seat. It felt like there was so much at stake. The Northman brawl over (view spoiler)[the ownership of Crease (hide spoiler)]? Meh). 
 Sometimes I think I wish that he'd do less scenes from other viewpoints, because that destroys the surprise when one of the characters does a 180 and sells the others out. On the other hand, it allows him to flesh out many minor characters in a way that would be impossible otherwise. You see, one of the things I like about Abercrombie's novels is that the characters are all so clearly existing in their own heads. It would be difficult to get a good sense of the more minor characters' motivations and feelings if we had to be dependent on what was going on in the major characters' solipsistic craniums. 
 I love Logan. My relationship to ice cream is rather like his relationship to violence, so I can relate! Once I start eating ice cream, it's difficult to stop no matter how much I should. Once Logan starts creating mayhem, it's difficult to stop until all the noisy fleshy things stop moving. 
 Ok. Not equivalent. But still, I have a warm place in my heart for the poor bastard."
2,"2 Stars 
 So when I initially reviewed this book I gave it 3 stars but I think it may have been due to my excitement for having new Harry Potter content blinded me to the problems that were around this book. Now that it's been out for quite a few months and the more that I've been sitting with it and recalling elements of the story have me irked to the point where I had to knock my rating down a whole star. 
 I will say that diving back into this world that I've grown up with overwhelmed me with so many feelings of happiness and nostalgia and I just couldn't get over the fact that it was finally here and that I was reading new Harry Potter content. The Malfoys were a huge redeeming quality for me, I don't think this play would have received even 2 stars had the characterization of Draco and Scorpius been included. Scorpius was an incredible character and he was the best part of this play for me. (view spoiler)[Also, the redemption of Draco was EXACTLY what I had been craving. I absolutely adored that we got to finally see some character development of Draco, that was something that I had been wanting for so long after finishing the Deathly Hallows. (hide spoiler)] 
 But the fact of the matter is, and it may have been my biggest gripe with the play in its entirety, is that it just didn't 
 feel 
 like Harry Potter to me. I know that Jo herself didn't write it, and that was incredibly prevalent to me while I was reading it. The characters I was reading did not feel like like the characters that I have loved for so many years. Abusive characters were romanticized and the amount of inconsistencies in this play were covered up by too many convenient solutions. (view spoiler)[I felt that a severe amount of queerbaiting took place right from the beginning of the story between Scorpius and Albus, I was so excited to finally see a queer romance take place within the universe and the fact that it was taken away right at the end was absolutely infuriating (hide spoiler)] 
 I will link the video to my review once I have it filmed and uploaded because I could definitely go on for ages about this. All in all, there were some things I liked about this play but in its entirey, I did not enjoy it."
5,"By the time I finished the first chapter, I was really debating why other people seemed to rave about it. The MC, Samantha, and her friends were just so shallow and annoying. Why should I care whether she lived or died? But, I turned the page and got sucked into Oliver's beautiful writing. She illuminates just a little more of the characters and their motivations with each day that Samantha relives, and yes, the book is similar to Groundhog Day in that she is stuck reliving the same day until she learns what she needs to do to stop it. The plot is an examination of the repercussions over time of our actions and of life and death with an ending that is haunting."
5,"Another 5 star book for this series. Where do I even begin with this one? Well first of all, I've been reading a lot of books lately that have alternating POVs, some of them work, some of them don't work quite as well. The dual POVs in The Fiery Heart work fantastically. I never forgot whether I was in Adrian's head or Sydney's, they have their own unique voices and it really adds something to the story to get both of their perspectives. Now onto spoilers. 
 (view spoiler)[I knew basically from the beginning of this series that eventually Sydney would be taken to a re-education center by the Alchemists, it's been her biggest fear for so long that I know someday it would become a reality. Especially when Zoe was put into the mix, I figured she'd have something to do with it. I know people don't like Zoe, and I obviously wasn't her biggest fan after reading this book, but I don't see how anyone can believe she's inherently evil or whatever. She's pretty much just like Sydney when we first met her. She's been brainwashed by the Alchemists and their mega-douche father. We saw her start to warm up at least to the dhampirs and I think given more time she could come around. Maybe she'll end up helping Adrian and the gang rescue Sydney. I would like to see that, because I don't think she's a bad person. She's just a kid who's been trained to think a certain way her whole life, those preconceived notions aren't going to disappear because one dhampir gives her driving lessons. 
 I was so glad to see some of our old friends from Vampire Academy in this book. Especially Christian. And Lissa. I still find myself bitter towards Rose after Last Sacrifice but considering Adrian is over it and has moved on, I probably should too. But my issues with Rose in Last Sacrifice are for another discussion. I loved seeing them all work together to develop the Strigoi anti-serum or whatever you want to call it. I hope we see more of them in Silver Shadows. Also oh my god how funny was it when Wolfe and Ms. Terwilliger got together? I was dying when they were first flirting in the coffee shop. So funny. I know I'm jumping all over the place but I'm so sad about Hopper! I hope somehow they can bring him back soon. Adrian and Sydney were so adorable in this book, too. I'm glad they got some of those happy moments together before everything went to crap. I admit it I really did ship Rose and Adrian in VA but I'm so glad Adrian found someone who believes in him and loves him 100% and also someone who inspires him to better himself. He wants to go to college and stop drinking and smoking not to impress Sydney, but because her love makes him want to be a better person. And that's beautiful. They really do compliment each other so well. 
 So in conclusion I loved this book as I've loved every other book in the series. I know Sydney can fight the Alchemists and that Adrian and everyone will find a way to get her out. If Rose could get sprung out of a Moroi prison, Sydney can get out of an Alchemist facility. And get out before they can brainwash her, I don't need another Peeta situation on my hands. I cant handle it! (hide spoiler)]"
5,Loved it!!
3,"Whilst this is listed as the third book in a series, I was unaware of that when I loaned it from the library. I'm glad I did as this could have easily been a standalone book. The last book I read that was even remotely like this was 50 Shades (the amount of sex rather than the BDSM obvs) so I probably compared the two more than I should have done. However, this was the better book of the two. Calla was actually a believable virgin which I liked. Jax would've been my book boyf if I wasn't 30+ and married (cos that would be weird right?) and the friends Calla has both new and old are the friends I wish I had had when I was her age. All in all, I enjoyed the book and congratulate the author. I won't however actively seek out more of the authors books simply because I don't need to read about sex ;)"
4,"3 1/2 stars. I didn't really like all the stupid decisions Reed made in this story, hell half the crap that happened could have been avoided had he not been so stupid. It was as if his IQ dropped in this book. Made his character less enjoyable. I did like that we got to see his side of the story, but still the book could have been better had he not been made out to be so stupid"
4,AMAZING Read!!
4,"A secret society involving book lovers - I wish I could join! All through this novel, I wondered what was grounded in fact and what was pure fantasy, but in the end, it really didn't matter. The mix of old knowledge and high-tech methods was well done and a wonder to behold. The characters were often quirky, sometimes singly focused, mostly mysterious, but always well defined. A plot that stretches back in time, it rushes forward to an end that surprises you when you finally get there and leaves you wondering, like the old song, ""Is that all there is?"" Still, you won't be sorry you invested the time to read this book, only that bookstores like this don't exist. (Or maybe they do . . . ?)"
4,"It's official, I'm a sap. I cried when the school asked the janitor if he could invite the children back for another day."
3,"I won the ARC in a Goodreads giveaway. I honestly didn't realize it was part of a series until I was just about to read it. The description was what drew me in, and, to be honest, I don't usually look at reviews before entering giveaways. It works fairly well as a standalone, with most of the past explained well enough that I wasn't completely confused...but left me wanting to know a bit more. I may not read the others in the series but at least I know my questions can be answered. 
 In post-WWI London, a woman named Maisie Dobbs is a former war nurse who now works with Scotland Yard as a detective. She lives with a man named James (which I didn't realize was even ""allowed"" for 1933??? And she's taken seriously too, which floors me in a good way) who she's still uncertain about marrying. First she wants to travel to India-something that she decides upon before taking on this last case with her colleagues Billy and Sandra. 
 An Indian woman named Usha Pramal is found dead with a gunshot wound to the head. Two months later, her brother comes to the city and requests the aid of a good detective. Maisie is called to the case. When her friend Maya is killed before being able to talk to Maisie, the case map is taken out (I love the idea of case maps, and always find them terribly interesting) and connections are drawn. 
 [spoiler]I learned more about ayahs and how they were treated; I learned that headstrong women in 1933 could seriously hold their own jobs (at least on London) and have some pull; I learned that we rely on doctors even more these days, and using natural herbs even then was nearly considered voodoo-ish. Maisie deals with the Paiges, who take in former ayahs and other Indian women who need a place to stay, but who don't always approach things with a pure Christian mindset. At first I suspected Mrs. Paige at least, but she's just a nervous women. And I am very glad that the pastor wasn't [completely] at fault either. 
 At first I thought that there was magic involved, but it's about intuition, determination, knowing nature's soothing and healing balms, and a sharp eye. 
 There were a few typos, which makes sense as I have an uncorrected proof.[/spoiler] 
 What I really enjoyed is the constant reminder that a loving heart will always draw people near. That is key in living a happy life. 
 And the description of the saris, how they're beautiful to look at - There is an Indian couple in my church and I think the same thing almost every week when I see the woman. They have beautiful patterns, colors and fabrics."
5,"This is my sixth reading. It is interesting how different it is to sit down and read a book that just flows. I started reading this morning and only stopped to eat. Ian is my favorite hero. This book is Jennifer Ashley's masterpiece in my opinion, on the same shelf as Loretta Chase's Lord of Scoundrels. 
 I remember the first time I read it; I wondered, how is she going to get a hero to fall in love with the heroine when he can't even read facial expressions and understand humor. His memory is perfect but he struggles with emotions. He cannot lie. 
 The story is refreshing because it skips all the social inanities due to Ian's condition and gives a peek at what a relationship can be like if it is truly straightforward. 
 You will struggle not to cry when Ian realizes that he loves Beth and how he knows he loves her. 
 My paperback copy is falling apart."
4,Technically a reread. I read this book 4 or 5 years ago and I do remember liking it. I still like the whole story. Definitely not a typical romantic read and the life lessons are a great bonus.
4,"Just like the song... When you get knocked down... You get up again. This book is about Kit getting back up and kicking some ass! 
 Go Kit! 
 Enjoyed this book as it did not shy away from the abuse that Kit suffered in the second book. Most books can just gloss over the emotional baggage that is a result of the bad stuff that can happen. I liked that we got to share her journey with her instead of just being told I'm fine and moved on. Now for book 4!"
4,"I want to make this review spoiler free so it might be pretty vague. 
 So, basically, this dome comes down around this town and the entire book is a look at how people react. I think the dome could have happened in any city in the world and the result would have been close to the same. Under the Dome was a look at the human condition. 
 The book was crazy long. I listened to it on audio and I think it was 35 hours long. The good thing about that is you really get to know all the characters. There seemed to be some filler but I think that is just how King writes. 
 There was someone that I absolutely hated, he will go down as one of the worst in my opinion. He almost ruined the book for me but I wanted to know what happened so I kept listening. Oh, and the audio was fantastic on this. I could have read faster, but I'm happy I listened."
4,I love Marjane Satrapi. She is awesome. And this book is awesome. Great sense of humour. Satrapi is my kind of girl. I will add her to my friends on facebook.
4,"Pat pat on the back for me, for having finished this book so quickly. 
 But then, the merit is not mine. 
 The merit is Ishiguro's, because he wrote a book in which not much happens, yet nevertheless you will risk the wrath of Mommy by getting ten minutes late to dinner because you simply could not put the book down. The perfect characters, and the perfect way that the story unfolds leaves the reader satisfied, yet not bloated. (I admit to preferring the bloating kind of meal, for example, I am a fan of Gone with the Wind and Jane Eyre and all those melodramas.) 
 Therefore, pat pat on the back for you, Mr. Ishiguro. 
 PS. I find myself infected by the butler's fine manner of writing. Noice."
4,"Lots of fun. Surprisingly violent for a JF, but lots of action and pretty funny, too. The audiobook was great- I don't know how much of my enjoyment came from the narrator as much as from the story itself."
0,"I *wish* I'd written anything beyond the fact that it's YA, I listened to it, and rated it 2.5. I kind of remember the story - a bit - but not what didn't work, though I remember its not working quite considerably. Well, yes, if I rated it 2.5, but I remember a bit of the cranky too!"
5,"4.5 stars 
 ""Yep, that pretty much describes my life: because Poseidon."" 
 Oh Rick Riordan, when will you write a terrible book? Probably never. The Hidden Oracle follows Apollo as he's turned into a teenager as a punishment. He has to serve someone until he faces several trials before he's released. This has happened before, so Apollo is optimistic that his few years of servitude will pass quickly and he'll be back to being his godly self. Expect it may not be as simple this time. 
 What I LOVED most about this book was the writing style. We all know Riordan is incredibly talented in writing middle grade fiction, so it's no surprise that this book follows in the same vein as its predecessors. He doesn't simplify the story or writing, but everything is conveyed clearly with a lot of humor. Apollo is a great character. He's funny (even when he isn't trying to be), selfish, intuitive, and insightful, but most of all he's ridiculous. Reading from his perspective is what makes this book so fun and enjoyable. 
 The Hidden Oracle is action packed. From the first page to the last there isn't a slow moment. The story is jumping from one plot point to the next. It's for this reason I gave this book 4.5 stars instead of 5. Important information about the plot is revealed then the story continues to the next action packed sequence. There was no pause to digest the information, which would have been appreciated. 
 The infamous Percy Jackson makes an appearance and it was fantastic. Anytime Percy makes an appearance is welcomed. It always reminds me how much I miss his character. The only complaint I have is I wish he was in the story more, but I understand it's not his story just in his world. 
 Overall, The Hidden Oracle is a fun thrill ride that will keep you glued to the book and laughing the entire time. I cannot wait for the sequel!"
3,i like how shes the man movie was based on this
5,"I knew since the moment I saw the cover (without reading synopsis) that I'll love this book. 
 If you haven't read it yet, what are you waiting for? I promise you're gonna find a real villain here, a SUPER plot twist, and lovely, kick-ass and well-made characters."
5,"This is a quiet book, not a lot of action. It won't be everyone's cup of tea, but I loved it. It's contemplative, a study in both introspection and relationships. John Ames is a minister nearing the end of his life, and he writes letters to his young son to read someday, exploring such topics as small town life, war, eccentric grandfathers, atheist brothers, prodigal sons, and many observations on nature, theology, and life in general (""Being""). It's kept me thinking."

 *4.5 star rating* 
 Holy footballs. Yes, my friends, this book is weird. Yes, it comes with a twist and is debatable for some people. Yes, I told my friends about it and they were a little scarred by the concept. Yes, you need to read it. Yes, I adored it. Laurie Elizabeth Flynn had me hooked into reading this book from the moment when I spotted the cover for the first time on Goodreads, ages ago. This is a book that touches upon all of the concepts and themes that many Young Adult fiction authors are afraid of touching upon on today, in our prejudicial, judgmental society: feminism, sex, first love and absolute rawness. I would be lying if I said that Firsts wasn't amazing, that it didn't give me everything I wanted in a book like this, that I didn't feel some instant connection to our heroine, Mercedes, and her weirdness. Her confidence. Her development. This, by foremost, is the best contemporary debut I have ever seen. Okay, that's a little exaggerated, but that's how my mood is. 
 I read this two months ago. Two months ago, I was the same person. So please do not think that my opinion has changed. It didn't. Firsts is just such a compelling, real story that is like a guide for feminism and for girls, that we have the power and capability to do whatever we want, that we shouldn't be used as objects or as different people. Equality, people. I haven't ever been such a strong feminist or have been interested in learning about women's rights, but after Flynn's impressive story, I feel like I need to read a book or two... or fifty about it. We have a real story. That's the thing that I loved about this book the most. You see, the synopsis makes this sound completely absurd and not right, but depending on your opinion of things or situations like this, you could be in love with this like I was. 
 Firsts contains a heroine, Mercedes, who is basically letting virgin boys test their ""skills"" (I am blushing typing that out because it sounds so weird) on or with her. It's messed up, yeah (it's cheating, yeah) but it gives her this confidence that she could help out, somehow. Her mother doesn't have a care in the world of what Mercedes does, and unlike her perfect-Catholic best friend, Angela, who is in a long-term relationship and is very happy, she still undergoes this confusion with the relationships that she wants to stay, specifically that with this HOT guy named Zach. At the same time, Mercedes is super-smart and is hoping to get into MIT. Basically, Laurie Elizabeth Flynn throws this interesting plot into a high school setting where we readers feel this crazy tension that her secret will be exploded into the hallways and she will be called everything that a girl will never want to be called. 
 I love how the synopsis (thanks, St. Martin's Griffin!) calls this book an one-of-a-kind read about growing up. These kinds of things affect every teenager everyday. Yeah, I would never in a million years do the things that Mercedes does (except for applying to MIT and making out with Zach!), but we see this stereotypical image of teenage girls all over the place, on social media and beyond. Why not take a stand? I mean, everyone has this different image of themselves. Many use their physical beauty as a way to boost their confidence, others intelligence, others physical abilities such as sports. For Mercedes, it was sex. And what a funny thing, her nickname is Mercy. 
 So girls, this is your anthem. You will be instantly addicted to this story, I know I was, and I can't stop thinking about it until this day. There are steamy scenes that make your heart turn inside out from time to time, and then we see a side of Mercy that begs for that cute romance that many teenage girls aspire to have. I find that authors these days like to speed things up for their characters, making impossible things happen to them during high school, where I am unable to relate to any of it all because I know that I will never do those things, but this book contains those different themes and such that I, myself, could relate to. Flynn touches upon everything: sex, school itself, drama, slut-shaming, friendship, actual love, forgiveness... perhaps everything that we could possibly think of. All of these themes affect us in one way or another, and I just love how they were blended in; I couldn't stop reading. 
 Now, I am going to dedicate this paragraph to Zach. AGH AGH AGH AGH AGH AGH AGH GBOGEIUBGEIGFJIIRYQUHRW OMGGG! I wish I could upload a video of myself fangirling here. No, I would never do that, haha. But.. I loved the relationship that he and Mercy had and my heart can't stop squirming and I cannot stop freaking out. I wish there was a novella from his perspective because it seemed that he liked Mercy from the start of the book and AHHHHHHHHH! *calms down* I apologize. Anyhow. 
 The only thing that I could pick at in this novel is the beginning portion where I wasn't so sure what would occur with Mercy's character, but that quickly subsided. Let's just blur that whole sentence out so we could pretend that there wasn't a thing wrong with this book. Speaking of wrong, MY FRIEND REALLY UPSET ME WHEN SHE THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS DUMB. If you think that this book sounds/is dumb, get out. *laughs and pats you on the back* 
 Firsts is easily a favourite for me, and I need to buy my own special copy and surround her with my golden books. I read this thanks to my library, but it's time for me to get my own personal guide. Girls of all ages (no, I'm kidding, of a certain age) GET THIS BOOK. Read it and love it and kiss it and hug it because I'm telling you, there is no other book like this in the entire universe. I am so ecstatic to read Laurie Elizabeth Flynn's next books in the near future!"
5,"Originally posted at my blog Michelle's Paranormal Vault of Bookse 
 WOW! This is an AMAZING story. I got so caught up in it, I kept hiding from my responsibilities to read more! I could not get enough of Caleb and Maggie. I think this series so far is a tie with some other favorites of mine. I am totally hooked. You have to give this book a chance, you will get hooked, and want to read the rest in the series too. This is the first one too. I sure with Ace's were real (its what Caleb is, and when he imprints with Maggie, she becomes one too, it's a good things) Ace's are human's sortof, with special abilities, and when they find their Significant (soul mate) they ascend and come into their full abilities. Each person has different abilities, and no way to know what you end up with. This story is mesmerizing in a way that is hard to describe. The way they feel for each other is epic, and makes you want to crawl into the book and be Maggie! Lol I can't praise enough on how much this story has moved me. It really, really gets to you. 
 It starts with Maggie saving Caleb's life, she pulls him back from stepping out in front of a fast moving truck, and saves him, they do not imprint until they touch (skin contact) and it don't happen right away, it's about 15 minutes later that it happens. Here is a very sweet quote, a look inside Caleb's head, he can show her his memories, and they can read each other's minds, and communicate silently too. Anyway, she was feeling like he only wanted to be with her because of the imprint, so he is showing her what he thought of her before they imprinted, when she saved him. It's very sweet. 
 Here is where he shows her, this is after he read her thoughts of her insecurities.

 ""That is absolutely not true."" He insisted, reading my feelings, before laying his forehead against mine. 
 I felt the push and tingle of our skin, his heartbeat steady beside mine, and then I was seeing him, a vision of him. He was standing at a stoplight, listening to Cage The Elephant on his mp3 player and thinking about Kyle coming to join him at Tennessee the next semester. He looked back and did a double take as a beautiful young girl made her way to the cross walk stop. 
 I couldn't believe that was what I looked like to him. I didn't look like some silly high school girl. I looked pretty and confidant, distant and a little sad. 
 The girl looked around and even in the dim light he could see her freckles. He liked them. She checked her phone and stopped behind him to wait. He wanted to turn and get a better look, but didn't want to seem like he was checking her out so he peeked back and smiled and nodded when she caught him instantly. He turned back and wished he could talk to her, but there was no point. It would make it worse. 
 He waited impatiently for the light to turn so he could leave and get the girl out of his mind. He had no idea why he was so struck by her anyway. The light turned and he peeked back once more and started to cross but she wasn't looking, she was checking her phone again. He didn't look both ways before crossing because he was looking back, to get one last peek before never seeing her again. Me. 
 When he turned back it was too late, then he felt a jerk on his back and tumbled backwards on top of something. When he rolled off and realized what had happened. The sad, anxious, beautiful girl had saved his life. 
 He didn't know what to say or do. He asked if she was ok and when he finally heard her voice saying that she was, he thought it was the sweetest sound ever to hit his ears. 
 He could see a cut on her brow and reached his hand to push back her hair. It was soft and curly. He could smell her shampoo and it was doing marvelous things to his senses. Add that to the sweet green eyes looking up at him and that was it. 
 He started to question right then if he was imprinting with her, but no visions came, no jolts or tingles or fire as was described by his family. Just butterfies and a racing pulse. 
 And he was disappointed. 
 He never found anyone he really wanted before. There was no one he ever thought about breaking the no dating rule with, no one that made his heartbeat and trip, until now. And he was so very disappointed that he couldn't have her, especially after she saves his life. 
 We stop there, move on to after he walks her to Kyles (his cousin, who she is friends with, she was supposed to meet up with) they talk and he really likes her. Then they do shake hands and the imprint happens, I won't quote that part. But it's cool how it happens. 
 Here is after the imprint and the visions ect 
 Kindle location 2773 
 He knew it. He had just imprinted with the girl he wanted more than any other, the girl he thought he'd never have. She was his. 
 I was brought back to the present when Caleb pulled his head back a little, but kept his face close. 
 ""Now, you see. Don't doubt how I feel about you. This has nothing to do with an imprint and everything to do with you"" 
 I was breathless and in awe of what Caleb had shown me, his memories. They were clear and vivid and had seemed all too real. It was strange to watch the same event through different eyes. What was stranger still was that Caleb had wanted me before the imprinting. Before. I couldn't stop the smile that spread my cheeks. 
 I knew I needed to say something. 
 ""You almost got hit by a truck because you were checking me out?"" I joked and he laughed loudly. 
 ""Yeah. It's a good thing you saved me. It would have been all your fault if I didn't make it,"" he said through a grin. 
 See why I love Caleb, he is the best guy EVER!! 
 This book has lots going on, a rival Ace family, is jealous because they had imprinted, as none of the Ace people have imprinted in a long time. So now they are out to get Maggie, to try to keep her and Caleb from ascending and coming into their full powers. It's got lots of action and suspense. 
 It's fascinating how this all plays out. Its written brilliantly too. 
 Give it a shot. (I have this set of books as a prize for a giveaway at my blog check it out link below ) 
 I highly recommend this book and series to anyone who loves a good paranormal romance."

 Today, I have finally finished The Infernal Devices. Oh, man. That ending. THAT ENDING! I did not expect that at all. I cried. Clockwork Princess was such a beautiful, extraordinary ending to an amazing trilogy."
4,"There is no secret how much I admire Penelope and consider her one of my favorite writers. Everything she has is for her readers and I apreciate the effort she puts in every one of her books. She is so talented and a has a secret fountain of inspiration, full of amazing stories and characters that will surely connect with her readers. 
 So, another book, another adventure. I know that the saying ""Don't judge the book by its cover"" has to apply all the time, but now, considering the cover that Mack Daddy has, I totally judged it as being amazing. And of course I was right :D 
 We follow the story of Mackenzie ""Mack"" and Francesca ""Frankie"" and we are delighted to see their development from friends to lovers. The story is brought to us both past and present and I really enjoyed getting a glimpse of their relationship in the early stage. Initially roommates, then friends, them friends who developed strong feelings for one another, but because of the circumstance they could not express openly what they wanted. The problem was that Mack has a girlfriend, and wanting to do things right, he didn't confess his feelings for Frankie until settling things first, to be able to love her freely. But of course faith has other things in stored for them, leading Mack to take a decision and leave Frankie brokenhearted. Now, after 8 years, Mack is back in Frankie's life determined to get her back. Only, he is a father now and Frankie is his boy's teacher. I know.. really twisted, but this ""coincidence"" is what brought them together again. 
 I loved the way the characters were created. Frankie was adorable and I enjoyed so much both sides of her, the past one in which she was vulnerable, insecure and kind of clumsy and the present one in which she was strong and determined. Although time passed, she was now a fine creation of both her personalities, but one thing didn't changed.. it was her love for Mack. She opened up so much to him, showed him her fears and weaknesses and I was so taken aback on how Mack understood her and made her realise how important she is and how she should consider her more. If I come to think of it, the present Frankie is here due to Mack, because of his support and words that marked her for the better and determined her to follow her dreams. 
 Mack on the other hand, was extremely funny and confident, but he also had some issues that went way back. His problems with his dad caused him a lot of problems and managed to control his life. He was also a man driven by his word, so when his girlfriend became pregnant with his child, he had no use but to leave Frankie behind and give his boy the family he needed. Now, after all this years he was back for her because he loved her and considered to had lost a lot of time that could be spend together. 
 Although back then, they didn't even kiss, this connection surpassed the physical needs and that is why I loved it so much. It was passion and lust yes, but not expressed. In this relationship, the feelings were deeper, the connection was intense and you could feel the tension between them. They clicked on every levels and you don't have to be a genius to figure that out. 
 When a hero fails in doing a certain thing, I expect him to fight and win his beloved back. Mack did it, made it his mission to get Frankie back, even if she had a boyfriend now. There was no cheating involved, and I really felt the struggles and somehow pure despair that Mack felt when he couldn't be around her anymore. They were so good together and Penelope brought us a story about getting to rekindle the connection and love they both once shared. Of course the scenes between them were exactly like I expected, like a volcano that just erupted and will keel on smoking for a long time. 
 As we all know Penelope, a part of this story will raise awareness about a certain problem a lot of people suffer from, and I admire her courage in talking about it and in a way giving pieces of advice to people that may see themselves in this situation. This mix of love, hope, second chances, betrayal and redemption was the perfect way of getting to read another amazing book from Penelope Ward. 
 I also enjoyed the drama she also inserted in the story, mostly at the ending chapters, but the thing that I didn't liked was the way the culprits were not punished enough. After all the lies and deception, I have wanted more people to pay for their actions and there is where I think the writer went soft on them. 
 But, putting all the pieces together, I totally recommend this funny and intense book that will either make you discover Penelope or love her more than you already do. 
 4 stars!

1,"Looks like another ""Eric Book"""
3,"Fast, energetic, science fiction/time travel story that jumps right into the plot, leaving some room for characterization. When four foster kids, all in desperate need of money, and one super smart science geek, also in need of money, are recruited by Aether Corporation for research they all jump at the chance, especially Elena. For all of her anger issues, she does have aspirations for college and in two months she turns eighteen, which means she'll be out on her own. With all those zeroes in their paycheck, the five of them pretty much just nod their heads yes when told they will be traveling ten years into the future with little to no training or other information. I had a big problem with that, but I think teen readers, especially those looking for something that will keep them interested, will look right over it. Their ""mission"" is simple, travel back in time, take some notes and report back within 24 hours. The usual time travel rhetoric is given: don't find yourselves, don't talk to anyone you know, and don't change anything. 
 Elena and the group do what they're told but immediately figure out they are not ten years into the future but thirty. The see driverless cars, computers hooked to your brain via a sticker on your face, fingerprint access to purchases, and a completely empty building that should have housed Aether Corporation in the future. As they look at the future, they want to know more about themselves, a big no-no. Unfortunately, only one of them can find their future self, leaving the other four to question if they are even alive anymore. When they find out what really happens to them the day they return from the future, the more they fight to change it. 
 Again, this was a quick entertaining read that will be perfect for students who don't need a lot of world building or characterization to enjoy the book. Did I mention this isn't a series??!!"
2,"2 stars for the premise and for the fact that the villain of the story was well written and just a little bit fascinating. 
 -1 star for the awkward writing, grammatical errors and unrealistic ""voice"" of a character who is 14 years old. 
 -2 stars for the sheer idiocy of every character that is not the villain or Lisa. 
 This book has a bunch of rave reviews but I personally wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Its a short read and inexpensive so why not check it out but it left me feeling disappointed and annoyed."
4,"I love Valerius, I don't care if he is stodgey, snooty, and burdened with a stick up his sphincter. Like Tabby, I find it rather endearing. 
 Val and Tabby are an unlikely pairing, but I loved them all the same. As well, this novel delves deeper into the backstories of both Nick and Acheron. Whom I also love."
4,"I liked this book a lot better than I expected to. I had read an excerpt from it a few months ago and I thought the writing was terrible, so I decided to never read it. However, 2 weeks ago I got bored and decided to see New Moon in theaters. Somehow, I got hooked. After watching the movie Twilight online, I went to the library to check out the book and I devoured its 500-pages in less than two days. I'll definitely be reading the rest of this series soon."
3,"It's not you, book. It is I. 
 I think it's finally established that the Magdalene series is too mature for me. Not in a sexual way but with the family problems and whatnot. 
 The series caters a certain age group that I have trouble relating with. (This book is for middle aged women, I guess.) I mean, Amelia was older than my mom. Add to that, we don't have divorce here in my country so even though I've read about what divorce is like in books, it's still foreign to me. The messy custody fights and dealing with ex-wives and ex-husbands in this book were a whirlwind for me. 
 Mickey and Amelia failed to capture my heart unlike most of KA's main characters. Perhaps it was the fact that they're the oldest main characters that I've encountered. Amelia certainly had depth but at the same time, I expected her to be more...lady-like like Josephine. She was supposed to be an heiress and yet she sounded like normal housewife when her life wasn't anywhere near normal at all, being rich and all that. Mickey was the generic KA hero: an archetypical alpha male. Nothing new, nothing really remarkable. 
 Also, the book's progress was slow. I was fine with it but I admit that I did skim in some parts. The climax fell short for me. In the last quarter of the book, I kept waiting for the climax to hit. I wouldn't even know I already reached the apex of the story had I not checked my location in the book. I was like, ""Wait, what, that was it?"" I was used to her heart-thudding climaxes, not something like this. I knew that an author's style would sometimes vary and maybe it was just me feeling new about it. But with the build-up like that, I thought that climax was insufficient. 
 There were also some KA-isms that didn't work for me with the pace this story had. You see, there were times whenever a new chapter started and a KA heroine was asked what was wrong or how she was, she suddenly did this week-worth or more flashback in her mind. It tended to get very long sometimes that when you were back to the original conversation and the the heroine answers, I sometimes forget what the heck they were initially talking about. This was fine for me in other books because they were fast-paced, not this. I got lost a lot because of it and I found it very inconvenient reading back and forth. 
 So in the near future, I'm gonna be really reluctant to pick up books in this series buuuut I'm so looking forward to the next book in Chaos!"
4,"3.5 stars!! 
 A stolen book. 
 A deadly plan. 
 A destiny discovered. 
 If high school is all about social status, Indigo Blackwood has it made. Sure, her quirky mom owns an occult shop, and a nerd just won't stop trying to be her friend, but Indie is a popular cheerleader with a football-star boyfriend and a social circle powerful enough to ruin everyone at school. Who wouldn't want to be her? 
 Then a guy dies right before her eye. And the dusty old family Bible her mom is freakishly possessive of is stolen. But it's when a frustratingly sexy stranger named Bishop enters Indie's world that she learns that her destiny involves a lot more than pom-poms and parties. If she doesn't get the Bible back, every witch on the planet will die. And that's seriously bad news for Indie, because according to Bishop, she's a witch too. 
 Suddenly forced into a centuries-old war between witches and sorceres, Indie is about to uncover the many dark truths about her life--and a future unlike any she ever imagined on top of the cheer pyramid. 
 So I had very mixed feelings about this book. Don't get me wrong, I love the overall premise and everything, but something about this book just rubbed me wrong. 
 Indie was a great main character. She was helpless in the beginning, but when things got bad, she didn't spend a lot of time moping and wondering what she was going to do. Given what happened, she spent some time wondering what she was going to do, but considering the situation, I think she was entitled. However, when she got really tired of constantly just getting by, she stepped up and learned to use what powers she had. 
 Bishop was interesting. His physical description made him sound sooo attractive! Not to mention his sense of humor and his jokes. Although some of his jokes were just BAD. I loved the tension between he and Indie though! It was hilarious and when it finally blew up, it was just...Wow! 
 I loved that Paige was such a great friend. Indie had been so horrible for so long, basically ignoring Paige from the time Bianca entered the picture. All things considered, Paige had no reason (or obligation) to stick with Indigo, yet she did. I love her character and I wish that she'd had a bigger part to play! I hope we get to see more of her in Charmed! 
 Jezebel was the requisite ex, but I liked her in a way. She knew how to handle Leo and Frederick and she helped Bishop and Indigo. Sort of. I did have trouble trusting her at first. Something about her entrance just struck me as strange. I have to wonder about her loyalty. Granted, in the end, she did help out, but it felt a little reluctant. Wonder if she'll be back? 
 Bianca and Devon I just hated. Bianca was so horrible and I honestly hated her from the beginning. Devon was ok-ish, right up until he ignored Indie at Jay-Z. My impression of him went downhill after that. Then when Indie found him at the party, I just wanted him to go away. (view spoiler)[I'm surprised she agreed to go with him to homecoming (lack of other dates not-withstanding) (hide spoiler)] 
 Aunt Penny certainly surprised me. I hope we get more about her in the next book. 
 Something witchy this way comes..."
1,"I tried, but it really didn't work for me. Jumping back and forth between a contemporary combat scene and extended flashbacks and flashbacks within flashbacks was too distracting."
4,Solid follow up to the first.
4,"Longest it's taken me to finish a book in a while. I read part of the ending in a drug-induced haze, that was interesting. 
 I'm glad certain things that had lingered a wee bit too longer finally got tied up. The book left me with a good feeling. (view spoiler)[Although I wanted to strangle Hero at times, and was fully supportive of Sebastian's suggestion of kidnapping her. I hope that Hero marries Sebastian, and not some stupid ton fop. (hide spoiler)]"
1,"I made it 155 pages, which was pretty generous; past my 100 page rule. So, the problem? An interesting mystery (a magical book!) was presented on page 10, and since then (145 pages later!!) nothing has happened. The book has remained on its shelf at the library, while our protagonist has been romanced by a scary, overprotective vampire (who watches her sleep - where have I read this before?). And yoga. Really - vampire/witch yoga - yuck. And there are demons too, but it's spelled daemon, and apparently these are just bi-polar artistic people. (So if your kid's too moody, maybe they are a daemon). Not much explanation - but lots of page space devoted to our main character making tea. 
 Enough. As my daughter pointed out, it's a trilogy, so I should run away quickly rather than spend more time hoping it gets better."
4,"Really a 4.3/5 stars 
 This book was a really quick read for me, I started it at nine o'clock last night and finished it just about now! Everything, Everything was so unique and I really enjoyed that aspect of the novel. However, I do think the ending was a bit rushed and I was a little frustrated with the actual ending. 
 Overall though, a very cute and interesting read!"
4,Personal rating: 4.25
4,"One of Shakespeare's more simplistic plays, Twelfth Night has both comedy and drama and above all else, creativity. The writing style makes it even more of an intriguing read."
5,"I haven't gone through every path yet, but I've gone through quite a few. Mostly as Juliet (except when, as Juliet, I pretended to be Romeo trying to seduce Juliet, that is me, but then somehow became Romeo, now me, trying to seduce Juliet, now no longer me.) so I feel safe reviewing this a bit. 
 This is basically the best kind of fun to have with your friends--especially book lovers, English majors or Shakespeare lovers. North has an irreverent tone that, while it doesn't always work completely well with the actual jargon/lines from Shakespeare, does make it fun to read and run through multiple times in one sitting. 
 As a Choose Your Own Adventure book sometimes the paths seem utterly contrived...but North admits this will happen bc come on he can't account for EVERY variable as genuine experience. 
 --- 
 Your name is Juliet (or Romeo). You live in Old-Timey Verona, where we've set our scene, and are either too milquetoast to tell your parents no or in love with the idea of being in love, thus setting into motion a tale of star-crossed lovers. Or not. I mean Juliet, if you just say 'yes' to your mother you can go and marry boring old Paul Rudd...I mean Paris and Romeo you have a chance to go and get that Rosalind girl you spend most of your opening pining after for some reason. 
 Or Juliet you can run off and be a pirate! Romeo you can...I have no idea what you can do otherwise, I refused to follow his path because omg he is so annoying. Juliet gets choices like ""run far far away from everything for adventures"" while Romeo gets ""do you go chat up the girl?"". 
 Of course you could be that person who follows the story as Shakespeare wrote it (North helpfully has little hearts next to the choices that will lead you down that tragic angsty path). Personally I vote you say ""no"" as soon as you to your Mother, run away, chat up some guy at a bar, and somehow make your fortune on the high seas instead. (can you tell I love the pirate ending for Juliet?). 
 North plays fast and loose with the time period, the play, the characters, the character motivations, Shakespeare's intentions and pretty much everything else you can think of for him to play fast and loose with. Even if you follow the ""canon"" path for R&J, North is at pains to be like ""are you really sure that's a great idea? Here's a better one!"" to tempt you towards a more satisfying ending. Its actually more of a chore to ignore his glib asides, irreverent commentary and anachronistic observations to complete the ""canon"" version then it is to go with the flow towards a different ending. 
 Each segment is short enough that if you want to play this as a party game (which I heartily recommend) you can, passing the book around to each person as choices are made. Each ending's illustration is alternately absurd (a muscle-bound, fiercely grinning Juliet swinging a sword while in a dress!) or sweet (Juliet and a beau living in martial bliss far away from the idiots in Verona), breaking up the text. I did flounder at first with the page set-up however; this isn't traditionally numbered. As some snippets are barely a line or more then a page, you have to be careful when moving from choice to choice to make sure you are at the BEGINNING of that choice (sometimes on the previous page). 
 Overall this was a fun, inventive way to spend my time. Like the OMG Shakespeare books I think they may also be a good way to get reluctant readers into the classics. Look, even though I love Twelfth Night and Midsummer's Night Dream and Macbeth - they are NOT easy to get through. Especially if you go for the really old text and not the slightly updated so at least they don't have weird punctuation and apostrophes everywhere text. For reluctant readers, or readers who struggle with reading due to attention span or not reading English fluently (for whatever reason), books like this can help bridge that gap. 
 North does a fine job of presenting the actual text (especially if you follow the canon path), while making it accessible to everyone and giving context. Paired with a unit on Shakespeare in Modern Times or some such thing, I think this could be a fine teaching tool. 
 Or do like me, break out the vodka (or rum) and have a ridiculously fun time with your friends. Either way, this is a winner of a book."
4,"When Lexi turned sixteen, she felt the sudden urge to go for a late night swim. Her soon-to-be boyfriend Steven, whom she had longed to be with for soooo long, got dragged along. Once she burst into song, Lexi's sudden urge felt fulfilled, and to her horror, she found Steven's body floating lifelessly in the ocean. Shunned by her friends, Lexi spent the next two years being tortured by her ex-best friend (Steven's sister) because no one bought that such an excellent swimmer just happened to cramp and drown with Lexi by his side. Except Cole, Steven's best friend, who incidentally had been attracted to her for years regardless of the accusations. 
 Lexi's finally on the verge of being happy again when Erik shows up and tells her he's a Nix, her male complement. He's on the verge of becoming a Nix at eighteen and claims that if a Nix and a Siren can fall in love and accept one another for what they are, both their curses can be broken. And though she tries desperately to fall in love with Erik, her heart seems to remain with Cole... 
 Ripple was completely predictable, so don't start this book thinking you're gonna get a whopper of a twist thrown at you. However, I still found the story really enjoyable. The prose was simple and sweet, Lexi had decent character growth and her romance with Cole developed at a believable pace. All in all, Ripple was a good book and worth picking up.

2,"I wanted to like this because I so LOVED ""Code Name Verity"", but I thought it was quite slow and boring. I feel bad even typing that! This might be a case where listening to the book made me like it less because I thought the male narrator used really odd accents for many of the characters."
4,Not one of Pratchett's best but still an great book. I really enjoyed it.
4,"Ugh, honestly these books are like crack. I really want to stop because I hate every single character but dammit I can't because I'm starting to love their asses. This one was no different. I fucking HATE Alec. This arrogant, egotistical former male escort who thinks he's God's gift to women. But then we started learning more about him and you can't help but start to love him. I started falling under his spell. Keela now, well she started off annoying as fuck. I couldn't stand her. Why does the author write her women so damn overbearing and bitchy? But later on when she finally stop being a fucking doormat, she became likable. I was all for this book until Alec up and cheated on her. I said fuck this noise after that. This should have just ended with them parting ways. So what he had no choice. Alec could have still said no, confront Keela, she would have confronted her Uncle and all this would have been avoided and worked out like what happened in the end. Plus all these brothers are a bunch of fucking lairs. I applauded Keela when she stood up to all of them and told them off. Then Alec had the fucking NERVE to make himself be the victim when they were kidnapped? HEAUX YOU CHEATED ON KEELA !!!!!! SHE HAD A RIGHT TO CUSS YOUR SKANKY ASS OUT. Also this was another misleading story. At the end of Bronagh, we all assumed Marco was dead, then in this , all of a sudden the fucker is back kidnapping people? Are we sure Alec killed him this time? I want PROOF dammit. Pictures or it never happened. Well in the end I still love the lying sac of shits these brothers are. I love their family dynamic and the girls are really making them better. They are also very funny. You can't help but laugh along when you read this. The sex is also freaking hot. Dammit Alec, DAMMIT. ""I will fuck you like I hate you"" Damn right he did!!! :D"
3,"I'll always love you and make you happy, 
 If you will only say the same. 
 But if you leave me to love another, 
 You'll regret it all some day."
1,"When I first saw this book I thought, wow. Such a pretty cover. After reading all the raving and positive reviews I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. I was so frikken ecstatic. 
 And when I finally got the book...the disappointment. I started reading this book three months ago. I haven't finished it and I never will. I have given up. 
 It was boring but that's not the issue here. I've been able to read boring books from beginning to end. The issue here was that this book was boring and irritating. Trust me there is nothing worse than a boring irritating book. 
 The protagonist Sam, seemed more like she was her own damn antagonist because she was the one that was screwing up her own life. She was shallow, mean, immature and STUPID. I honestly couldn't cope with her level of stupidity. She just made me angry and I hated her more and more with every page that I turned. 
 Honestly, I was pissed 90% of the time reading this. The other 10% I was bored. 
 After a few times of Sam getting her whole do over in life I just wanted it to end. I honestly wouldn't mind if she died - and stayed dead. Yup. There. I said it. But I guess I'll never know if she died or not because I won't be continuing this book. 
 But everyone else seemed to like this book though so I guess it's just not my taste. I have nothing against the author though. I just don't like this book."
2,"If this book had been cut by about two-thirds I still wouldn't have loved it, but at least it would have been a little more interesting. The majority of the story just dragged, and while the last bit had some action, the whole thing was plagued by the saccharine (and often silly) over-drama that is teen romance. Also, this may have been exacerbated by the fact that I was listening to an audiobook, but the main character (and the other souls) came off as really robotic and therefore hard to sympathize with. They felt more like AIs than aliens. The best I can say is that I liked it more than Twilight."

 Favorite Quote: ""I'm not saying you don't have the God-given right to be neurotic, but must you exploit that privilege?"" 
 Riley Porter, a raven shifter, has found a home for herself and more importantly for her kids with the Phoenix Wolf Pack. Though she knows not everyone is thrilled with her being there, she never expected to wake up in bed after an impromptu party and copious amounts of tequila with her most vocal dissenter...the very sexy Tao Lukas. 
 Tao doesn't like change and nor many people. As the head enforcer for the Phoenix Pack, his job is to sniff out danger before it happens and his nose is saying Riley isn't being completely honest about why she left her pack. But the sexual tension that has been building between them has become impossible to ignore and after Tao gets a taste of Riley, he admits his feelings for her are deeper than just a one time fling. 
 Riley agrees to give their attraction a chance and see where it leads, even inviting Tao to come with her to her uncles' anniversary party. When Riley's uncle is shot, her secrets begin to come to light, putting her and the pack in danger. As Tao works to discover who wants to harm Riley and the pack, he realizes that he will do whatever it takes to keep his family and his mate safe. 
 Though this is the 6th book in a well-established series, the storyline is inclusive enough to stand on its own. Enemies to lovers relationships are always fun to watch unfold and this couple certain provides plenty of entertainment-vocally and sexually. I'm glad Wright decided to go with Riley's story next. I've been waiting to know more about her since first meeting her during Savage Urges. Riley is a raven shifter who left her flock for reasons and ends up in the Phoenix Pack by way of Makenna Wray. Strong, intelligent, loyal, and delightfully snarky, Riley fits in perfectly with this pack with her playful ways and deadly skills. Her two kids-Dexter and Savannah-are quite funny with their little quirks and habits. 
 Though I wasn't too keen on Tao at first, he's been rather quiet in the background, I soon realized he was a perfect match for Riley. A grumpy dominant through and through, he has a way of cutting through the artifice and telling you exactly how it feels. A bit rude and crude at times, he does what he wants when he wants with one hundred percent focus and precision. Riley infuriates him, annoys him, confounds him, and tempts him like no other. He gives her plenty of room to grow but refuses to allow her to shut him out like she does the others. 
 I love that Wright's PNRs are so modern, sexy, and fun. There aren't any of the strict and obviously misogynistic rules in here regarding females, different species fraternization, or mating that you find in some of the other shifter stories. The males and females are equals in every way and while the males may devolve into some alpha melodramatic moments when they find the one they want to be with, there are lines they know they can't cross and still live to talk about it. The females in here aren't pushovers and don't put up with anyone's crap. 
 ""Hit me,"" Tao repeated, sensing just how on edge she was. ""You're gonna snap if you don't get it all out of you. Don't worry; I can take a punch from an itty-bitty thing like-motherfucker!"" 
 Two intriguing storylines intertwine with the romance, using Riley's past and an external source to expand the character base and strengthen what is already in play arc wise. I was a little shocked at how easily Riley and Tao fall into a relationship after we are told of Tao's antagonism towards Riley. Riley has some misgivings when they wake up in bed together but Tao basically just tells her to deal and she does. The fiery chemistry between them does help to create a more believable venture. Their attraction for one another is seen and felt in every scene they appear in; encouraged by some seriously steamy and bold love scenes. I love a couple who has fun in and out of bed and this couple definitely does. 
 ""I'm thinking about f*cking your mouth, to be exact."" 
 ""Of course you are,"" she said drily. ""You're a boy. Boys are delusional."" 
 He smiled. ""You're not going to let me feel what it's like to slide my cock in your mouth? That doesn't seem fair. I go down on you all the time."" 
 ""Oh, I won't deny you eat p*ssy like a champ."" 
 He laughed. ""Like a champ?"" 
 ""Totally. But you know, over seventy percent of erectile dysfunction cases are caused by having too many blow jobs."" 
 ""They are not."" 
 ""They could be."" 
 I did have some issues. The two plotlines were weak and not as developed as some seen in previous installments. There were just too many questions left unanswered and it was hard to get involved with either one as most of the investigations were done off screen. I wish we had been given a bit more information and about the Raven shifters. Wright stayed rather vague about them as a whole. There were also some sexual aspects that were not sexy. Scooping out cream is not a sexy phrase or act. If you can scoop anything out of your vagina, you need medical treatment. Also, anal sex without lube is not sexy. Telling someone they'll enjoy it and not to worry, is not sexy or consent. I need to hear/read the words. Lastly, I'm tired of Greta. Her time spent as the series antagonist has gone from mildly amusing to irritating. I'm not a fan of letting elders verbally abuse the people around them. 
 The ending comes at us hard and fast as the pack is attacked on multiple fronts and Tao and Riley have to fight to the death to protect the pack and each other. All in all, Wright continues to entertain with this series and despite my issues, I'll still recommend these as enjoyable fast reads with sexy and snarky heroes and heroines who kick ass and always willing to cross the line for those they love. 
 RATING: C"
4,"A Shade of Vampire was a quick and easy read. Straight to the point from the very beginning left me with a kind of bittersweet feeling over the whole book. 
 It was a great story - original, and full of a decent amount of action and romance. 
 Sofia is kidnapped on her 17th birthday to a secret island where vampires freely roam, using humans as slaves. On this island, Sofia meets Derek, a vampire prince, who has been sleeping for 400 years. 
 While I enjoyed the romance and instant connection between both characters, it seemed a bit unreal (even for a vampire novel... hahaha) that he was hooked on first sight. The fast-paced set of action throughout the novel and unnaturalness of it all is probably what made me give this book a 4 star rating instead of the 5. 
 I did, however, thoroughly enjoy the story. :) 
 I see a lot of mixed reviews on here from people who are in love to those who straight-up disliked it. Odd. 
 It's a good read and fast, too. 
 Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did (or more)."
5,"Toby was glad to escape from Blanco, her abusive homicidal boss at SecretBurgers (the secret was what kind or kinds of meat they used in them) so she welcomed the vegetarian cultists from God's Gardeners when they took her away with them. Dressed in their look-alike dark blue clothes she blended right in safe from Blanco and the pleebrat gangs. She found their beliefs a bit eccentric. It was a mixture of Christianity and Extreme Environmentalism, Dian Fossey and Euell Gibbons were among their saints along with Francis of Assisi. They were awaiting the imminent Waterless Flood, the environmental disaster that would end all human civilization. But when it came even the Gardeners were unprepared for what it did to humanity."
3,"Um, I feel like I need to re-read These Broken Stars and then re-read this in order to figure out exactly what is going on with these books. 
 And possibly read a physical copy, and not the ebook, to see if my brain clicks better. 
 It was muddy. That's really the only thing I can think to say, of the story and the characters and my experience reading this. Just so very muddy. 
 It did clear up in the end, but because of the poor set-up it was a little too late to rectify my enjoyment. 
 Actual review to come, at some point. 
 Also I think this might be the last book of 2014. Too bad it had to be a disappointing one."
3,"I am torn about how I feel about Raven Cursed. On one hand, I feel like the book has a really solid and intriguing UF plot. However, on the other I feel like this is one of the books where there was just a little too much piled on all at once. 
 The primary plot has Jane acting as head of a security team for a vampire parley near Asheville, NC as her last job within her contract to Leo Pellissier. This story line ties closely to an open plot line from previous books featuring conflict between Jane and Evangeline, her bestie's sister. These two plots provide plenty of action, intrigue, and conflict to keep the story interesting, so I am not sure it makes sense to have the other several minor plots (of varying degrees of interest) interwoven into the story. Still the action is solid and the world building remains interesting. 
 There is one thing that keep me from giving this book any higher rating than three stars. There are some pretty major plot lines opened but not resolved within the framework of the book. I don't mind carrying minor threads from book to book, but I am not a fan of cliff hangers. Better authors find ways of at least tidying up the loose ends, but this does not happen here. Regardless, I think most fans of urban fantasy will enjoy the book, even if it is not among their favorites."
3,very cute story but the parents were so frustrating I wanted to throw the book.
3,"Another secret of the universe: Sometimes pain was like a storm that came out of nowhere. The clearest summer could end in a downpour. Could end in lightning and thunder. 
 I think this book is a beautiful, well-written piece of work. The storyline is slow-paced but moving, every parts are significant. I love the cover, I love the characters, the red truck, the star-gazing moment at the desert. OMG. I really want to go star gazing sometimes, in a wide spread place, barren, no sound pollution. 
 It touched an important issue here, the lgbt during 1987, where boy caught up kissing another boy was beat up. It's also about growing up, changing of phase from boyhood to adult, all the teen's angst, the anger, the learning of oneself, the secrets of the universe, finding one's identity. I never knew a boy can have so much anger in himself. 
 The characters are lovely, I like Ari and Dante. Though Ari can be a jerk sometimes, but I love him because he's a good, decent boy, he's honest, not trying to be someone he's not. Dante kinda reminds me of Augustus Waters, with all his talking. 
 Overall, it's a good read. A light reading that I need during this exam period."
4,"This is a novel, well researched and well written. Having just finished [A Moveable Feast], I felt like it was hard to remember I was reading a novel. I loved Hadley's story, her devotion and her constant support. I was fascinated by the expat social scene and the wild lives they all lived. It was also very interesting to see how Hemingway used many of his experiences and people he knew in his books. I have to say that I liked [A Moveable Feast] better, maybe because it ended before the marriage fell apart. That was painful to read and actually upset me. I am not sure why. I guess I really identified with Hadley on some level. I think she was a lovely person and Hemingway was a fool to leave her. On the other hand, she was likely better off."
2,"Meh. MarySue heroine, unclear writing (are groundmites bugs? why do they have shields? if they aren't bugs... what are they?), and WAY too many plot digressions. There was just no sense of urgency in the writing. Times when the tension SHOULD be high, suddenly the heroine is having tea or sweeping a cabin or something. 
 There was a lot about this book that I wanted to like, but I ended up having to force myself to finish it. Disappointing."
5,"A really fascinating and engaging novella! 
 This world is the same as our, except demons and people with abilities (paranormally abled, or mals) exist. As such events are familiar, but altered' for example, 9/11 was a release of demons causing deaths rather than a plane crash by terrorists. In this world demons can be summoned but it is illegal, and taught in schools such like don't do drugs- 'don't make deals with demons'. However, much like drugs people still summon demons, make deals, try to control them to their benefit. This has caused the creations of Spectr, a government agency which deals with all things demonic. This is of course the core of the story. 
 In this world, even though mals are born with their abilities naturally and can have almost no power, they are despised and distrusted, registered and placed for the world to see on the internet. As such Caleb has spent his entire life hiding his small ability from the world, protected by his family. But, when he loses his brother to a demon he joins with a group that hates mals to attempt to kill the demon and let his brother's body rest. Instead he ends up possessed by that self same demon and finds that the demon is uniquely strong and has taken up residence in his head and his body. 
 Sent from Spectr to deal with this possession is John Starkweather, a powerful exorcist who is confident in his ability to help Caleb. Much to his surprise he is unable to exorcise the demon- but also the demon is subdued by Caleb and not trying to harm humans. Left in this unusual situation where a possessed person is not a threat to other humans and in fact even shows that it can be a help against other demons, John begins to work with Caleb and finds that he has an attraction to the other man. 
 This story runs fast and hot. Really, it is more like the episodic online series books of these days, with the novella having a complete story but an immediate lead into the next story. It is well written and extremely interesting. I enjoyed this story and am planning to read the whole first volume of Spectr!"
4,This was sadder than I expected it to be but satisfying.
4,Quite entertaining and the chars really came alive. Definitely hooked.
5,"I saw this book in Borders (When it still existed) the summer that it came out and was immediately taken with it. The art- the summary, just the whole thing. 
 I Knew that it was full of intense gore and things of the such,so it didn't come as a surprise. 
 This book hooked me from the start. The dark twists and tales. The whole time it keeps you guessing. Who's right? Who's the bad guy? 
 No one is. 
 I don't want to spoil anything. But the twist was just. Wow. 
 It's actually really hard for me to write this review because I feel biased. I just like it SO much. 
 I keep forcing people to read it. I literally force it into their hands and demand they read it. 
 I even e-mailed the Author when I finished it to tell him how much I liked it. (I'm not a stalker- I swear) And you know what? HE ACTUALLY E-MAILED ME BACK. 
 The only bad thing I could say about this is the intense gore and dark themes. It's like a slasher movie lol but with an amazing story. There are just some parts that are NOT for the faint of heart."

5,Another amazing installment in the Night Prince series! Review to come :)

 Because, ... Cake, etc. THE COINCIDENCE OF COCONUT CAKE 
 http://fangswandsandfairydust.com/201... 
 Audio Book provided by Tantor Audio for review purposes. No remuneration was exchanged and all opinion presented herein is my own unless otherwise noted. 
 They ""had me"" at Coconut Cake. 
 There's a story there having to do with the last piece of cake I didn't have on my birthday just before my celiac diagnosis. It was a coconut frosted cake with a fruit filling at a bakery in a small town we were tooling about in on my birthday and I did not want to buy the whole cake so I did not get any. A week later I got my numbers and it was a while before I had anything at all similar. 
 So, what a coincidence, eh? 
 Coconut cake and a birthday is the recipe around which this tale revolves. For the woman making the cake, it is an act of tradition and love, as is all cooking. For her fiance it is a valuable thing in that he is looking for the woman at home, in the kitchen, barefoot and taking care of a family. Yes, this stems from his childhood, but there's no denying that this fellow is an asshat who feels Lou's profession is not highbrow enough. 
 When this character makes a person this coconut cake she is giving that person her heart, her tradition, letting them into her past and those influences in her life she treasures. 
 She attracts a collection of loyal friends, and has to learn to forgive -- after all, we do hear that love ""forgives all things,"" right? Well, of course we hear that but I think it would be pretty hard to continue in a relationship where you learn someone ruined your livelihood it would be an act of truly deep love to overcome that. 
 This is the second foody book centered on Wisconsin. I am going to have to go there someday. It is actually quite an homage to the area, its people, festivals and food. 
 On the side of things I didn't especially like, there is an elderly couple who had been in the US since before WWII. The constant use of the word ""liebchen"" was a bit overdone. It's nice that the author gave us a couple with the influence of one of the ethnic groups important regionally, but the endearments and the accent in the audio bugged me - I get it -- they were born in Germany and represent the old-world influence on Wisconsin, the neighborliness, the friends as family and all those good feels. 
 This is a pretty clean book. It takes a long time to get to the bedroom and then it mostly happens off the page. There's no swearing either. I am a fan of more erotic books, but a sweet romance is nice once in a while. There's no overt religiosity. 
 Other than the Teutonic accent I liked the audio's narrator. The acting was not overdone, the voice was nicely balanced. 
 Good choice for something you could enjoy and then pass on to a friend without blushing."
5,"ARC kindly provided for an honest review - here ya go! 
 I don't know where to start, but I'll be honest and say I couldn't put this book down! 
 It starts out hot and ends hotter, is that possible? The HOTTNESS of this book is several THOUSAND Scoville heat units. Let's face it the main characters are having sex, in the first few pages of the book. HELLO! That's what mama likes right there, not dicking @ or beating @ the bush! Let's get it on!!! 
 Mary is moving on, she is over her past. The present is here. When she punches out Jimmy Falconi, she doesn't know he is her new client or a famous quarterback who is on the verge of losing his job, due to bad performance on the field. The sparks are instant between them, you can feel the connection between them. Life gets in the way. Both have a past that can crush them in an instant. Nothing can keep Jimmy from being with Mary, not even when she runs away. She comes back HOME, because she knows and he knows too. 
 Can Mary help Jimmy get his shit together on the field? And can Jimmy help Mary understand that he can make it all better for her? 
 This is a great story. You can feel the love and passion between Jimmy and Mary. He really tries to win her over, pulling her over to his side. It doesn't take much, because he's charming and is honest with Mary. He doesn't hide anything from her. And he needs that from her. He needs her to be honest with him. 
 I will admit I wanted more information on Mary's ex fiancee. I thought he'd be in the story more, messing with her head, planting the seed of doubt. But she surprised me and was strong enough to keep that door shut. Both characters are well written and you could just feel the pull between them. It was great. Even Bridget and Frankie Knuckles are great supporting characters. 
 This book does end with a HEA. Awe, so sweet."

 Second reading, post-movie, 2013: 
 Wowwwwwwwwww. I cannot believe how much they changed or left out in the movie. I mean really - it's like they met up and had a slash-and-burn session that got rid of 90% of the book, added a bunch of stuff in, and made a movie out of that. The most amazing part for me is that I don't disagree with any of their choices. 
 Things they changed (some of them, anyway): 
 - Combining Amma and Marian Ashcroft. I totally agree with this. It gave Amma's character much more depth and kept her from just being a stereotypical voodoo granny. Plus they made her LOOK like Marian Ashcroft, which gave her a really awesome wardrobe. 
 - Getting rid of most of the supernatural elements in Ethan and Lena's relationship. The dreams were there, but Ethan wasn't waking up with dirt in his bed, etc.; no telepathy at all; no crazy Sixteen Moons song showing up so only Ethan hears it. I didn't miss any of that in the movie, really. 
 - Ethan's parents. Mom's ghost in the study, and Dad's SUPER-CREEPY scribble-writing. Again, easily editable, but kinda interesting in the book. 
 - The plot. Honestly, the movie version is much less complicated, especially at the end. In the book Lena never makes Ethan forget her, so they can't just sideline him during the final battle. Also there are a lot more bad guys in the book, and they seem to just have been scared off, whereas what happened to Sarafine in the movie seemed more final (although it totally may not be). I'm still under the impression that Lena will have to pick a side in the future, in the book; in the movie, it seemed like picking BOTH sides was the answer to her problem. Seriously, the whole end was different - Lena actually DID have a choice, albeit with nasty consequences. It was all just structured really differently. 
 Like I said, I didn't actually disagree with any of the things they changed or cut. I think the dialogue in the movie was better - Ethan was about 500 times more charming in the movie - and the whole thing flowed a lot easier and made more sense. And I gotta say.... I first read the book three years ago and it did not stick with me at all. I barely remembered anything about the book before seeing the movie. Now I'm on to the sequels! 
 ________________________________________________________________ 
 First reading, April 6-10, 2010: 
 For the first third or so of this book, I didn't really get it. I mean, I understood what was going on, I just wasn't hooked. ""Here we go again with the angsty emo poetry-writing teenagers with a hidden paranormal twist..."" Then about halfway through, I started to realize it was getting harder to put down. I think the plot and action picked up and from that point on, it was way more interesting. 
 Ethan and Lena aren't my favorite characters I've ever read, but they're not my least favorite either, and the story was interesting enough that I'll probably read the sequel. 
 A couple of things that struck me: 
 - I could kind of FEEL that the main characters were written by people older than teenagers. All the things they liked were interests I would expect from a 30-year-old. I mean, why would a 15-year-old have an Atari t-shirt? It's way before their time. I suppose I prefer this to constant of-the-moment references to popular culture (the House of Night series is a good example of this) but it was a little disconcerting. 
 - This is NOT a positive view of small-town Southern life, by any means. I wonder how realistic it is, and how Southern readers reacted to it? 
 It seems sort of silly to me that Lena managed to not Claim either side, but still lost her Uncle Macon. He's the only one she was actually concerned about losing by Claiming Light anyway, so looking back on it she could have just Claimed Light and been done with it all - all the antagonists would have died and Macon had clearly stated that he expected and encouraged her to do it. Of course, she couldn't KNOW she would lose him anyway. 
 Oh well. On to the sequel."
0,"The only reason I actually want to read this is because whenever I start a series I can't live without finishing it,no matter HOW crappy that series might be."
5,"(view spoiler)[ The end of this volume is an unfinished sentence and six pages of complete black. (hide spoiler)] 
 And that about sums it up. 
 I was absolutely not expecting that. Every time I read a volume of Saga it cuts a little deeper. They're always hard, and they're always important, but for some reason the conclusion of volume seven... really hurt. Perhaps in a poetic gesture, I shed a single tear. 
 This was a rough one, folks."
3,"This was quite well plotted and kept me turning the pages. This is the way to write a prequel - look at the situation you've created and wonder, ""Wow, I wonder how all of this came to be."" Overall quite satisfying."
3,"*I had the great fortune of receiving a free copy from the author in exchange for an honest review. So glad he approached me* 
 Finally! This book was long but I won't complain. It was welcome change from the usual high paced romances. 
 Lilly looks like a very annoying, whiny, over-active and impractical child in the beginning. I kept wanting to shake her up and stuff some actual brains into her head. But as the story progressed, she grew on me. But I still wouldn't say she'd be standing for my favourite heroine of the month contest. 
 On the other hand Rikkard Ambrose is different from the usual characters. The author's deliberate move to make that elusive, mysterious hero worked quite well for me. His disdain for Lilly's general existence was quite funny! I kept shaking my head and chuckling at their interactions after a point. 
 What I really loved about the book was how well researched it seemed. It was sort of a perfect book for that lazy reader who wishes to read a historical romance but not do the hard work of looking up each new and unknown thing up on the internet. Robert Thier provides a handy reference to many phrases and words. 
 I didn't like one thing though. The story dragged at places.I suppose when it was serialised on Wattpad, the length might not have been an issue, but as a complete book, I would have preferred had it been shorter and more pithy."
4,"4 stars / 3 flames. 
 Joanna Shupe is a talented new historical romance author, and I have really enjoyed this series of steamy romances set in the Georgian era of British history. This book follows Lady Sophia and Viscount Quint, who we met in The Courtesan Duchess and The Harlot Countess. 
 Lady Sophia, at age 27, considers herself an unmarriageable spinster after she was duped by a rake during her first debut. Feeling oppressed by the limitations on women in society, Sophie decides to dress as a man in order to investigate matters for women whom society snubs. Her investigations take her through brothels, gaming hells, the docks, and other unsavory parts of the ton. Because Sophie is a good sleuth, she comes to the notice of some very dangerous people while she is investigating a serial killer of the Jack the Ripper variety. Sophia was a likable heroine, not of the dishwater miss variety that are somewhat common in historicals. Sophie flaunts convention to do what she believes is right, which is an admirable trait, but that leads her into danger more often than not. When she gets in over her head, she decides to approach Quint, whom she has admired for many years. 
 Damien, Viscount Quint, after suffering a gunshot injury in The Harlot Countess, becomes an agoraphobic prone to panic attacks and bouts of terror. Despite the tender feelings he has always held for Sophie, he does not need her meddling in his life while he is hiding such a huge secret. Luckily Sophia won't take no for an answer and forces her way into Quint's life. I really liked Quint, who is somewhat of a nerdy beefcake. Instead of cursing, Quint exclaims chemical elements when excited/angry - Sweet cadmium! His nerdish tendencies were endearing and unique for the genre. 
 This story and romance was paced well, there was no insta-love (yay!) but a sweetly unfolding relationship as Quint helped Sophie and vice versa. Speaking of the relationship, there was some very steamy sexytime in this book. But, if you have read the rest of the series, you know that Ms. Shupe is not afraid to steam up the pages. Characters from earlier books take a back seat in this installment, as the focus is on finding a serial killer and forcing Quint over his fear of going insane. If you are looking for a heated historical, this series is a must read. 
 I received and advanced copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."
3,"This book was at the same time better and worse than the first one. 
 The baddies 
 1)The sex. Yes this is erotica so it wasn't the sex as a whole that I found disturbing, it was the sex-on-the-dirt-without-nearby-shower that I had a problem with, especially since they were running for their lives through a forest the whole day. I mean sweat, germs, they don't even have water to drink let alone clean up. I mean Eww... 
 2)The first half of the book was kind of boring. Thank god the book wasn't bigger because I believe I would have dropped it before the fun stuff. 
 3)I failed to see the relationship development. I know that for the New Species guys love is at first sight(or at least obsession is) but I would like to see a more satisfying love story! 
 The goodies 
 1)The second half of the book more than made up for the first! It was exciting and it had twists you wouldn't expect and ACTION! 
 2)Moon, Harley, Brass! The New Species guys Trisha befriended were just AWESOME! I loved all three of them(maybe Moon a little more than the others). 
 3)Valiant! I already look forward to reading his book! Hope it isn't a dissapointment.*fingers crossed* 
 If I based my rating in the first half of the book it would be a 2 if I felt really generous but since the book had the second half too I will give it 3 stars.;)"
5,"Holy Crap.....I couldn't put this series down! I finished all 3 books in 3 days! 
 This series is so sexy and hot that you'll need a cold shower after reading it! Not only is there a shit load of awesome sexy times but there's also an awesome story line and characters that you can't help but fall in love with!"
4,"I had a hard time rating this book. On the one hand I enjoyed the book and I thought it was written really well. On the other hand, I didn't REALLY enjoy it. I didn't really love it. So I didn't know to do 3.5 stars or 4 stars. So I might say 3.75 stars? 
 Anyway, I really loved the language of this book. The prose was absolutely beautiful. 
 I read a lot of negative reviews of this book complaining about the plot. This is not a plot driven book. This is first and foremost a character driven novel. I think all the characters in this book are really interesting, but Tana especially. I didn't particularly LIKE her character, but I thought she was very interesting and she goes through so much character development it's really amazing. 
 So the characters are interesting enough to keep you reading; the setting is really good too. I think it is a realistic idea of how vampirism could spread as a virus and how humans would react. There are elements of rhetoric here- very very subtly added- on human nature. 
 -Is humanity obsessed with death? What is behind our obsession with vampires and the occult? 
 -Do humans help each other? is human kind more prone to kindness or apathy? 
 -Subtle commentary on reality tv. 
 There is a lot of material to think about after you read it. 
 That's why I appreciate Tana so much. She leads us to think about the best and worst of humanity. 
 Anyway, I greatly recommend this book for anyone who can tolerate vampire books. This book hails back to Pre-Twilight vampire books and mythology. So go into expecting a character study, not a heavy plot and you will enjoy it."
3,"I don't know about this series. I probably won't continue on, unless I find the next volumes for a bargain price or from the library. Kind of confusing and not really my thing. I mean I guess it's refreshing to see women cursing and having meaningless sex like male mercenaries (backwards stereotyping, I'm aware), but I feel like it was added just for the sake of story, for a slight ""shock factor"" to show how cool and kickass the ladies are. 
 I wasn't impressed as a comics novice, but I didn't hate it either. Kind of average, but still worth a read if you happen upon a volume."
5,"Really thought provoking. I always had it on my to-read list but there was always something else to choose. Finally I noticed this title mentioned by my favourite blogger, who wrote that this is the book she would recommend to someone to broaden his mind. This cought my attention. 
 When I finished Handmaid's Tale I was in a mood for something similarly not pleasant and in totalitarian mood so I immediately grabbed Fahrenheit 451. 
 It's scary. It's scary how true it is. How it describes us all staring at the computer or television screens, how we come back home from work and we don't want to read or watch anything toughing or important ""because we are tired"" so we watch Avengers and feel completely happy and justified. We thing it's snobbish to pronounce something right, to read many books, to actually think. And we are afraid and angry at everything slightly different, we want to put a huge, exact-same smile on everything and continue existing in comfort and without any concern or guilt. 
 This is what we are and what we continue to be and this is what is most easily controlled because it's predictable. I fear what we are but I'm also full of hope that there are and always will be people like Guy, ready to throw everything away and fight for the idea, for freedom, for what feels right even if it's not the easier way. 
 This book shows how easy it is to manipulate people and how many people want to be manipulated instead of risking, making decisions and regretting. And it also shows how full one feels when one thinks, does things, creates and cares. For this feeling we should never give up. Because, even if in a thousand years, we can make things right if we don't forget."
4,"A beautiful story about family, religion, and first love. As usual, the way Thompson tied together the different threads of his story was fantastic. Glad I took the time to read this one."
2,"I didn't dislike this book, but I didn't actually like it very much either. A literary dystopic novel, it is well written, but full of problems. First and foremost, the narration: it's in a very weird first-person plural style, told as if by the single resident of the community Fan left behind (but referring to himself in the plural as ""we""). This by itself wouldn't be a bad thing, but this unnamed narrator is essentially omniscient, with no way of knowing the tale that is told, or the detail...unless the narrator simply has some bits of truth and has woven a complete fiction. Further, the story itself is a chain of coincidences, and ultimately not very believable when taken as a whole. The character of Fan is pretty much a cipher. Maybe she was supposed to be an Everywoman, simply carried along by events and coincidence, but the narrator(s) seem to argue against that at many points, seemingly calling out how special she is/was. Finally, there's the issue of story elements being brought up, and then simply dropped or left unresolved, as if to say the details are unimportant. I'm writing this 15 minutes after finishing, so maybe my reaction will change with time, but for now, I'd have a hard time recommending this."
4,"This is epic, heroic fantasy set in a singularly unique world. The sky differs from place to place depending on the god of the region, which is a neat element in the story. Temur, Samarkar and their little group get caught up in a perilous adventure that is much larger than Temur's desire to find his stolen lover and avenge his brother. 
 The characters are well fleshed out. The main group include Temur, more at home on horseback than afoot; Samarkar, once princess and newly raised wizard, Hrahima, a tiger-woman with her own secrets, and a silent monk gifted in martial arts. And of course the steppe pony, who is the real hero of the group. 
 The book is filled with adventure, politics and the related schemes and plots, and a power hungry bad guy I can't wait to see get his just desserts."
3,"Objectively, I wasn't a huge fan of 'The Sky is Everywhere' its characters or plot. Lennie is our typical YA girl - she has a lot of quirky characteristics, but (or maybe even because of that) she never felt real to me. Moreover, the storyline is quite thin: girl, grieving over her sister's death, gets caught up in a love triangle. I had read 'I'll Give You The Sun,' also by Jandy Nelson, last summer, and I think she managed to pull off in that novel what didn't work for 'The Sky Is Everywhere:' Jude and Noah felt real, their stories were complex and amazingly crafted; Lennie's just felt a little plain and simple in comparison. 
 However, I still really enjoyed my reading experience. Nelson's prose is light and funny but not overly simplistic, and the book's design is very nice. It's an easy read, but still manages to tug at your heart strings. That's why I will always choose YA over chicklits: they're light and easy to read, but still carry a lot of emotional depth. 
 Overall I found this to be a charming and touching YA book, even though it doesn't have the best storyline you will ever read. If I'd have to choose I liked 'I'll Give You The Sun' a lot better, but I'm glad I read this one as well."
3,"""I smile up at him. ""It's beautiful. But what comes next?"" 
 ""The best part."" And he pulls me back into his arms. ""The happily ever after."" 
 My rating for this book is 3 stars, at first I gave it 5 stars but that was because I had just finished reading the book and I was exaggerating with 5 stars. I was so ecstatic when I got this book from my library, the cover wasn't what I was expecting but it is still really nice. This one was sadly the least of my favorites from this series, Anna was the best, then it was Lola and now Isla. That would be the order I would have them in. I think my favorite part was near the ending but that isn't good because the part at the near end wasn't really focused on Isla, I was glad to see Anna and Lola and I loved seeing them all together. That was may favorite part but not because of Isla's role in that part but because of Anna and St. Clair but the ending was adorable nonetheless. 
 - Isla 
 I found Isla annoying at times, overreacting to things in the worst way and seeing her just falling over this guy is a little depressing. I did like her character though, she was a nice mc but it was a little hard to concentrate because she did whine at many times and now that I look back at the book I am realizing all the flaws it had. I guess I was expecting so much I overlooked the bad parts and only focused on the good parts because Stephanie Perkin's is a great writer. Isla has to be my least favorite out of the three between her, Anna and Lola. She had high expectations for so many things that weren't just going to happen. 
 - Josh 
 I have to admit that I loved Josh. I always love reading about artists but still, what did he expect when he gave her that book in the beginning of your ex? It was very predictable of what was going to happen after she read it but his shock was just too much. But all of his characteristics are just to die for. 
 Overall, I thought the ending was amazing though, that was the cutest thing ever but the story dragged and was at such a slow pace. It felt as though nothing really happened through the book everything going on a short period of time. This was just unrealistic. Falling in ""love"" with someone over just a month? That is very unbelievable and honestly at least there was such realistic things going on in Anna and Lola's story, but where did it go? Things happened in the weirdest way. I am only really keeping this at 3 stars because I do believe it was adorable and it was a Stephanie Perkin's book so I finished the book pretty fast. I didn't like how this series ended, I really wish this book was a little better."
3,"Two months later, I still think about this book a lot. 
 I go back and reread passages. 
 In my original review, I wasn't happy with Sal and how she stereotyped German food-stuff as insults. Maybe time has dulled my outrage, but all the bad stuff has filtered away and I'm left with the good. This is a keeper."
5,"This book has to be one of my all time favorites. Though I didn't really like ""1984"" by the same author, this book was most enjoyable. The characters are semi relatable, though some of them tend to grow on you as the story progress. The story line was fantastic and I absolutely loved how he took a real life scenario and made it easier for the audience to understand. Overall I can not express how much I love this book."
5,"The Witches was tied for my favorite Roald Dahl book as a kid. I couldn't wait to read it to my own daughters. But then, it turned out Gwennie was quite sensitive, so we didn't read it for a couple years. Even now, Liz (my wife), was a touch concerned that she wasn't ready for it - but she was. 
 We started reading this in August, but it worked out perfectly for the review, because it's October, and we just got back from a pumpkin-painting party. 
 We tried something different this time, too. Gwennie asked to be quizzed at the end of each chapter. As you can imagine, all the kids were soon asking for their own questions. 
 Dad: What'd you think of the quiz questions, El? 
 Eleanor: I think they were pretty good. 
 D: Should we do them again next time we read a book? 
 El: Yeah! 
 Dad: Poppy, Gwen, what about you guys? 
 Poppy: I liked the quiz questions. 
 Dad: I know that you liked them, Gwennie. Do you know how I know you liked them? 
 Gwen: Because I asked for them! 
 Dad: Yep! So, how many stars? 
 All: Five!!!! 
 Poppy: I mean SEVEN!!!!!!!! 
 Dad thinking:... Every time... 
 Dad: So, favorite parts? 
 *Mild spoilers from here on out. You've been warned. * 
 . 
 . 
 El: I liked it when he turned into a mouse. 
 Poppy: My favorite part was when Bruno ate a banana. 
 Dad: That's an interesting part. Why is that your favorite part? 
 Poppy: Because I like bananas, and because bananas are healthy for us. 
 Dad: Gwennie what about you? 
 Gwen: I liked it when Grandmamma told the boy about the witches. What was his name? 
 El: I don't think they mentioned his name in the whole story. 
 Dad: I think you're right. 
 El: What was your favorite part dad? 
 Dad: That's a good question. What IS my favorite part? I liked it when they were describing the witches. I also liked it when the boy was hiding from the witches and he saw them for the first time. 
 Dad: Gwennie, do you think the story was too scary for you? 
 Gwennie: Nah. 
 Dad: Do you recommend it to anybody? 
 All: Yes. 
 Gwen: Oui! *She's been studying French.* 
 El: The book gave me a good kind of scare. 
 Dad: Have any of you had a good kind of scare before? 
 Gwen ( jumping on Eleanor's trampoline and singing): Yes, Yes, yes, yes yes yes. 
 El: I can't remember at this exact moment. But I don't think so. 
 Dad: Gwen, when did you? 
 Gwen: Um... At school. 
 El: When at school? 
 Gwen: I forget what day, but I know that it was 2016.... ... 
 Dad:... Well what happened? 
 Gwen: Well, at school there was, um, people told me about clowns. Then I got afraid. And then we went home, and I told mom. It really scared me and I was scared a lot, when I went to the bathroom the doors were shut and I was scared that a clown was hiding and he was going to come out and scare me and I was really really really scared. 
 Dad: But is that a good kind of scared? 
 Gwen: No. That's scared in a bad way. 
 Dad: But Eleanor said that this book made her feel scared in a good way. Has that ever happened to you Gwen? Where you're happy about being scared? 
 Gwen: Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah! I remember. I'm picturing it in my head. It was when professor was about to attack me and and I was really scared but I was also kind of laughing too. 
 Dad: Professor is our cat, in case you were wondering. Poppy, was the book too scary for you? 
 Poppy: Uh-huh! ...I mean, no. (Which she said in a scared voice.) 
 Dad: Are you sure? 
 Poppy: I'm sure! 
 Dad: I guess it's time for the next book."
3,***There might be minor spoilers. Be warned.*** It was okay but nothing near as good as the first 2. Julian is boring and mostly wimpy. Alex was a jerk and I didn't feel like I knew his character at all anymore. I didn't speed through this book like I did the other two. It wasn't too difficult to put it down :(
3,"RATING: / 3 enjoyable but not-quite-spectacular stars. 
 REVIEW: I'm a Kristen Ashley addict. Just thought I'd get that out of the way at the beginning. She's probably my only auto-buy author, not because there aren't other authors that I love or in fact love more than KA, but because I am always in the mood for one of her books. Always. Plus, on Kindle, they're incredibly affordable. And if you've made it to book 5 in this series then you're probably just as enamored with KA as I am. 
 Midnight Soul makes a couple twists on this series that has it standing apart from the previous four books. First, is that our male lead is from our universe and thus follows that the female lead is from the parallel universe. And second is that our destination is also reversed, being that the end goal is to set up life here in our exhaust filled world of pizza and indoor plumbing...you can imagine how fun this turns out to be. 
 I loved the beginning because we get Franka's origin story. She is such a strong character, as is all of KA's femmes, though in different ways, but Franka's haughty air struck a particularly strong chord with me. I adored her from first till last page and even teared up a lot during the first chapters. As for Noc, he's the rough talking, compassionate eyed hero that frequents most of Ashley's reality based novels. And of course he's perfect for Franka. 
 While this book was fun, in my opinion, it dragged a tad in the middle and toward the end. The story fractures a bit to focus on a couple other threads that, while interesting, felt a bit off kilter and not entirely satisfying. It's a 645 page book, so there's a lot that gets put into the story, but the best was in the beginning, and at times the later parts felt like filler. I know that the author was tying up the series and possibly trying to just fit all the little tid-bits that might interest us into this book, but it wasn't entirely successful. 
 Oh, and who else has read this and thought for part of the book that Franka's ""this-world"" twin might be Frankie from the fifth Burg-series book? The similarities in circumstance and attitude were uncanny. But we come to learn that that isn't true, and I'm only ""spoiling"" that because I wish I had learned that sooner so that it wasn't flitting around in the back of my brain and distracting my reading, so therefore I'll tell you now that Franka's twin isn't any of our other heroines from KA books. 
 All in all, it was an enjoyable book but not spectacular. Still, I love KA books and will continue to read them all!"
4,"Lovely cast of characters (Mr. R was a bit bland--but maybe the right amount of bland for a lawyer?), compelling linked stories about finding an identity (or having an identity forced upon you), and a propulsive plot. My one gripe is that--due to the number of characters--the book ended up dropping its focus on some of them for too long. Pearl, for instance, seems to be slowly replaced by Izzy as the book moves on. 
 (Team Izzy, obviously.)"
5,I am enjoying this series more than the Mortal Instruments. The characters are just so engaging.
1,"DNF @ 36% 
 I'm really interested in the story, i want to know what happens, i want to know if King can get really bad... 
 But the heroine... Jeez. This woman was a professional, yet she was thick as shit. Her inner monologue was killing me slowly. 
 I re-attempted it, but i couldn't do it. Heroine was a stuttering dumbass."
5,"I remember reading this book in 4th grade, and falling completely in love with it and reading. It was the first book that made me cry, and made me realize that books were more than cute stories to entertain."
2,"*sigh* sure it was hot and kinky, but truthfully I'm still bored by this series. Probably because I find it jumpy and disjointed sometimes. I also feel that a Silvio POV could have made any of these books that much better. 
 I'll read the next one since I'm this far in, but note it's pretty much only because of the writing and beautiful editing."
3,"3.5 stars 
 This is my 5th Shannon Hale book but my first in quite a while. I read with a more critical eye now, but I ended up enjoying this book a lot. I hadn't noticed before this book how nicely the author can turn a phrase. I liked the 'mucker' way the narrator spoke. It seemed true to her character and she used that dialect in the narration, which I enjoyed reading. Some of her descriptions were just wonderful and I had to take a second to turn them over in my mind and wish I'd written them myself (ex: ""The air was ice that seemed ready to break under my fist."" p261). She can describe something in succinct, vivid ways that fit the narrator but that I'd never think of. I was able to enjoy her writing style much more now than I did when I read her other books and didn't notice good/bad writing. 
 Although I'm not a reader of trends and usually avoid whatever is trending now, as it seems to flood the market and the quality goes way down, I don't mind reading a Shannon Hale fairy tale retelling. Although it seems that many YA and a few adult authors are jumping on the bandwagon, Hale has always written in this niche (ever since Goose Girl, the first of her books I read) so she's more of a forerunner than following the current trend. If she wrote another trend, such as dystopian, I'd stay away. But she's wonderful at the fairy tale reimagining, and I'm glad that she set the standard for the current trend. I hope she does well. She's a deserving author. 
 Overall, a good book that felt very authentic. I'd recommend to anyone interested in fairy tales, reimagined fairy tales, and YA historical fiction set in Asia."
4,puppy LOVE! can't wait for the next book!!
4,Okay this one is fun for its sarcastic nature. I plays with the librarian stereotype (horn rimmed glasses and buns included). I don't know how interesting it would be to non-librarians because I find myself getting tired of the main character's attitude and the way the narrator constantly breaks into the story. It is a fun read. Recommend it to teens who like adventure stories and sarcasm. Some violence. First in possible series.
5,"Fun, sexy, and heartwarming. Loved it!"
4,Rating: 3.5 Stars
5,"First of all, I was blown away that this book was written from a dog's perspective. After dozens and dozens of books, I was totally caught off guard by it. It was so unique and yet so well done. Kudos to Mr. London. Second of all, I started to see myself as the dog, and (pardon my waxing religious) I started to see his various masters as God. When Buck the dog gets whipped into shape, I was there getting whipped into shape. I was there when he had to learn from experience, to go without, to work harder, to trust his master, to obey without question, to love and serve, to protect and be loyal to the point of adoration. This book really became something apart. Something so unique and touching to me in the transitions of his life that mirrored my own. 
 So, is ""wild"" the call to our true nature, or to savageness? Buck moves from a regular lazy dog to his most untamed self, but he only gets there after learning discipline--he's not wild because he can do whatever he wants, he's wild because he has found his true self, his true calling. He's good at it, he loves it, and he totally owns it. Awesome book."
5,"Lovely. Strange. Romantic. Magical. 
 The stories here weave in and out of each other, lives brushing past lives, affecting each other more or less, then moving on or circling round to brush again. The central romance was lovely, and I was so pleased with how Morgenstern arranged the ending. 
 I listened to the marvelous Jim Dale read this and, despite being distracted early on by the similarity of the character voices to some he created for his reading of the Harry Potter series, I felt like this was a wonderful format for the book. Reading on paper I might have rushed through the descriptive passages more and failed to enjoy the detail and mystery of the settings. Listening, I was able to savor the lyrical beauty of Morgenstern's writing. The only drawback, aside from the fact that winter weather kept me from the walking trail for days and the sporadic listening sometimes caused things to seem a bit disjointed, was that without a physical book to flip back and forth in I occasionally had a hard time keeping track of the dates. For my next reading (this is definitely one I plan to reread) I have a hard copy, and I look forward to having a clearer idea of where scenes fall in the back and forth of the narrative. This minor confusion didn't really affect my enjoyment of the story, but I did sometimes wish I could remember whether one scene occurred earlier or later than another."
4,"Wonderful exquisite writing! You don't have much to go on.. Because reading this was like being left in the dark. And some books don't transition between being able to grasp your attention. Thankfully this isn't that type of book because I was invested whole-heartedly. This was such a major journey for our main character and I was there along with her. Some questions are answered by the end, but I needed and wanted so much more. Especially how the Book came to be. Why are these people so special? What is the purpose of the Book? Or the Guard? Or even the Assassin?? 
 Sefia trying to grasp the knowledge that was found in the Book made my heart jump for joy. Reading through a character's eyes, and having her learn how to read was a great experience. I can't imagine a world without books, and I really liked how the author tackled this one. There was also a lot of swashbuckling with a group of pirates that I liked. At first you'll be awfully confused because there are sub-plots and plethora of characters, but they're mentioned so frequently that you don't seem to forget them. There is also a slow-burn romance which I loved. At first, I was liking the fact that they didn't fall madly in love, and then it just changed because of what they experienced. Archer just seemed like a wonderful match for Sefia. I too enjoyed the characters and their magical powers because what was being said and what was being done confused me to no end. There's a lot of world building questions so I'm hoping there's going to be a second book with the answers. 
 I am loving the diverse POCs and even this cover, but did they really have to use a computer animated render instead of a model? Or is having a photo of a POC model on a book's cover too much to ask? She looks too Photoshopped and it doesn't seem to stand out. I've been really ripping apart books with white washed covers or lack of diverse representation, so I am sorry if I'm just being a little too critical. 
 Overall, I enjoyed ""The Reader"", and as far as pirate action adventures go, this one was a great read!

 If they're important as I think they are, everything is relevant. 
 There's enough death in this world. I want to help things grow. 
 Sometimes you get what you want. And sometimes you wished you hadn't. 
 Control your future, or let your future control you. 
 Maybe I could make a difference before my time ran out. Maybe I'd matter. 
 What you do makes you who you are. 
 What I mean is, we're free. We choose what we want to do and who we want to be. Sometimes you gotta fight hard for it, but it's worth it, to choose for yourself. 
 Sometimes you find things and you wish you hadn't. Sometimes you wish they'd stayed lost."

4,"*read for the 2016 reading challenge: a book from Oprah's Book Club* 
 3.5 stars"
3,"This was my first Rainbow Rowell book ever. In the book we follow two characters: Eleanor and Park. Eleanor is a ""big redhead"" - she knows that she could lose some weight and she basically doesn't have any self-consciousness. Park is a half-Korean boy. When Eleanor starts attending the same school as Park does, they start to get closer to each other. 
 It is a nice, touching story, but I hate when there is an issue of domestic abuse and nobody! tries to deal with that. I seriously hate Ritchie and Eleanor's mom - because she could do so many things! She could have a nice life with her children... nice and calm life. But she is blind to everything! I seriously hate such frustrating characters! 
 As for the story itself, it's a nice romance of the first love. It shows how deep it can be, it shows a glint of hope for Eleanor... because who would have ever thought that such a big girl should be pretty for someone? I must say that I expected a different ending. 
 Overall, I enjoyed the book but it wasn't anything special. I listened to it on audio book and I prefered Eleanor's voice much more than Park's - Park's voice sometimes annoyed me."
4,Not bad. Even though there was an 'ending' it left us with a huge cliffhanger. Come on #4!
5,Loved this series. Great ending. No time to write proper review :B
3,"This book was not what I expected. The cover and mantra made me think of a woman suffering from depression who is just trying to get through every day, telling herself that it will be different. 
 This isn't that, but I didn't actively dislike it as a result. The main character isn't depressed, she just on this particular day has decided to try to improve, to be more positive, and the day turns out to be pretty trying in the scheme of her overall mundane life, but I think this mantra she decided on helps her through. 
 Some might see the main character as unlikable, but, and this will sound weird, I kind of liked her unlikableness. She had the kind of vaguely unkind honesty that goes through our own minds on occasion but that we don't share and don't say out loud. She's easy to relate to - thinks she should be a little thinner, thinks she should be a better mom, thinks she should be a better wife, thinks she should be a better friend, and just is trying to take this little baby step of saying ""I'll be better today"" to get there. 
 It's been several days since I finished though, and I'm still not sure how I feel about the ending. I don't think I was bothered by the reveal of the family-drama mini-mystery, but I think perhaps the main character responded in a way I found to be inconsistent with my perception of her character. 
 Overall, this is a character growth story. The plot isn't really that complex. The setting isn't original. I'm sure a lot of people would read this and go, ""Why did I read this? What was the point? Nothing HAPPENED?"" But despite this, I liked seeing the human struggles of an ordinary woman in a single day."
5,"This is hilarious, especially if you're up for self-deprecating characters. Gotta love this duo of Clint Barton and Kate Bishop; they play off each other really well. I really liked the artwork on stories #1-3, but not so much #4-5. The storylines and shenanigans were a non-stop thrill ride. 
 Also, Pizza Dog:"
2,"Lauren Groff is a problem for me. I abandoned her first novel, The Monsters of Templeton, after 75 pages, because I was bored to tears. I would have abandoned this one, too, but it was a book club selection and therefore as mandatory to finish as homework. 
 This book is about Bit Stone, a kid raised in a hippie commune whose de facto leader is a musician who seems decidedly shady. The commune predictably collapses into chaos after a drug raid, and then the narrative turns to Bit as an adult. There are more drugs, there is degenerative illness, there is a worldwide epidemic of apocalyptic proportions. All this is told in prose that is often arrestingly beautiful. 
 What doesn't this book have? An ounce of emotion. The consensus in my book club was that the book viewed all of its characters from a distance, and the effect was beautiful but chilly. 
 Part of the problem for me might be a matter of expectations. The McGuffin of her books is so intriguing (a Loch Ness monster; cultish hippies) that it leads me to believe I'm in for a great story. But Groff is not a storyteller. She is, apparently, an artiste."
4,"As far as the relationship goes in this story, it is more based on if they are willing to face the consequences of people finding out about their relationship. Ty had left at the end of the last book, and Zane doesn't know where he want off too. He isn't handling it very well and is very distract over it. He isn't the best person to be working along with at this time. He is in a big ball of emotions over Ty. Does he just want to punch his lights out, yell at him until he is hoarse, or just jump in his arms and his him until the end of days? 
 One of Burns oldest friends comes to him for help. Their is shady things going down in the government and Burns is willing to put his best men on retrieving the only man who can help, Jullian Cross. Cross is up their with Ty, as far as being a badass. He also has a male lover, Cam. So Burns calls in Zane and sends him off to help. That is how they are reunited. 
 But of course it isn't fun and games. As Zane and Ty are working on their relationship, more in depth, they are in charge of getting Cross back to DC. Cross isn't going to go willing and won't go anywhere without Cam. So they start their travels back to DC. As the four men are traveling, they all learn more than they started out as. People are out to track them down. Not everything is what it seems. 
 Also, Zane and Ty try their hardest to hide their relationship from Cross and Cam. But sometimes hiding something so strong as their love is harder than it seems. 
 This was fun book to read. Their was lots of action and you can't not help but fall in love with Cross and Cam. Cross could be Ty's brother in arms. Well they have similarities they also have their differences. I would love to see more about this couple in a spin off."
3,"Fairy tale retellings are one of my 'things,' so I had to pick this up when I came across it on the library shelf. I haven't read anything else by this Pulitzer Prize-winning author, so I can't compare this to his other writings. 
 The stories collected here are very consistent in 'feel' throughout. Each takes a fairy tale (or other well-known tale), and injects it with a dash of the modern-day (without wholly removing its more 'classic' elements), and twists the story a bit in order to accentuate the ironic, and perhaps make a bitter comment on humanity. There aren't a lot of happy endings to be found here. 
 Dis. Enchant. 
 This very brief piece on the theme of 'ordinary' people being resentful and jealous of the 'extraordinary' sets the tone of the book very well. If you like this piece, I'd recommend continuing. If you don't - the book might not be for you. 
 A Wild Swan 
 Based on: The Wild Swans: http://hca.gilead.org.il/wild_swa.html 
 All happens as it did in the Andersen tale - the brothers transformed, the sister who works to rescue them from the curse. But the author focuses on what happened to the one brother who was left with a swan's wing; transposing him in his trauma from the fantasy castle to a contemporary setting of bars full of alcoholic, depressed victims of curses. 
 Crazy Old Lady 
 Based on: Hansel and Gretel 
 The woman who focused on sex and good times while all her friends were getting married and settling down always dreamed of being a 'Mrs. Robinson'-style cougar in her later years. To her dismay, as she ages, she realized the boys just aren't interested. A bit unhinged, she decides to build a candy-and-gingerbread cottage. What eventually happens mirrors what happened to the witch in Hansel and Gretel a bit more closely than she expected. But the kids who visit her are no innocents. 
 Jacked 
 Based on: Jack and the Beanstalk 
 Here, the classic story is infused with plenty of authorial commentary on topics such as how very foolish it is to entrust your last cow to an 'imbecilic son' who'd trade it to a stranger for a handful of beans. It also comments on the very questionable morality of everything Jack does, although his burglaries and thefts certainly allow he and his mother to buy private planes, remote island, and limited edition Murakami Louis Vuitton handbags. 
 Poisoned 
 Based on: Snow White 
 After rescuing Snow White from her glass coffin, the prince develops a pervy obsession. 
 A Monkey's Paw 
 Based on: the W.W. Jacobs story, of course. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mon...) 
 The twist is: What if they didn't use the third wish to send away the rotted corpse of their son? What if they invited him back anyways? 
 The story becomes a disturbing digression on the erosion of happiness. 
 Little Man 
 Based on: Rumplestiltskin 
 I've read other positive representations of the titular ugly 'little man' of the Rumplestiltskin story. Here, he is consumed by the desire to have a child: to be a good father and to pass on his knowledge to a new generation. His efforts to help a hapless girl spin straw into gold are motivated largely by kindness. But we all know what happens to a dream deferred... or denied. 
 Steadfast, Tin 
 Based on: Hans Christian Andersen's Steadfast Tin Soldier 
 A modern relationship is depicted here, which may mirror the tragic fairy tale in certain respects. At least, the woman in the relationship seems to think it does; and her daughter explicitly thinks that her mother used telling her the story as a way to try to explain her parents' relationship. 
 The story rather deftly questions the concept of destiny and true love, as it describes a troubled - but eventually 'steadfast' - marriage. 
 Beasts 
 Based on: Beauty and the Beast 
 Ooh, this was a twist on the story that I hadn't ever actually seen before. (And I've read a LOT of takes on this story.) I thought it worked really well, too. I might even say it was Angela Carter-worthy. Here, many events proceed as expected, with the additional information that Beauty herself might've been less meek and selfless, and more hopeless and frustrated than we thought. She professes her love for the Beast and breaks the spell... but have you ever considered WHY someone might've cast such a spell on the Beast? 
 Her Hair 
 Based on Rapunzel 
 Beginning where the story usually ends, this shows us a blind man at the fulfillment of his long and arduous quest to find his love. The short piece quickly becomes a metaphor about how we all sometimes hide certain things in relationships, to keep others happy. 
 Ever/After 
 I guess Cunningham didn't want to end the book on a low note, because this original fairy tale of an arranged royal marriage that works out surprisingly well is a love letter to life, with all its quotidian warts and travails. 
 Note: The illustrations here, by Yuko Shimizu, are exquisite. Simple, stark black-and-white, like something from a less-perverse Aubrey Beardsley. I couldn't help feeling like they belonged to a less earthy, more transcendent collection of fairy tales, though."
4,"I loved the dry humor. For me, the first half of the book was more engaging than the second half of the book. Of course, the entire time I read the book it made me think of the 1976 movie, The Omen. If you like clever satire and end-of-the world, armageddon type scenarios, you might really enjoy this. However, it's not an action-take its more of a head-trip."
3,"Fun, but I never got quite as into it as I did the first installment. I also think it could have gone even further with... how to put it... ""queering the subtext""."
5,"4.5 stars 
 What I loved: 
 -so many female characters! 
 -Assassin nuns! It is important, when killing a nun, to ensure that you bring an army of sufficient size. 
 -the friendships! 
 -Nona is just amazing 
 -Nona is bisexual (it's canon! she has had crushes on girls and boys) 
 -(view spoiler)[Side queer couple! But... we don't know if Kettle is alive at the end of the book? Did I miss something? I really do not want to start the next book and discover that the author decided to bury a lesbian (hide spoiler)] 
 -THE BLADE PATH 
 What I didn't love: 
 -the worldbuilding is imaginative but gets confusing at times; there are some infodumps 
 -the pacing is really slow."
5,"This is storytelling at it's best. Right from page one, the circus is brought to life by talking to you, the reader, as if you were actually there. 
 ""What kind of circus is only open at night?"" people ask. ... You are amongst them, of course. Your curiosity got the better of you.... 
 -Erin Morgenstern, The Night Circus pg 3 
 Nothing in this story was random - not even the objects on the desk. Everything meant something in this complex story and it was a joy to watch it all come together in such great ways. The dialogue is funny and witty which reminded me of Downton Abbey since they are set in similar time periods. I absolutely loved the writing. There is such gorgeous and vivid imagery. And I found this character description particularly charming: 
 August turns out to be a pleasant, heavyset fellow and Bailey's first impression is that he resembles his house: a squat sort of building with a porch wrapping around the front, warm and welcoming. 
 -Erin Morgenstern, The Night Circus pg 332 
 The romance in this book was exquisite. The girl is abused. The boy is neglected. One is taught by experience and the other by books. I loved watching how they connect. They balance each other in a way that makes them be so much more when they are together than when they are apart. This is a story about how love is more powerful than fighting. The circus becomes an amazing symbol of their love. The ending was so perfect. There was love and loss - anything else would have been a crime against the story. 
 I loved the twist on magic. It was mystical, dreamlike, and mysterious but at the same time there was a feeling that magic could be learned by everyone if you could really see the world without judgement. And the reason that magic has slowly disappeared is because there are no more secrets anymore. The idea of the magic contained in secrets made me think about if The Night Circus had a modern setting, it wouldn't have had the same mystery and thrill to it. The existence of twitter alone would have completely ruined the excitement and magic of the circus. It made me realize that there really is magic in secrets. 
 The characters were a delight. I loved the stage magician that could do real magic. There's a boy that runs away to the circus and somehow it's not cliche. And that same boy dreams of being a princess in a fairy tale that gets whisked away from his problems. I found that so completely endearing. I wanted to be one of the reveurs that follow the circus like addicted fangirls. 
 Overall, this was a magical and unique love story that delighted me from start to finish.

5,I mean... There are no words! This book was amazing and I loved soaking up every single moment of it.
3,"My initial reaction when I began reading All the Missing Girls was intrigue and a little bit of loss because of the nonlinear/reverse chronology. Telling the story in such a way was unique, but I feel that I would have enjoyed it more had it been in chronological order. I found myself trying to hurry to reach the end because going backwards was driving me a little crazy. The ""buildup"" and anticipation was definitely there though! Overall, I enjoyed reading this book and I found myself liking some of the characters although a few of them frustrated me on occasion. A little more backstory on some of the supporting characters would have been nice, but I could see how adding more could have taken away from the main story line of the book."

4,"I've wanted to read this book for awhile. It's one of those books/titles that people mention a lot (like The Sea of Tranquility....which I still haven't read yet). Overall, it was pretty good, albeit a bit confusing at times (the beginning of chapter 34 I had to read a couple of times until I understood what really was going on). I also almost threw my Kindle off the bed at the end of chapter 32! Not cool! I really liked the story and Bred and Archer's back stories. That made them perfect for each other. Travis was a despicable bad guy most of the book, and I was impressed that I hadn't completely figured out all of Archer's story until it was all revealed. 
 I look forward to reading Mia Sheridan's other books. One thing that I realized after I read Archer's Voice, is that this book and all the books in the ""A Sign of Love"" series are inspired by mythological/astrological beings and stories. This one is inspired by Sagittarius. After I found this out, I looked up Sagittarius and his story. I was impressed with the things that Sheridan incorporated to connect Archer and Sagittarius' stories. I like that kind of stuff in the books I read. :-)"
5,"Why arent you reading this? If you have time to read this review, you have time to read SAGA."
5,"Wow. Just. Wow. 
 I got this book from the library a couple of weeks ago. I knew that it was about a girl with Pure-O (Purely Obsessional) Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, which intrigued me because I have the same disorder, or at least something similar. I thought that Every Last Word was a little slow at first, but I was still really into it because I loved the way it wasn't just about her OCD. At some points, it just seemed like a typical teen-falling-in-love story, which is important because mental disorders are not a person's whole life. Normal things happen to mentally ill people every day, and they deal with normal teenage problems just like everyone else. Maybe the scenes of AJ and Sam kissing went on a little too long, and I'm so over guys who play guitar, but I bought the relationship at least. 
 I really can't go into what I like most about this book because it is a huge spoiler that would completely ruin the book for you if you haven't read it yet, and it is an incredible twist. Once I got to the part that reveals it, I read like a maniac until I had finished the book and came straight here to write about it. But I can't really write about it, because you have to experience it for yourself. It's so good and so heartbreaking that I was nearly in tears, and I never cry at books besides Harry Potter. I was tempted to be annoyed by the fluffiness of the poetry group and the improbability of a number of things, but the ending made up for anything that I disliked about the book. I want to say that the whole Poet's Corner group seems so unreal, like that would never happen, but maybe that's just me being cynical because I would have killed for a group like that in high school. I don't like poetry all that much, but I really think I would have fit right in with them. Something like that would have really helped me. God, I'm just in so much pain for Caroline right now, and she's just a fictional character. Just, please read this book. That's all I can say.

2,"Book #3 of the booktube-a-thon! 
 I really wanted to like this and in parts I really did. I don't know if it's the fact I whizzed through it or just that it was not the best book. 
 This may be the first book in which I've thought the film was significantly superior. Although, it was interesting to see where the 'man on the run' films all came from."
4,"Less sexist and more focused on the action, it could have been my favorite Peter Grant but there was something that didn't do it as much as the second book in the series. I guess it's because of jazz and the Soho, how can a girl resist that? 
 Anyway, it's interesting, it's easy to read and fun. I love to have Lesley back. 
 I like how the mythology is expanding and how we get to know new creatures every book."
3,"I found the first half of this book underwhelming: I thought too much time was spent in the present, which was very generic chick lit, and some aspects of the time travel bugged me (how easily the men accepted the presence of a time traveling modern woman and how incurious they were about the future, how neither Eva or Daniel struggle much with time travel logistically and/or philosophically). However I must confess the second half of the book won me over with its charm and sweetness, despite the narrative problems. This books grows on you, and Eva and Daniel have a blessedly warm, non-annoying romance. It is sort of thin and shallow but also genuinely heartwarming so I give it three stars for the emotional engagement I felt with the second half of the narrative and for the beautiful descriptions of Cornwall."
2,"I haven't seen the movie in years, but I grew up on it, and from what I remember the movie was nearly word-for-word the same as the book. This read like a Neil Gaiman book, but it was a little too whimsical and a little too poetic for my tastes. 
 Some of it was fun and pulled me in with it's descriptions. ""Mabruk's semblance of affability vanished like a spark on snow, and with the same sound."" ""[The gown:] did not fit her well. Molly Grue was an indifferent seamstress, and satin made her nervous."" A prince who rushes around being everyone's hero in every possible manner (slaying dragons and ogres etc etc). 
 Some of it was just overly poetic. ""Even as he spoke, a soundless step sounded in his eyes, and the sign of a satin gown troubled his face. The Lady Amalthea stood in the doorway."" Lots of references to seeing the forest and leaves in the unicorn's eyes. A castle description that is so bogged down in detail that I ended up skimming. 
 Overall it wasn't a terrible read, but I can't think of anyone I'd recommend it to."
5,LOVED this book! The only complaint I have is that it ended on a wicked cliffhanger and we have to wait a year for the next book!

 ARC via NetGalley. 
 Thank you, Entangled Teen! 
 Well, Lisa Brown Roberts... I'm becoming a fan. 
 A few weeks ago (maybe a little longer) I read ""Resisting the Rebel"" by this same author, and let me tell you, it was sooo good and sooo hot! Go read it. Here's my review in case you're still in doubt. 
 Anyway... when I saw ""The Replacement Crush"" had been written by Mrs. Roberts too I immediately developed a serious case of *grabby hands*. I wanted it, and I wanted it bad. Thankfully I got it and it didn't disappoint. 
 TRC is the story of book blogger Vivian, who's a romance addict (hello!) and works at the bookstore helping her mother. Vivian's life revolves around books (hello!), her awesome friends and a crush who broke her heart. The idiot spent all summer kissing her, but as soon as classes started again he pretended he didn't even know her and moved on to his next target. Devastated, Vivian starts a mission intending on getting over that heartbreak: find a replacement crush. 
 But Vivian didn't want to risk getting her heart broken all over again, so the main criteria for her RC was that they should have zero chemistry. That ruled out hot-nerd, new guy Dallas, a.k.a. McNerdy (because apparently Vivian watches Grey's Anatomy. How I miss the early seasons of that show!). 
 Dallas is everything you could ask for in a love interest. Mysterious, super smart, great sense of humor, too hot for his own good and a nice guy. Yep, teen me would totally fall for Dallas. 
 Of course Vivian did, too. While they spent time together while Dallas worked on bringing the bookstore into the computer-age, Vivian ended up falling for Dallas. But Vivian was stubborn and she didn't want to let go of her RC plan to give the boy who clearly liked her a chance. 
 See... Vivian could be a bit frustrating at times because she was really stubborn and made things more complicated for herself than she needed to, but she also had a great voice, which made reading about her a lot easier. None of her actions or reactions were bad enough that I wanted to stop reading, but there were a couple of times I wanted to shake some sense into her. 
 Dallas, on the other hand, was pretty perfect. I loved how nerdy and smart he was. How he kept trying to win Vivian over without being pushy. How he flirted with her and then... okay. No spoilers. But it was hot. Sure I was a little irritated at something he did when Vivian pushed him away, but it wasn't bad enough to ruin him for me. 
 Dallas and Vivian had great chemistry, which was both important because of the plot and because who doesn't like to read about characters with great chemistry? I'm coming to the conclusion that Mrs. Roberts writes romance in a way that speaks to me, because I always find her books have the kind of romance that's a little more intense and hotter than others from the same genre and publisher. 
 The rest of the characters were likable, especially best-friend-turned-big-brother, Toff and her successful-mystery-author mother. I loved Vivian's relationship with both of them, as well as the bromance between Toff and Dallas. 
 Overall, this was a pretty great read with lots of elements that spoke to me (hello, romance addict book blogger!) and the kind of romance that had me swooning hard. Okay, so when do I get a new book from Lisa Brown Roberts? How about right now?"
4,"This is definitely outside my usual reading choices, but it was an interesting read. I was just going along, not caring much about any of these people, until the very end - the last few ""chapters,"" or whatever you want to call them. Those got me. 
 This is a case of - I can 100% see why this is highly rated, and won an award (maybe more than one? Can't remember), it just wasn't my style. 
 Counts for my summer reading challenge."
2,"After a terrifying car accident in which his mother disappears, presumed dead, Jacob goes to live with his white aunt and uncle in the midwest. It's a hard transition for him, made harder by his classmates' racism and his own burgeoning magic powers. I would have liked this a lot more without the infodumps about magic, not least because the magic has an unexpectedly Christian basis. And this contains two of my least favorite aspects of Christianity: some people are born evil, and keeping people ignorant and then being angry when they make poor decisions based on their lack of knowledge. It seems unfair and counterproductive to lay down strange rules, provide no explanation for them, and then act angry when these (seemingly silly and inconsequential) rules get broken."
1,"Book's a disaster for Kate-Curran shippers. Their personalities just took a nose dive and almost made drop this series. Well, I did stop reading it after a couple of chapters (and after being warned by so many reviews). Ignorance is bliss, I guess. 
 This book shouldn't have been published at all."
4,"It's like 4.5. Four seems to little but give would be a blatant lie. 
 I'll write a full review in the future."
4,"Two older men/younger women taboo stories 
 Brandt's Cherry Girl: Brandt/37 and Kelsey/17. Brandt is Kelsey's fathers best friend. The taboo is that Kelsey grew up with ""Uncle"" Brandt. He's never looked twice at her until now when he comes back for a visit and possible new job opportunity. Brandt sees that Kelsey is all grown up now and I admit, I got a little whiplash with how fast he moved in on her. It was quick and it was dirty but that is what this author is known for. If you like the older man trope, this was a hot little read. 
 Sheriff's Bad Girl: Rick/37 and Mandy/17. Mandy is Kelsey best friend and she has a crush on Kelsey's father, Rick. Mandy is the ultimate bad girl lashing out because of an abusive father. Things come to a head when Rick allows Mandy to stay the night at his house when his daughter isn't there, because of a fight with Mandy's father. This was anther one that took a very quick turn. I didn't really care for this one as much but I think it's because of his understandable reactions to his daughter and best friends relationship. It was still a pretty hot read though."
5,OMG! What a clifhanger! Is it who I think it is? I just HAVE to get my hands on shadowfever!! Can't wait
5,"Review brought to you by OBS staff member Annabell 
 Beware of spoilers 
 Will there ever be a quiet and normal moment in Percy's life? Percy heads to freshmen orientation at the school where his mom's new boyfriend, Paul, teaches English. Right from the beginning Percy has a bad feeling the day isn't going to go so well and he couldn't have been more right! He meets up with Rachel, the mortal girl he almost killed with his sword at the Dam in Titan's Curse and who happens to able to see through the mist. Percy also ends up having to fight a gang of Empousai who are attempting to pass themselves as cheerleaders but are way uglier! In the process of fighting for his life, Percy ends up blowing up the school. More bad news comes Percy's way when he heads back to Camp Half-Blood and finds out Kronos is reforming with the aid of Luke. Luke has a plan to invade the camp, once thought of to be impenetrable. Percy, Annabeth, and Grover soon realize Luke is planning on using the Labyrinth from underground to get into the camp. Percy, Annabeth, and Grover head down into the Labyrinth to find its creator, Daedalu's, in the hopes of finding a way of stopping Luke. But Dadealu's doesn't have such great news for them: the Labyrinth cannot be controlled, it is constantly changing and tunnels can pop up wherever or close whenever the Labyrinth chooses. Percy must find a way to stop Luke before he loses the only place he has ever thought of as home. 
 The Battle of the Labyrinth was fantastic! I love the idea behind the maze and the story behind the creator. I like that it's a moving and living thing all on its own. It was great having Nico's character more involved in the story. I love how sarcastic and angsty he is because it works for his character. He's also a bit scary with his powers. Rachel Dare plays more of a role as well. I like the fact that Annabeth gets jealous of her relationship with Percy. It's fun to see a different side of Annabeth since she's always portrayed so confident and tough. Tyson is one of my favorite characters because he's just so loveable! 
 Lots more gods and monsters are also introduced throughout various stages in the plot. The backstory to how Annabeth was born finally comes to light and a very romantic moment between Annabeth and Percy takes place *nudge nudge* 
 The fourth installment is much different than the first three in the Percy Jackson Series because the tone is more serious and filled with more tragedy and consequence. Percy has to make harder decisions and readers can see how he has matured. He is much braver and wiser. 
 I love the dynamic to the relationships between the characters. The backstories intertwine nicely each other and how fiercely loyal Percy, Annabeth, Grover, and Tyson are with each other helps fuel the plot forward and add dimension to it. 
 I, for one, cannot get enough of Percy Jackson!

4,"A novella told from Puck's point of view? Sign me up! 
 I really enjoyed this one and possibly because of the change of view. We finally get to see into the minds of the boys - well, at least one of them. Throughout the first three books, Puck is the best friend, the comrade, the sidekick. He makes jokes, he laughs, he pulls pranks...but that's all on the surface. Deep down he's dealing with the fact that the girl he loves is in love with his best friend. A best friend who has taken a sworn oath to kill him. 
 I'm glad Kagawa let us see this glimpse into Puck. He's one of my fave characters and as much as I love Ash, I don't want Puck to get hurt. And I'm also secretly hoping for a Puck/Ash bromance reunion cause I can see the breadcrumbs leading us there. 
 Onto book 4!"
3,"It was definitely an interesting story. 
 It was a bit confusing with the amount of P.O.V. switches but it wasn't too hard to follow. I didn't really care about any of the characters, they were too one-dimensional. It would have been better if only ONE character had been focused on, or TWO stories. With four going, or maybe three, it was spread a bit too thinly. The fact that all of em were basically worried about falling in love and finding the girl their BFs cheated on them with instead of the world ending is a bit surprising. The fact that there were no looters or major riots or crimes is also quite shocking. 
 Bit unbelievable considering how violent a species we are."
4,"I follow her tumblr, so I was familiar with many of these stories. However, to see them organized in this way is a real treat. Definitely a book that gives you a little behind-the-scenes insight to the life of a public librarian!"
2,"I have to admit I'm still uncertain about how I feel towards this book. What got me first interested in this was the conflicting reviews I read here about the content of the book. Especially the relationship between the two protagonists. 
 I took me a while to get into the book because of the writing. Maybe it's because english is not first language, but it was hard for me follow the story sometimes. Most of the time I just wanted to skip through to later chapters. We weren't given much backstory to the characters, we know a little bit more about Lessa, how she ended up where she was before she was found by F'lar, the male protagonist, and why she is the way she is. The plot was hard to follow for me, especially the Threads threat I didn't get much, I admit, so the action was lost on me. But I did like the idea of the relationship the dragons and their riders have. The way they communicate with each other and are always in constant sync. I also liked the idea of travelling between times. 
 Now, about the relationship between the two main people, Lessa and F'lar, one thing I couldn't comprehend is the idea of F'lar shaking Lessa when he's upset with her. I just simply couldn't picture the motion in my head, don't know why. One other thing is the sex part. If I didn't read around that the riders mate with the riders of their dragons mate I don't think I could've understood that right away in the book. I didn't understand the rule, in fact, most rules, where they come from etc. The relationship didn't seem all too horrible to me, save for the shaking thing which I couldn't comprehend, and in fact, Lessa and F'lar both seemed a bit immature and childlike towards one another. It was like they were playing a weird couples game with one constantly shaking the other when not pleased and the other constantly whining and rebelling against whatever she can think of while they both yelled at and dared each other. I found myself liking a secondary character, F'Nor- the half-brother to F'lar and another dragon rider, much more than the others. I didn't get the much misogynist feel from this, considering the period and notion it was supposedly written against. I thought it might've been necessary to describe the men with a certain mind-frame against women while in the book they also come to terms, even if slowly and at times a bit grudginly, with the fact that women are a part of the war they fight against the enemy. 
 Overall, it was an ok book for me, one I couldn't quite connect with though."
4,"This book is heavy with the theme of what makes people 'good' and 'bad'. The rigid social divisions don't define it, the racial divisions don't, age divisions, gender, etc. I like how this book shows us how Scout essentially grows up, how she learns and develops her own morality with the events of the summer weighing in heavily. 
 The implications of our society and the racial struggles we are still faced with is depressing. We like to think we've come so far in the past 80 years, but have we really? The symbolism of the mockingbird was beautiful, and I like how it came full circle in the end."

 Breathtaking, tragic, climactic 
 A crazy murder classic. This is my first time to try a Christie novel but the suspense behind And Then There Were None got me shifting on my seat (quite intense criminology) as characters get killed by a mysterious murderer one by one. 
 When I read that Ten Little Indians poem, I knew it - in that part I'm right, however I still kept guessing who's who 'til the end (guess in some parts I didn't expect it coming) so big pat on the back to Agatha Christie for the mind games she gave me. In fact, her writing is easily adaptable despite the classic slang and prose because I enjoyed the conversations, the fast-paced comically-relevant murders, especially how she depicted each character very well in various tones, attitudes and ages. 
 I'll be reading more of her novels because of this! :) 
 So, will you come to the Indian island? 
 PS. Thanks Juks!"
5,I read this book when I was 13 and enjoyed the book. It was about this girl named Davey who had to move with her little brother and mom to move in with their aunt and uncle in New Mexico after her father was killed in a robbery at his store. She then meets this mysterious guy named Wolf who knows how she is feeling and tries to help her move on. I recommend this to all fans of YA. There is even a movie of this book out on DVD and it was pretty good as well but be sure to read the book first before you watch the film.
3,"Very character-driven like most of Hocking's stories, but there was just something missing from the story. The dialogue was just a bit unrealistic at times and there were things built up that were unnecessary. I liked the mythical aspects nonetheless and it was a quick read."
0,"I received an e-ARC from the publisher via NetGalley 
 This book definitely had strong points. The narrative alternated between Will's and Zoe's viewpoints, and it was never a problem to know whose head you were in. The setting was well-drawn -- as these two trekked cross-counry, I felt I was right with them in the convenience stores and cheap motels. 
 I also liked the fact that Nobody But Us doesn't try to romanticize the couple's terrible choices. In fact, I give the author credit for not being afraid to offer up two very flawed characters. While it would be hard not to feel sympathy for the all hardships these two have endured in their short lives, it was also hard for me to get attached to them when I felt they were doomed. 
 Watching the two of them drive cross-country became an exercise in dread. I clicked through the pages, wondering what kind of bad outcome I was going to get. I think if I had seen any small glimmer of hope, I would have found the book far more poignant. 
 If you love gritty contemporaries, you should definitely try Nobody But Us. If you like your stories to have some sense of happily ever after, this won't be the book for you.

2,"""I wondered if hell looked like this. A girl with no one, in a car, going no where."" 
 yeah, that's kind of how this book was for me. A girl with nothing..going nowhere. 
 Where to start. 
 I loved the idea. She drowned and stopped breathing for 11 minutes. 11 minutes her body shut down and stopped working. But she is a medical miracle. Because she woke up and, even though her brain charts say she should be having issues, she appears to have full function and complete memories of her life. 
 it's a cool idea. But from there, I struggled. 
 First, I just couldn't connect with the writing. I would literally find myself re-reading whole paragraphs because it would jump so quickly from one thing to the next. 
 And I did not understand any of the people. Delaney would get mad or suddenly be kissing someone and she just seemed so confused about it all. She never seemed to do any internal thinking or wondering...she never pondered why she struggled with feelings for Decker or what was going on with Troy. She just had very simple, direct thoughts that seemed very...I don't know, detached? 
 and because she felt detached and...robot-like maybe?... I didn't understand her actions or decisions at all. 
 Her questioning Justin at the party. Why was that in there? It seemed so random to me and it just made Delaney look mean. Which she seemed to do...a lot. She was mean at the library with Janna when she ignored her. She seemed to be mean to everyone. 
 And her mom....what an odd situation that whole thing was. I didn't understand her reaction or her emotions at all. 
 all in all, this was just a confusing book and I never found myself immersed in the world. The writing felt detached and a little...emotionless (for lack of a better word) and it just never sucked me in."
3,"One thing I really appreciate with this book is that it kicks start the story right away. It takes you into the Shade where the vampires live and the sun never rises. Sophie is kidnapped on her seventeenth birthday and taken to Derek Novak, the prince of the vamps, as a part of his harem. Derek, upon seeing Sophie is instantly attracted to Sophie and chooses her and her only, to be his slave. 
 In my eyes, she was most beautiful because at a time when she had every right to be terrified, she managed to show comfort to another person who needed it. 
 I first read the sample which left me intrigued and I just had to know what happened next. The plot draws you in with all the mystery and danger with the villain Lucas there and the whole prophecy thing. It really felt like a promising read but I had some problems connecting with the characters. Derek was too gentle for my tastes and in a different plot that would've been fine but he's the prince in this story. I was hoping for more toughness on his part. I'm also not really into the whole instant attraction Derek had for Sophie. It was too easy but apparently she'd his mate and I've come to accept that in the world of supernatural romance mates are mates. That's that. In the end its the suspense and the thrill of what's about to happen that's kept me hooked to this book. The plot will intrigue you and keep you wanting more."
5,"Ah. This book. Thank you Michelle Hodkin, thank you."
5,"It had to be Afghanistan... The end was going to be nice but then something terrible happens, and although it is a great cliff hanger, you wish the story had very nice happy ending, but sometimes life itself is like this story, it can't end with a happy ever after."
5,One of the rare times where I wish the Goodreads rating went past 5 stars.
4,"This is a very good serie, i've read all six books and all of them are very good quality. 
 Pros: 
 An intelligent storyline complicated and quite unpredictable(if at times using ghosts as Deus ex machina a little bit too often), good characters that if they are sometimes extreme, they are nonetheless believable. Everything is quite beliavable, dialogues and actions are quite realistic which is great. 
 Cons: 
 -The worldbuilding is a little bit poor and thin and the politics of it are sketchy at best, and considering most books have a lot of politics in it that is a major fault. (Rusland?! what stupid name is that?) 
 - Bad characters are not much bad. They're not scary enough. Also demons are used a little bit too much as an excuse to justify evilness. 
 - sometimes the holes between a book and the other are just too big and few phrases here and there are not enough to fill the emptiness of what happened"
5,"This was the surprise book of 2014, I finally read it and can see why it was buzz worthy. It's a really great story of being stranded on Mars, the author being a software engineer and science nerd definitely lent this tale an aura of reality. I might have hesitated reading this novel because I was afraid being centered around 1 character alone might be boring, as I found the case with the Tom Hanks movie, Cast Away. But that's not the case here! The main character Mark Watney is telling you the story through logs (audio clips / video records) as if he were passing down this story to you. He has a series of disasters to overcome, and the way in which he solves these problems is fascinating. I understood only a certain chunk of the science and I would love to see the Matt Damon movie to see how they explain things. The story also flips back and forth between characters on Earth and in space. I was completely engrossed in the story. 
 A great book to both read and listen, the audiobook narrator does a really fine job. The story got so thrilling I had to abandon him and read the last 25% on the Kindle. 
 Too bad this wasn't eligible for the 2015 Hugo Awards, it definitely is a science fiction novel with the emphasis on science, it could have been a contender."
3,"This book has been sitting on my virtual shelf even pre-GoodReads membership and I'm glad that even after all this time I have finally got around to reading this. 
 I thought initially that Book of a Thousand Days would be more of a light fairytale about friendship then the dark, more imaginative story that the book turned out to really be. I adored reading Dashti's perspective, she is such a grounded and kind female character that somehow despite her circumstances never got whiny or annoying with her narrative. 
 I'll admit that I had some minor problems with the first part of the book while Dashti lived imprisoned for the sole reason of Lady Saren. Equal to the amount I enjoyed Dashti, I disliked Saren. For someone in her situation she seemed rather ungrateful for Dashti being with her, even after two years of imprisonment which to me seems rather inhuman. As the book continues Saren's behaviour begins to make more sense but while I was reading I just did not share Dashti's sympathy for her. As a result of this reading about Sarens struggles were more irksome then interesting. I did however in the end come to like Sarens character and knowing the way the story plays out how Shannon Hale was writing her makes sense with the plot. 
 Book of a Thousand Days managed to weaved a rather fantastical story in a believable, intricate world with an adventure that could have gone in any direction. This wasn't something I expected from a story that after putting off for so long I had many expectation for. This is an excellent adventure-fantasy book and I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a fairy tale retold."
4,"This is not your typical ""lovey dovey"" romance; it is dark, gruesome, and twisted. ""Seven Sons"" is the first serial novella out of seven; Lili St. Germain has created a unique series that will leave you cringing in your chair at some of the events that take place during this book. I still haven't decided if the heroine is brave, or just plain stupid to put herself at risk like she did. One thing is for sure, its time for Julz to get even. 
 How far would you be willing to go for revenge? Well, Julz is willing to go far beyond what most would. She has very good reason though. When she was 15 years old, she was held down and raped by the President of the MC and his six sons. It was brutal and traumatizing;and came with some disastrous results. Not only was she harmed; but Dornan killed her father as well. 
 Six years later and Julz is ready to put her plan into place to get her revenge. The extremes that she goes to in order to do it is mind boggling. She is no longer Julz; but she now has a new identity and her name is Samantha. She goes through with her plan; but learns very quickly that she may have bit off more than she can chew. It is too late to get out though, and with Dornan obsessed with her it isn't going to be easy to carry this plan out. Samantha runs into some huge surprises along the way, but she is determined to see this through. She wants the father dead and all his evil sons..well...except the youngest one; Jase. She use to love him, and she quickly finds out that he still is able to make her have strong feelings for him. He is a major complication that she didn't anticipate. What will happen as she falls deeper and deeper in love with Jase? Will she still be able to carry out her plan to kill his brothers? Or will she just walk away? 
 This first installment of the serial series may have been short; but it is full of action,sex,violence, and even some romance. There was never a dull moment, and even though this is a very dark series I have enjoyed every minute of it so far. I can't wait to see what Julz will do, and what other surprises are in store for us readers! I am glad that I took a chance on this series, and author who I have never tried before. I now have yet another author to add to my auto buy list!!"
4,"I had extra time on my hands this lazy spring Sunday, thus I was able to read The Falconer all in one sitting. I enjoyed it. It is very reminiscent of the Faefever series but enjoyable in its own different way. 
 For starters, there was the steampunk aspect. I loved that Aileana was an engineer and had all these wonderful Fae killing gadgets: a sonic cannon, a dart pistol, explosives. She even has an ornithopter (which I still can't pronounce) likened to Leonardo Da Vinci's bat winged flying machine. I could very much picture this version of Edinburgh with elite flying machines and motorized carriages. It was a lovely place to be. 
 Except for all the murderous Fae. Here, they are imagined in all shapes and forms. There are flying dragon like creatures called sluagh, wolf like creatures: du sithe (don't quote me on that), troll like Fae called red caps, pixies, and a few others I can't pronounce or spell. There is a bestiary included at the end of the book with Aileana and Kiaran's notes on each type. Each had their own strengths and weaknesses and Aileana makes full use of her gadgets on them. 
 The beginning of the book is very fast paced. Aileana fights Fae after Fae, including one long battle in the middle where a couple types of Fae are chasing after her and she is mostly blind to them. Aileana's weakness against the Fae is an interesting one, in that she can't see them without the use of a special flower. If the necklace is removed, or if she is forced to use it as her only weapon, she can't see or hear them, and must sense them and their magic. It's odd to say this, but I hope we see more blind Fae battles in the next book, because that's when they got really interesting. 
 I enjoyed the characters for the most part. Aileana is a hero who is strong and broken and vulnerable all at once. Kiaran is her mysterious Fae trainer, but as he has so many secrets, and shows so little emotion, it was hard to get a real feel for him. Gavin is an old friend with an ability to see the Fae and he is a true gentleman. There is going to be an inevitable love triangle here, and I feel like I'm supposed to root for Kiaran, but in truth I felt Gavin was a better character. 
 Then there's Derrick. The honey drunk, foul mouthed, tailoring, mending, thief of a pixie. If I'm being honest, Derrick outshines them all. I absolutely loved and adored him and found myself smiling at everything he did. If this trilogy ever gets a spin off, I hope Derrick is the MC. 
 My biggest critique for the book seems to be the same critique I have for all YA fiction, it can be redundant at times. ""Kiaran is not human."" ""Kiaran keeps secrets."" ""Never trust a fae."" ""I'm a murdering liar."" There were an additional two lines that were repeated frequently that I think did actually work well here, ""Crimson suits you best,"" and ""Can you name the stars, Aileana?"" And the reason they worked was because they were more meaningful than being an 18 year old's inner boy crush monologue. They were being used to highlight the horror of that moment when Aileana's mother was murdered, and simultaneously to remind Aileana's of the memories and the love she shared with her mother. They also have a significant impact in the ""end"" of the book that I won't share because spoilers. 
 Overall I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to any fans of Fae fantasy. It also ended on a huge cliff hanger so I'll be on the lookout for the next two books!"
5,"A beautifully written, if not at times anxiety causing, book. Despite the beginning of the book that, quite literally, made me cringe, I fell in love with Simon Spier's story."
5,Perfect.
4,"I've watched the movie many times. Love the movie. I knew it was a book, I just had never really thought to pick it up until I saw it in a used bookstore and decided ""Why not?"" and bought it. I'm glad I did, though there were parts that made me sad and other parts I just down right hated. But there were other parts that made things out of the movie make much more sense. 
 Evelyn Couch seems like such a pathetic character, though her transformation is one I love. The book sheds more light on the way she is than the movie, in which I'm grateful. I think there are times when most people feel they have no where they belong too and can relate to that. Or to the husband who seems more interested in game after work than anything else. I can see how she has slowly lost herself over the years. It is sad to see, but I also love seeing how weekly visits with Mrs. Threadgoode have started to get her thinking differently. Not that she has to lose 25 pounds to be happy, but that she is perfect the way she is now and maybe just get some hormones for that pesky thing called menopause. I think her transformation from a meek woman into a self confident woman is beautiful. (view spoiler)[Though the part I hated, just hated, in the book was that she left and in those two months stopped all communication with Mrs. Threadgoode. She thought about her often but never picked up the phone or anything and so she missed out on two months with her friend who helped shape her into just loving herself. This is one of the few things I'm glad they left out of the movie.... but I might be biased since I watched the movie first. (hide spoiler)] 
 The timeline in here isn't chronological. It jumps around. Which makes it feel just as if Mrs. Threadgoode is just telling one of her many stories. I thought this would irritate me a bit but I liked it. It felt like storytime. I also loved The Weem Weekly. I loved the little bits of what was going on. I liked how while they shared stuff, they didn't seem to gossip. They lifted each other up and tended to not drag people down. We don't do that anymore. 
 Mostly the book offered more in depth character building that helped to make things clearer. In the movie Ninny isn't in any of the scenes that I recall. Though now I'm going to watch it to see. But I remember thinking is she really Idgie? How can we be sure that she isn't? And it seems I'm not the only one who wondered. But the book includes Ninny in many parts and it makes much more sense. And one of the things that made me wonder is that as far as we know, Idgie hasn't visited Mrs. Threadgoode in the nursing home. She talks of being the last one left. I always assumed this means left alive, but in the movie and book I suppose this means left in the area. 
 I think one of the story lines that made me the saddest was actually Smokey Lonesome. The poor guy. His life never seemed to get better. The bright spot in his life was the Cafe and after that closed down it seemed he had nothing left to look forward too. 
 I'm glad I took the time to read this book. I'm glad I saw it stacked just there on that table and picked it up."
5,"This book has caused me such pain. 
 My heart feels so broken."
3,"This book was just OK for me, mainly due to the slow pacing of the story. It was so long before much of anything happened and what finally did happen didn't seem worth the build up to it. I am told, however, that this is typical for Historical Fiction, so perhaps this genre is just not for me. Well, the slow pacing of it is typical, not necessarily the ultimate minor story development (IMO). 
 I was never able to get lost in this book, and didn't feel connected to the characters, particularly Diana. In fact, when other characters took center stage in a chapter here and there, the story picked up for me, and then resumed its drag when we returned to Diana. 
 In addition to not feeling a connection with the characters, this book suffers a bit from being in the middle of a trilogy. The author held back from tying up too much of the story, presumably to save it for book 3, but that left book 2 largely unsatisfying. At the same time, the story meandered, almost as if Harkness wanted to make the book ""long enough"". 
 I'm on the fence if I'll read book 3, and would only recommend Shadow of Night to people who really enjoy historical fiction."
4,"Funny, light, and true to life - a beautifully written MG romance."
5,"This was so fun, all the characters are amazing and I forgot how much fun a Riordan book could be. This mythology is fascinating and I can't wait to see more, I mean, a talking self-wielding sword, craft-offs, rune magic and shape shifting, sign me up. Their little family of empty cups warmed my heart. Hopefully, they'll be able to acquire the hammer of Thor and watch some Game of Thrones in the next one."
3,Die hard fans will dig most of these stories. Casual fans can flip through the families that interest them and take in the scenery. It's a gorgeous book worth paging through for the artwork alone. 3.5 stars.

 Extra book Details: Heroine & Hero POV; 1st person. Approx 400 pages. First in the series, each book is about a different sister. 
 'I've moved through life doing what's expected of me. I'm the dutiful daughter, I braved a vicious attack and survived. I devoted herself to her family's business empire. I met an ambitious man and fell in love. We were going to run Fleur Cosmetics together, Zachary and I. 
 Until he got a promotion and left me in the dust. Maybe it's for the best, between his disloyalty and his wandering eye. But another man was waiting for me. Wanting me. He too has an overwhelming thirst for success, just like Zachary--perhaps even more so. He's also ruthless. And mysterious. I know nothing about Ryder McKay beyond that he makes me feel things I've never felt before. 
 One stolen moment, a kiss, a touch . . . and I'm hooked. Ryder's like a powerful drug, and I'm an addict who doesn't want to be cured. He tells me his intentions aren't pure, and I believe him. For once, I don't care. I'm willing to risk everything just to be with him. Including my heart. My soul. 
 My everything.'

 I think as soon as the characters were introduced, I loathed them. 
 The hero and heroine's - almost - signifiant others; Zachary and Pilah - were obnoxious, manipulative and power driven. They featured heavily, and I could only feel pissed whenever they were in it. Pilah & Ryder's relationship reminded me a lot of was like the Christian and Elena from FsoG. 
 Violet allowed Zachary to cheat on her for the majority of their relationship. She actually expected him to stop philandering when they married. He eventually went too far, and did something in public to embarrass her. Only then did she dump him. 
 Ryder teamed up with Pilah, to split up Violet and Zachary to better their professional lives by manipulating them and having sex with them both. We were constantly told he was 'dark' but all I could see was that he was an asshole-alpha-dom. 
 Over time, they softened when they began to fall in love. Violet showed some backbone and Ryder proved that he could not be just an asshole just because he finally felt normal emotions. They showed more depth and a few likeable traits. But it wasn't enough, because underneath they were still mainly unlikeable. 
 I didn't like the story. Or the characters. The end was rushed and anti-climatic, the book felt too long. The characters motivations were unconvincing. There was a lot of sex, though it was good sex. The writing was great. But overall, I only enjoyed about 15% of it."
3,"Fun book! The last quarter wasn't all that great, but I enjoyed the portions about her growing up and eventually finding work at The Office. With a second memoir out about 5 years after publishing this one, I can't help but think maybe she should have waited a little longer and just had one book come out...that being said I'll be reading Why Not Me?. Here's hoping there's more Office talk, I hear there's some BJ Novak gossip that will likely be worth it alone! ;)"
4,"It was so good that I opened my laptop which was 6% right away to get the second book. Holy goddamn shit. 
 Nina/Matthias & Jesper/Wylan : OTPs. 
 Kaz and Inej : Best BrOTP in my opinion."
3,"3.5 
 The second book I read by Kurt Vonnegut, and while I find his style interesting, I can't say it's my favorite. Much like the first, I wasn't emotionally connected to the characters, and while he poses interesting philosophical questions, they were repetitive of those from his other novel (Slaughterhouse Five). This guy must find life completely pointless."
5,"Jane, fell in love with Hugh, but who broke her heart when he just abandoned her with no goodbye. Now many years later he has reentered her life once more, insisting that because she is in danger she must marry him with her father right behind him on it....so with not much choice she agrees. Hugh, even though it killed him inside when he had to leave her, he knew it was better that way because of the curse against his family. Now however because of a past friend going against everything he once believed in wants to kill Jane to get back to Hugh and her father, and Hugh still loves her with a desperated and will do everything he can to protect her...even though it may cost him his sanity and his heart...If You Desire is the second in the MacCarrick trilogy, and by far my favorite of the series. When I first started reading this book, I kept hoping that it would be as good as I had heard about, but after read the first in the series and being disappointed I didn't want to get my hopes too high. However, I think I just fell in lust/love with If You Desire. I would have to say the best of the series!!! I loved the story of this series...where you have two people who have fallen in love with each other before but both ended up hurt, but find themselves in close proximity to each other again and this time the love they share is only magnified. There were so hilarious moments in this book...that had me unseated with laughter. The sensuality side of this story, was sexy and hott but not too much that turned me off...it was just perfect in my estimation. There was such delicious material in this book that it will leave you only earning for more!! A Tantalizing Read!!!!"
5,"The main problem with this book was I couldn't put it down. I should have been doing a heap of other stuff, but instead I was drawn into this story about two broken men. Emotions. Hot sex. Good secondary characters. Some little twists. A great GFY story."
4,"The idea of this book is already motivating and tickling me to read it. 3 stars for the concept! 
 I just started to read this book Yesterday and to my suprise..I was yeah.. really suprised. I thought that it was a story. A normally written/told story. However, it's reminding me of a poetry or a diary! Well that's very exiting to read. Each chapter is so short but it attracts you to read more and more by every turn of a page.. 
 within a half hour I managed to read 73 pages.. fantastic story. I want to know more and can't wait to figure out what the relationship between Ava and Jackson is.. and of course why he actually died! 
 More suprises to come from now on. 
 - 
 So I am back and wow I reached beyond my expectations! Just finished it and i have to tell you that this story has a interesting mix. 
 From sweet: boyfriend died because ava dared him to do something dangerous. However, he doesn't leave ava Rather stay with her till the end. STOP --- you will probably think ""how sweet"" or something like ""well thst is called true love""..but when Ava realise that being haunted by her own boyfriend was not the perfect way to live on.. Thinks starts to get creepy.. 
 That leads to the creepy ghost part. Ava tries to get along with her friends and realise that having Jackson around her she just can't move on... When she meets Lyric things becomes more complicated... Go for de alive boy or the dead. She then decides to avoid Jackson which actually was a bad idea because he was yeah.. haunting her..down? When the story starts to getting scarier it suddenly made a light twist.. From creepy ghost boyfriend to lovely Jackson who just wanted to help her return to her normal life.. 
 That was sweet. I actually wanted to cry when he finally said that he would leave and just wanted to take a way her guilt with him so she would be able to live in joy.. That's just amazing.. 
 So.. Completing this review for now. 
 I loved this book. It was an easy read and a quick page turner.. Nice work! 
 However, it made me sad when I realised I've read the final page and Ava dicovered her pure personality."
4,"Reading from my ARC only almost a year after I got it. I always feel a bit weird about that but what can I say I'm poor and I plan to give the authors business in the future. 
 Keri plans for everything. She had a plan the first time she broke her arm. Except she never planned for her brother's suicide, but what if it wasn't a suicide? Janna and Sione's older brothers supposedly killed themselves and they aren't the only ones, there is a pattern too obvious to ignore. Is there a serial killer targeting young men who spend New Years in Summerton? 
 I really enjoyed this, the post is just so late because I'm lazy. Healey is good at making a cast diverse without resorting to ""I will make a character of each color"" or ""I will make this character Different and spend forever explaining how this makes them feel."" It is not about their diversity but rather here are these teens, you sympathize with them, you realize they have a secret or just something special about them but it doesn't change who they are. Like much YA the parents take a back seat but they are not completely absent. You get an idea of how they are affected and how they feel. These protagonists are not orphans, Janna has younger siblings, and their families have already lost someone and it raises the stakes. 
 I don't want to give spoilers but the Library of Congress subject headings listed in the final version of the book do include Supernatural - Fiction, so it's not a spoiler as long as I don't go to far. There is magic. It is subtle and even knowing it would be there it almost surprised me. It is hard to pin down. There is the point that not all magic is equal. People see it differently, use it differently, invoke different spirits. Some believe there is dark and light but where do you draw the line, or is it all the same in the end? (Really though I have an MLIS and I spend a decent amount of time chuckling at the often times terribly skewed summaries and subject headings.) Once again, Healey (or her editor or whoever) gets a title bravo for the intriguing, not too confusing, oh I get it at the end! Also Healey is really good and making me unsure of who to trust."
2,"I love Sydrian, but this book.....it really felt like Mead was burnt out on their story. It was short, and sometimes felt rushed. Rather than living with some of the actions that were going on we were rushed through them, glossed over. While it was resolved, and neat and tidy and a nice shiny red bow, I wished for more. 
 I felt the premise of the story, to find Jill while dealing with married life was going to be a good story, instead I got a boring plot. And I don't mean that it was bad, I just mean the excitement factor was lacking. There were some exciting parts, and some amusing parts, but for the most part it lacked that excitement we found in the earlier books and I can't tell if it's just because where we are at in the story, or if it is because Mead got burnt out and couldn't think up more. Things went too easily in this one. They run into familiar people but nothing comes of that, they evade Alchemists and nothing comes of that, they have some small battles but again all seemed and appeared relatively easy. Everything was cut and dry. It felt too easy. I expected more twists and turns, gut wrenching emotions and I only got a tiny amount of that. 
 The book was utterly short, this could have been added to the last book, granted where the last book ended was good, but for this one to only basically have 20 chapters really sucked for me. I was also able to predict some parts of the storyline regarding the subplot. I had some theories for that, and it's interesting how it came about it was pretty much what I predicted albeit only slightly different. 
 The end of chapter 19 was great, and emotional, I thought it really showed us the love through all of the characters, but towards the end I actually wanted to hear Sydrian fill in the gang on the big secret, I wanted to know their reactions and I found myself disappointed to hear about it. 
 The epilogue was great, it's a year later and gets everyone together and helps us know what's going on with Sydrian, but where it ended, it was nice, but I just found myself wanting more. I'm not exactly unhappy with it, but I just don't know exactly. There was something missing. Well that and the fact the series ends with Adrian's POV and we don't get to close out on how Sydney is feeling, granted I'm sure we know, but I find it odd since the series started out with just Sydney. Seemed logical for it to tie together with her again. 
 Overall I am disappointed by this book, I just felt it was lacking in some areas. I just didn't feel blown away as I had in past books."
4,"But...but...but....why do I have to wait for more story?! 
 This was excellent. I love the themes of this story and I love the characters already. I can't wait for more."
3,Totally predictable but I still enjoyed it.
5,"Burn by Callie Hart is the third book in her Blood & Roses series. A dark and twisty book full of tension and desire. 
 While I wanted to hear more about Lacey, the story really couldn't have gone there. Picking right back up inside the compound where Sloane and Zeth are biding their time, waiting for Sloane's sister to appear, we now encounter the previously mentioned motorcycle club and their villainous leader. More on that topic would be way too many spoilers though. 
 A compelling and absorbing story for any fan of dark romance - Callie Hart has created some amazing characters and my only wish is that she would write faster and ease the ache of WAITING (sigh). 
 I highly recommend this series."
2,"I just didnt get it. 
 I really wanted to like it, it got so many good reviews, but the story was confusing and even though it was supposed to be, I didnt get any of the hidden meanings and I have a lot of questions unanswered. What exactly are the Hemstock? Where did the creatures come from? What? How? huh? 
 Of course, it was beautifully read by Gaiman but slower than I would have read it myself. I'll try his other works before I make up my mind."
5,"I just don't think I'll ever get over how exceedingly creepy it was to have the same (unusual) name as a super creepy doll in a creepy book. 
 Really, though, this book was fantastic. Honestly one of the best books I've read in a really long time. The stories and imagination were amazing and done perfectly and these kids were absolutely 100% real. Holly Black truly and deeply understands and respects kids and this book reflects that. 
 Also, how could I not love a story in (part of) Ohio, with (view spoiler)[sailing adventures (hide spoiler)] (for serious - this was perfect) and (view spoiler)[library adventures (this was also perfect - the librarian was so very spot on wonderful and I loved every second of her) (hide spoiler)]? Everything I wanted and so so very much more."
5,"The perfect blend of amazing plot, believable characters, enchanting world, and amazingly good writing. Laini Taylor is a true artist! More detailed review on my tumblr..."
3,"""All life amazes me"" says Lucy the narrator of the book and she reflects on various aspects of her life. Aside from this, nothing much happens in the book. It's very introspective and told in such a monotonous way with no emotion. ""This must be the way most of us maneuver through the world half knowing, half not, visited by memories that can't possibly be true.""((14) I think life amazes her more in a confusing way -- clearly she is working out some things in her reflections, namely an impoverished childhood lived in a garage with neglectful (at best) parents and a brother and sister -- reminded me of the Glass Castle, though this is fiction. ""I kept thinking how the five of us had had a really unhealthy family, but I saw then too how our roots were twisted so tenaciously around one another's hearts."" (168) Lucy becomes a writer to face some of this, ruthlessly as she is advised, but there is not much revealed about her writing or other facets of her life, other than the length of time she spends in the hospital with a mysterious illness and how her mother comes to visit which is what gets this reflection in motion. I wondered at points whether any of it was really happening or if it was all in her head."
5,"** spoiler alert ** 
 I really like this book :) 
 The only thing is its so much like The Iron Fey series that I'm going to be confused when the next Iron Fey book comes out.. lol 
 I'm glad they seem to have a solution to the love triangle that was there but I don't think its going to last. I think Keenan and Aislinn will get closer over time and Seth and Donia will start to bond because they seemed to look out for each other when Beira attacked them. Also, Donia kinda seemed to like him and Seth said she was hot...not much to go on but its just a hunch. :) 
 Anyways, I ordered the next two so I'm waiting patiently for them to get here :)"
4,"To my own surprise, I really really enjoyed this. It was cute, fun and it took my mind off of things when I was piled up with... well things and things to do (and barely got to finish it in 8-days time because of things). Better review to come when I'm more rested and when I'm not feeling like my brain is going to burst any minute."
4,"Back into the world of Harry Dresden through another excellent audio book presentation. Between Fool Moon and Scarlet by Marissa Meyer, I've been reading about werewolves a lot. Not that I'm complaining. 
 The interesting premise of this book is that there are multiple ways to become a werewolf and it explores the problems associated with each. I enjoyed the juxtaposition and creativity the author showed in developing the different types. I always assumed a werewolf was just an unfortunate who received a nasty bite. Silly me. 
 (view spoiler)[My favorite part was the dream when Harry's subconscious came out of the shadows to talk to himself. I wish that my own dreams were that straight forward. They're usually so cloaked in symbolism as to be nonsensical. (hide spoiler)] 
 Harry is still snarky and dour and I loved this. On to the next book!"
3,"***FINAL RATING: 3.10 STARS*** 
 CATCHALL 
 Between the Lines is dressed to impress. With an intriguing cover and a fairytale-type plot, it's sure to draw in a crowd. Add gorgeous, vivid illustrations and colorful, playful font and you've amped it up even more. Not only that, but it was written by the writing goddess Jodi Picoult and her daughter, making it a seemingly unforgettable and unique YA book. I admit that the only Jodi Picoult book I've read so far is My Sister's Keeper, but that book made me bawl my eyes out and I will not soon forget it. I loved Between the Lines, but it lacks some things that I can't overlook. Despite having everything right and perfect on the outside, it has some internal flaws that kept it from gaining a higher rating. 
 THE HERO 
 OLIVER 
 Oliver is a prince. And he's clever. He knows that a world exists outside of the pages he lives in, even though it seems that rarely does anyone believe him. He's pretty great, but he lacks something, you know? Outwardly, there's nothing wrong with him. A handsome prince with serious brains. But he can be...selfish. And I don't appreciate that. There's one particular thing he does where he doesn't think about Delilah at all and only of what he wants an what will benefit him and make him happy. That's just seriously wrong. He did have good intentions, but he should have thought before he did what he did. A bit too impulsive, but he does have a good heart. Also, I don't find the name Oliver particularly hot or anything because it reminds me of Oliver Twist which reminds me of the worst ten hours of my life. I'm rambling now, so, let's move on. 
 THE HEROINE 
 DELILAH 
 Actually, I'm not hugely a fan of the name Delilah either. I don't hate it, but it doesn't make the list of top one hundred names ever either. Even so, Delilah was a seriously awesome heroine. She can be sweet, but she seriously has an attitude. And I love that about her. She doesn't just go along with everything Oliver wants. She wants the best for him, but she needs things to fit into her life, too. And I think that that's reasonable. She's extremely strong, and it's impossible not to admire that. I would totally read another book just because I adore her and I bet that she'll go on to do great things in life, you know? 
 THE SON 
 ETHAN 
 Ethan does not show up much, but I like him. In fact, he only really shows up near the end, but I love him. Um. He's somewhat of a loner. Oliver's opposite. But then in the end, they're not so different as it seems. And Ethan's obviously smart too, and he has a plan to give everyone a happily ever after. 
 THE PLOT 
 The idea for this book came from Samantha, and clearly she has an awesome imagination. I wish I had that kind of imagination, seriously. I've never read anything vaguely like Between the Lines, at least nothing that I can think of. So this book scores some points just for that. Because so many YA books these days feel exactly the same. Between the Lines is like a glass of water. 
 (Quick random observation that really has nothing to do with the plot: I do think this book tries a bit too hard to ride on the popularity of Jodi Picoult. Her name takes up like half the freaking spine of the book and then there's Samantha's name, a bit smaller, and then it says Between the Lines in like really small lettering. Like, what is up with that?) 
 That aside, I did love the plot of this book. It had some plot holes that are too spoilery to mention, so obviously I won't mention them. But the point is that they exist, and I can't overlook that. And then some plot lines just...drop. Like they are there one moment and they're never really resolved. I don't know if they were meant to be left open-ended or what, but...it just seemed like poor execution to me. 
 I do like the way Delilah goes about trying to get Oliver out of the book. She's smart about it. She does what she thinks might work and when it doesn't, she tries to decide what to do next. But at the same time, I think she lets it take over her life a bit too much. She becomes obsessed with it. Too obsessed with it. Everyone has obsessions, but generally they are not ones that could get you declared insane or sentenced to an asylum, you know? 
 Ah, but I get ahead of myself. Before Delilah becomes overly obsessed, she lives a very normal life. She's every teenage girl. Shy. Only one really close friend. Loves to read, one story in particular. I love how something that seems so ordinary can turn into something so very extraordinary. She wants something, and in a very twisted way, she gets her wish. 
 Loved the originality. While there were unoverlookable faults, this book real made up for a lot of them. I consider this book easily a favorite. 
 THE ROMANCE 
 Delilah is already half in love with Oliver when she meets him for the first time, and as the story progresses we can see them beginning to fall even more for each other. It builds slowly. And while Oliver might be a bit behind on the times, Delilah has a sensible head on her shoulders and doesn't want to rush things. She wants to enjoy things, and she also doesn't want it to move too fast. That's something that's extremely refreshing to see because it's not very common in the YA genre. Oliver and Delilah's sparks fly across the page, even through the page. (See what I did there?) 
 THE WRITING 
 The story rotates. First there is a part of the fairytale story being told, the story that is the book Delilah loves. Then there's the POV of Oliver, and then Delilah. And it rotates like this through the entire story. I absolutely love that the story is told this way. You get the swoony fairytale, and you can see why Oliver wants so desperately to escape and why Delilah loves it so much. Then you can get into Oliver's head and also Delilah's, and this rotating POV just thrilled me. I was worried it would be difficult to keep up, but I was wrong. I always knew exactly what was going on and the dual (triple?) POV thing was the perfect way to tell this story. And Jodi and Samantha together have created unique voices for their characters, and if they work together to write a book again I'll be the first in line to buy it. 
 THE ILLUSTRATIONS 
 Let's all take a minute to appreciate the color illustrations, shall we? (I did plan to put a picture on here, but then I got too lazy, so yeah. Maybe I'll add one sometime soonish.) And even more than that, there are some sweet black silhouette illustrations that show up randomly and are still beautiful. And they just add so much to the book. They somehow make it more real. I'm not sure who the illustrator is, but I seriously admire him/her. They just embrace the story so beautifully and the level of detail is awesome. 
 THE ENDING 
 I love happily-ever-afters. Have since I was old enough to know what one was. And this HEA...well, it made me absolutely tingle. Not only was it so sweet I thought I would melt, but it was absolutely the perfect ending. I wondered how it would happen, but Jodi and Samantha gave this book the perfect ending without making anything too convenient or too easy. That's easily one of the best things about this book and maybe even what I loved the most. I mean, there was that part of me that thought things wrapped up too nicely, but whatever. 
 WRAPUP 
 I really loved Between the Lines, but it wasn't a perfect book. Although I loved the writing, it wasn't stellar and could have used work. The plot was original but oversimplified in some points. Although I spend the good part of this review gushing, I need to mention that this book does have problems. It's a very fairytale type book. It's a ton of fun, but lacks a little substance in some places. Between the Lines is a fun, quick read for all ages, though, and I would absolutely recommend it. Because it goes to show that there isn't always a damsel in distress. Sometimes, it's the prince needs saving. 
 FINE. 
 Find more of my reviews on Sparkles and Lightning!"
3,"I enjoyed this book! It took some adjusting to get used to the structure of letters as chapters, but I did really enjoy all the machinations, scheming, sarcasm, and insults."
5,"PERFECT! just perfect! 
 I would love to read this over and over and over again. 
 This makes me want to live my life and make mistakes. Let go and do what I love. It is so inspirimg."
4,"so my friend told me to read the prequel before starting throne of glass so i had to go and buy this. 
 i've heard good things about this series and after finishing the graceling trilogy last year and daughter of smoke and bone this year i was excited to start a new fantasy series with a badass heroine. 
 and then my friend (you yes you lisa) said that Celaena loves books AND clothes and i was like YES I NEED TO READ THIS. 
 so anyways this is the PREQUEL and is 5 novellas. so it gives you a background into the life of Celaena Sardothien and..you meet Sam and find out why she is the most feared person in Adarlan. 
 okay so Celaena is exceptionally beautiful AND SHE KNOWS IT. she is a trained assassin...she kills people for a living. 
 she is also only 16. but then she turns 17 in the red desert. 
 and i think in throne of glass she is 18. 
 so yeah she loves reading books, attending parties, shopping, eating delicious food and of course fighting... 
 she is so cool. she is a likeable character full of sarcastic wit, a sharp tongue, beauty, grace and just she is such a bamf. like i just love her so much. 
 and no she doesn't have many friends. 
 she is pretty lonely. 
 and vain and selfish 
 at times. 
 but she grows and learns from her mistakes except she needs to not be so damn trusting. 
 especially since she never acknowledges the horror that is Arobynn...i understand why she feels tied to him but still. 
 AND THEN THE ENDING OH MY GLOB WHY WHY WHY WHY. 
 OKAY BEFORE THAT THAT. 
 the first novella is about pirates and is really cool coz she and sam do a really cool and reckless yet brave and heroic thing. 
 but they will obv pay for it... 
 in the 2nd one she meets this awesome healer and you find out about the magic and how it has disappeared and yeah it sucks 
 then in the 3rd one SHE MEETS ILLIAS who i love with the green eyes and ansel oh man and the horses and the silent assassins are so cool. i hope to see illias again ;) 
 in the 4th one...the 4th one is the worst one because bad things happen...BAD THINGS HAPPEN AND NO IT IS NOT OKAY I AM WARNING YOU BE PREPARED FOR THE WORST. 
 it was so sudden. 
 and she just had to move on and get on with her life. 
 like no 
 betrayal upon betrayal. poor celaena. =( 
 SAM IS EVERYTHING OKAY HE LOVES HER AND WANTS TO SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE WITH HER AND SHE SAID SHE'S HAVE PICKED HIM AND THEY HAD SO MUCH LEFT TO TELL EACH OTHER LIKE SHE HAD TO TELL HIM ALL HER SECRETS. 
 AND THEN THE LAST ONE...she ends up going somewhere no one ever wants to go to and it feels like she will never escape. her punishment. and she accepts it. 
 but she carries the pain with her. 
 and she is Celaena Sardothien...she will NOT be afraid. 
 THEN YOU CRY AND READ THRONE OF GLASS 
 but sam. i will never forget your beautiful face. 
 p.s yes i want to be Celaena but not really she is really cool but i wouldn't want to be an assassin...coz you don't REALLY have a choice in who you kill...you either kill them or die or don't get your money or punished or whatever. so yeah. but i would defo be her friend coz she is just amazing."
5,"Awesome book!!! Can't wait for the next!! 
 For the first part of the book I was about to start making a list of pro's and con's about each guy! Then I was like "" It's Cash, he's the only one you should want! And then the twist. 
 LIKE I SAID AWESOME BOOK!!"
5,"You guys, this book made me laugh, cry then laugh again. 
 It was just beautiful and reminded me of why I loved the More Than series so much, Lucas has grown up to be such an adorable man. 
 I'm writing this with tears in my eyes and I'm not even in a hormonal period rn"
5,"I have read a lot of books in the YA-Fantasy genre and I have met, in my readings, countless protagonists. Some of them memorable and others, not so much. I can sincerely say that until this point, until Bleeding Violet, I hadn't met anyone as unconventional and as interesting as Hanna. She transcends stereotypes and expectations of what heroines should be and is not afraid to be her own individual self. Many people will have trouble with her character because in Hanna's world, morality is gray (or perhaps, more appropriately, purple) and she does what she wants to, damn the consequences. Dia Reeves takes us on a wild purple ride in Bleeding Violet. She takes all the set down, trusted and oft-traveled paths in fantasy storytelling and turns them upside down. The dialogue is biting and crisp and the plot has more twists and turns than Lombard Street. I was aware that I was reading from the viewpoint of someone who is not actually sane in the expected sense of the word but Reeves does not use insanity as a viable excuse for Hanna's individuality. In fact, she makes no excuses for it and is entirely unashamed of it. Reeves shows us Hanna through her skewed logic and at the same time, inserts a raw vulnerability in her by revealing her longing for a mother. Her mother. And when this desire for a response to her need of maternal love and acceptance leads her down a road she would not (perhaps) otherwise travel, my heart twinges. Because who can't remember doing stupid things just because you want to be accepted, because you want approval? 
 I hope that this is the first of the series because, whether people agree with me or not, Hanna is a far more interesting, far more vibrant heroine that Bella can ever hope to be. 
 So for the originality, both in characterization and plot, and the sheer insanity of it all, I give it five stars."
3,"Not good, and not bad. I liked the overall aspect of the story, what with the historical essence and the fact that Ismae was a badass heroine, but the over-dramatic story-telling sort of got on my nerves, and it never seemed to end. I also didn't really like the male character in the book, so it didn't appeal to me as much. However, I did like certain parts of it, especially how Ismae was a very strong protagonist on her own and that it had a good ending."
4,"Simple, quick, adorable, and totally predictable. It made me smile. 
 If it had been a longer reading investment I would have been less happy about guessing the entire plot before I even started. As it was, I liked the comforting few-hour diversion."
4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 I really liked the other Kristan Higgins book, but this one was a little flat. Maybe it's because I don't like doormats. I mean, I can tolerate doormatting up to a point. But the heroine in this book does all the giving, bending over, and even the begging near the end. 
 Okay. What did I like? The writing, as usual, is very good and the minor characters and subplots are entertaining. This book is more of a family drama than a straight romance. It includes a cast of quirky characters centered around a German restaurant called ""Guten Tag"" where they chant ""zicke, zacke, zicke, zacke, hoi, hoi, hoi."" 
 The heroine, Posey, is typical small-town dorky. She goes around saying ""bieber, bieber"" and ""holy Elvis Presley"" all day long, has a giant dog, and a couple of lazy cats and has a crush on the town bad boy who specialized in overlooking her, even while bedding the vast majority of the female population at one time or another. 
 Liam Murphy has been overlooking Posey all her life, even while he worked at her parents' restaurant. Now, years later and a widower, he has moved back to town so his only daughter can be closer to her grandparents. The first thing he does is ignore Posey as beneath his notice. 
 A typical stuck-in-the-elevator stunt leads the two to interact, at which point, Liam notices that maybe Posey's lips aren't too bad at all. He starts an affair with her under the condition she keep it secret and they don't display affection in public. 
 Posey never did grow a backbone, even after he predictably dumps her. She goes back on her hands and knees and makes a speech, declaring her true love and faith in him and all he says is, ""I'm sorry, Posey. I really am."" I've never met a more heartless hero. But since this is a romance, the writer has to engineer a get together at the end. 
 The change of heart was not well motivated. It was like, we knew the book had to finish, so somehow Liam is going to have a personality transplant and right all wrongs. But the stunt he did to get her back was more egotistical than sweet. Of course it worked on Pathethic Posey. But listen to his final words: ""Let's face it, you've been in love with me half your life, more maybe, and of course, I am incredibly good-looking and---"" 
 That said, I'm going back to the library to find another Kristan Higgins romance. I absolutely love the subplots."
5,"BELIEVE THE HYPE. 
 I'm serious, guys. I was so nervous to read this book because some friends I think highly of keep falling in love with Trade Me, which only terrifies me. But HOLY AWESOMENESS. 
 Let me warn you of two things first: 
 1. This book is written in (alternating) first person. 
 2. This book is written in present tense. 
 I KNOW. I KNOW! I was immediately tensed and ready to bolt, because those two things are usually deal breakers for me. But by chapter two, I was sucked right in, no turning back. It's just *that* good. 
 I was completely and utterly blown away by Trade Me. If real life hadn't interrupted, I would have read it all in one sitting. Between the writing itself, and the characters of Blake and Tina, I was in love. And TINA. Whoa. She's a heroine I can worship. She's brilliant, witty, and deep. So is Blake. There were so many aspects of their personalities that I found so refreshing and wonderful to read. 
 It also addresses some real world problems that are SO IMPORTANT. This isn't an ""issue book"", but the characters all experience real life issues. As far as I can tell, everything was handled beautifully, too. Courtney Milan has my utmost respect. 
 I highly recommend this book, especially if you usually turn your nose up at the new adult genre. This really was fantastic. 
 (Also, I'm really, really, really excited for the next book, which features a trans heroine. YES PLEASE! 
 I received this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review"
3,"Ok - the movie is one of my favourite in the world - I promise you. I can watch it twice in a row. Once in English then Japanese. I have a super huge crush on Howl special FREAKING Christian Bale being his English dub. 
 Anyways...so I think that's why my expectation for this book was so so so so high. Other than that - I liked the ending...I like Howl and Sophie. It was just hard in other parts that's all. 
 I definitely enjoyed the magic-ness of this book. 
 What to expect of the next one? Would it even have Howl at all??"
4,"Sometimes it's best to come into a book cold. That way you can be shocked, surprised, or fascinated by the author's decisions. When I started reading The Book Thief, I didn't know who the narrator was; I didn't know the setting, or the plot. Coming to learn these things as I read the book made it a much more interesting read. I won't spoil any of these things, but will heartily recommend the book with 4/5 stars. The narration of the book really draws the reader in, and I couldn't help but fall in love with the characters."
0,"I have done this several times on my blog. Books that just don't work for me. I know my reading style pretty well, and I can tell whether I will like the book or not accurately about 80-90% of the time. If I finish a book, then there are aspects of that book that I enjoyed. I never talk about the author in a negative way, I only say what doesn't work for me. Normally if I finish a book, I give it at least 3 stars, meaning that I liked it. 
 Stopped at 12% 
 I like simple scifi... and this one threw too many terms at me all at once and it was hard to deal with that and figure out what was going on. I need to connect with the main character quickly and although I knew that asa loved her sister and / was trying to do the best for the people, I was thrown into the middle of a crisis. 
 I thought that this would work for me because of the synopsis claim that it was an epic romance, but at 12% I still haven't seen a hint of the romantic interest. 
 That isn't to say that the writing is poor or the characters are poorly constructed, it's personal on my end.

3,"I won this through Firstreads, and read it immediately upon receiving it. I already think this series is going to be better than the Bridgerton series, which was pretty hit or miss for me, and all of the characters blended together. Ms. Quinn has really gotten better at writing, each book is more finely crafted than the last. The heroines in this series are all different, and honestly it's been a while since I could tell any romance heroines apart at all. The probable next heroine, Louisa, is very different from the previous three as well. (My bet is for her and Edward.) There are ties between this one and the previous, but not so many that I think it requires a reread before this one. I wish there were more ties to the first, but I guess it did come out quite a while ago. 
 Ms. Quinn's sex scenes are still not to my taste, they are an afterthought and set aside in a chapter, to be easily excised (whether that is a good thing or not, I leave up to you). I'm not sure what would have moved this up to four stars from three, but it is a high three, not a noncommittal three like many of my romance ratings are. I sincerely hope that Ms. Quinn follows her trend of sweet beta heroes who are secure in their masculinity but listen to the women when they speak and are willing to consider love and honor etc. The couple verbally spars, but only in flirting, and at the first sense of something serious, Sebastian makes it clear that the teasing is not serious, he is on her side. Some small mis-communications and obstacles are treated rationally and reasonably with quick apologies."
5,"Immortal Life is a fantastic book about the HeLa cell line - immortal cells that kick started many fields of modern medical science. 
 But the story goes beyond the clinical, exploring the life of Henrietta herself, her husband, her children, her many descendants. Much of the story focuses on Deborah, Henrietta's youngest daughter, and her search to learn about the mother she couldn't remember. 
 It's a heartbreakingly human tale of horrific medical abuse, crushing poverty, child abuse, Old Timey medical research ethics. It personalizes what have for so long been thought of as nothing more than a collection of cells in a test tube. 
 The issues raised about ethical medical research are important ones, and Skloot gives us few easy answers. But they are things that we all should know about and consider. 
 Even more important is the history of medical abuses towards black patients and those with mental illnesses. So much of the modern medical science we depend on today was developed through horrific experimentation on vulnerable populations. For that alone, this book should be required reading for all teens. 
 I was aware of most of the issues brought up in the book, but getting to know Deborah and the Lacks family made it all so much more viscerally real."
0,This book was too sweet! Such fluff and steam :D With just the right amount of angst to keep me going..
5,"I read this after Queen of Shadows and I'm now realising that I understand things that have happened in the past 4 books so much better now. I'm so glad I finally read this. I admit the reason I didn't want to was because I knew the outcome and knew my heart would break when I got to know Sam when I knew what his fate was but I'm so glad I did. 
 Also...fuck Arobynn Hamel."
4,"It has been such a long time since I read and finished a book. I started this one last night and I just flew through it. I didn't remember much from The Iron Trial since I read it a while ago, so it was a little hard at first to get my bearings and figure out what had happened in the first book to connect to this one, but once I got started, it became easier to remember. The story was quick-paced and engrossing; one thing I am a little disappointed with though is just how fast paced it is. We don't even go through an entire month (I think) of Call & co.'s second year at the Magisterium. It all happened really fast and just feels a little incomplete for me, as well as a little weird because the next book will start with their next year and there's a a large gap of time that didn't get covered because it was uneventful and doesn't contribute to the overall story line. Maybe it's because a majority of books that I read where they are in a school setting go through the entire year... 
 On another note, I often felt for a majority of the book a sort of disconnection with the characters. Maybe it's because Call feels so distant from the others that it just seemed like I don't know everyone as well as I think I do. I do think that the next book will be very interesting in exploring the relationships and dynamics between Call, Aaron, Tamara, Jasper, and Celia. With Aaron, I think we may get to see a darker side to him that had become more prevalent in this second book, and I think Call's new abilities may have some sort of strain on their friendship. It also seems like Call might be feeling something for Tamara, though I don't know if that's just friendship or something more that's going to happen. And then there's the whole thing with Celia...maybe I'm reading too much into it, but I wouldn't be surprised if she had ulterior motives or was a spy or something. 
 I'm excited to see where this series is heading, and I can't wait for the next book. I hope it's a little longer and that it'll take more to go through the motions of what happens to get to the next step."
3,"Graphic novel with an interesting take on the fantasy superhero genre. Every 90 years 12 gods come back. They live for 2 years and then die. In January 2014, the gods are reborn as teen pop idols and the story of The Wicked + The Divine begins. The entry character for readers is Laura, a mixed-race teen living in London, who worships the gods. The story begins at a concert for Amaterasu (who looks a lot like Florence Welch); Laura soon meets Luci (a female Lucifer who looks like the rock star Pink) and becomes drawn into the world of the gods. The pantheon of the gods includes many non-Western ones with whom I was unfamiliar. The story (this novel collects the first 5 comics) is intriguing and off to a compelling start. The art is gorgeous and vibrant. The profanity, violence, and sexuality make this a graphic novel for adults and older teens (16 and up). I liked the diversity of the characters both racially and sexuality and look forward to future volumes."
4,"Cute story. Reminds me a bit of Josh Lanyon's Adrian English series but with more humor. I adore Jory but Sam is an arse just like Jake. In fact, I like Jake better because he wasn't a tease with Adrian."
5,Awesome! Just devoured this and I can't wait for the sequel next month!
5,Liam and Amber they are so cute I loved how Liam is so protective and gorgeous it's just makes me wonder why such good guys exist only in books and that father I mean I could say he have issues because of hurting his children but how dare he rape his daughter and even tears later and he is not ashamed of what he had done I can't accept that or even could think of it
3,"The Red Pony 
 by John Steinbeck is a great coming of age story set in the Depression era on a California ranch. The book consists of four separate short stories, focusing on the life of Jody, a ten year old boy. His mother, father, and Billy Buck (the experienced ranch hand) are also key characters. Life on the farm is tough and the family and how they live is quite structured and disciplined. Discipline over emotion. 
 In these four stories, Jody learns hope, joy, disappointment, and sadness through various events that focus on the harsh reality of life on a farm during the Depression period. Only the first of the stories is around ""the red pony"", but all four are worthwhile on their own. Together, they weave a vivid picture of how Jody's emotional maturity evolves. 
 As this story is set on a farm, the content may be seen as harsh - specifically, around the treatment of animals and their mortality. A couple of scenes are rather graphic - real and appropriate for the setting, but could be disturbing or resonate with some. As a vegan animal lover, I cringed my way through them, and found that they added realism to the book. 
 My favorite quote from the book, as it offered a bit of relief from some of the cruelty and sadness: 
 ""No matter how good a man is, there's always some horse can pitch him."" 
 I would highly recommend this book to readers who like the classics, as it is a great story. I would also recommend this to people who are starting to explore the classic genre because it is a 95 page story that is easy to read."
5,Really love this story!
4,"EDITED: 3.5-4 
 I honestly wasn't sure how I was going to feel about this book. I've never read anything with sports being such a heavy influence. Any book I have read with a sport influence has only been about football with the occasional baseball setting thrown in. I enjoy watching the two sports but nothing to the extremes (except maybe the Cowboys...) but I definitely haven't done anything hockey related. Furthermore, I'm usually NOT a huge fan of alternating points of view (You can blame Cassandra Clare for that one). 
 So I was actually pleasantly surprised with the outcome of this book. I might have spent a little too much time reading this book in all of a few days but oh well. 
 So Shea: Can we just all agree Shea is absolutely amazing (The necklace was insanely adorable)? Other than him being whiny about Elli only all the time, I always kept wondering why he doesn't exist. However, I do have to join the Elli-hate train with all of her insecurities and I personally don't know how Shea managed to deal with her being all ""I'm not good enough for anyone!"" all the time. I get that a woman is usually never happy with herself but there's a point when it's pathetic and just looks like you want attention. Elli somehow managed to reach that point and give it a whole new meaning. Frankly, it drove me nuts half the half time and I'm glad her friends agreed. Oh and did anyone else find the whole Shea Adler obsession a bit creepy? Maybe that's just me not being accustomed to hardcore fangirling but you name your dog and have a whole him devoted to him... Grace and Harper definitely make up for Elli though. And the kids! How adorable! 
 Will I read the next book in the series?: Yes 
 Am I going to fall head over heels for the hero if he's anything like Shea(here's to hoping he is!)?: More than likely. 
 Will I complain about the heroine if she's anything like Ellie?: Damn straight."
3,Better than Pride and Prejudice and Zombies...
5,"Read in one day.... it is possible. I would so recommend this book.. Riley a sexy country girl first few ours in a new city. She steps into a club that is so way from what she considers her norm. Her sweetness and goodness is what makes her shine. A ready smile is what has Cade and Trevor floored. With Riley there isnt any pretending it just what you see. Riley and Trev as been best friends for awhile they share everything. Cade is determined to protect His club from innocents and when He spots Riley He is ready to throw her out. He thinks. Trevor is just as lost as Cade when He meets the blushing Riley naked under the covers with Cade. You can almost hear her brain waves ignite as Cade tells her she will obey Trevor as she obeys Him.(Cade). 
 The scene are shower worthy. As much as they are passionate and in need of Riley they are very protective of her and keeps her safety priority. She gives such a hot well pleasure response to both Cade and Trevor. You would have thought theyd have let her know how they felt about her. 
 A lil bit of danger lurks and strikes. Making Riley double think her intentions on staying with her Men. This was a delightful read. I had fun reading it the story line never bogged down and made you anxious to find our the end. Enjoy"
0,"DNF at 10% because toxic masculinity was so toxic that I went looking for trigger warnings (which I had neglected to do) and realized that (view spoiler)[there is sexual assault in this book (hide spoiler)]. So, yes, a good reminder to me to look for trigger warnings, and also a good reminder that my capacity to spot textual warnings early is pretty good. Thank you to writers who give them, I really appreciate that so much. 
 Also, I think books about queer and genderqueer teens are so important and I get that some of them should include things like sexual assault, and...I was excited to read a book about a masculine/butch/genderqueer queer girl, and am sad that it's not accessible for me."
5,"It's been a long time since I last read a book that made me think of this word: epic. 
 I read a lot of fantasy and paranormal books, among others, and I read a lot about angels, devils, mythological creatures, other worlds in other dimensions, magic, and whatever else you can think of in the genre. 
 None of them has ever been as epic as this book. 
 There are no hobbits, wizards, dragons, vampires, fairies, or werewolves, in Daughter of Smoke and Bone, though there are angels and many really interesting creatures, but what I love about this book is that there are two sides to every story. 
 Karou's side and Akiva's. 
 Karou is aligned on the side of the devils, such as they are. And Akiva's on the side of the angels. 
 I love how subtle the book is; the ""devils"" aren't really devils, they just don't fit our idea of beauty and hence, become labeled as ""devils"", but they aren't the bad guys in this story. 
 Not initially anyway. 
 The angels are beautiful and powerful, but also vengeful and destructive, and for all intents and purposes, are the bad guys in our story. 
 Except Akiva. 
 Akiva is Karou's main squeeze, like a classic Romeo and Juliet story. Only it's not their families that oppose their love, it's ALL their people, both sides of them! 
 I love how Laini Taylor portrayed both sides of the angels and devils. There are good and bad people in every group, many shades of grey in between, and the distinctions aren't always easy to figure out. 
 It's more than that though, I love how fleshed out the story is. The background, the myths and legends of each of their people, the history of the war and how it came about. 
 I feel like I really am transported into their world, I feel like this world really exists, somewhere out there, filled with these angels and devils, people with a history and a culture all their own. 
 Even deeper than that, I love how Laini Taylor made Karou and Akiva, and even Brimstone, Zuzana and Kaz, and all of the characters, seem so real to me. 
 Karou and Zuzana with their art and their tradition, the Poison Kitchen with its background and decor, Brimstone with his aloofness and mysterious penchant for teeth, Akiva's initial emptiness and then not... Where do I even begin with these characters? 
 I love how the story is told and unfolded as we get to know these characters better and they reveal themselves to us. 
 It feels like this book is a beautiful gift that I can slowly unwrap, and with every page I turn, I get something more beautiful. 
 I finished this book over the weekend and I'm now starting on the second book in the series, I can't wait to see what else Laini Taylor has in store for me."
5,Gosh! I love this series. Now I just hate waiting for the next one :*(
3,"This story picks up a year after the car crash that changed Ivy's life. Ivy's relationship with Will is steady and her best friend Beth is a great confidante. But now, a car crash ends Ivy's life. as she's between life and death, her boyfriend Tristan appears to her and kisses her, bringing her back to life. When Ivy gets back, many things also return to her... is she prepared to face them? Or is history going to repeat itself? 
 The author did a good job at pacing the story well, and all the characters were very likeable. In this book, heart stopping action is present from the very first pages. Its obvious that the author is riding on the Tristan/Ivy ship, but I love it so i don't really mind the sometimes cliched dialogue. I found this book an easy read, perfect for the book hangover I was suffering. I got immersed quickly in the series again, and I'm looking forward to reading the next book soon. I would give it a higher rating, but at one point I felt... kind of in a deja vu moment, because of something the main characters were going through. 3.5 stars."
3,"I have mixed feelings. In that I think I was confused for most of this book. And I also wasn't on board with the romance, like it just didn't work for me. I definitely liked the premise of the first book much better than this one. The plot here just feels forced. 
 Though to be fair I did tear up a bit when I finished, so at least I have somewhat of a soul!!"
3,This novella is told from Adam's POV right before the war with the re-establishment to shortly afterwards. It's interesting to see the change in Adam's feelings for Juliette.
5,"OHNYGODOHMYGODOHMYGOD! At first, I was kind of scared that it wouldn't be as good as Hex Hall, but it was EXCELLENT!!!!! Great job Rachel Hawkins!!!!!"
4,"4 Stars because it's script of play. It's not my favorite format. I knew that going in. It's why I was willing to be on a very long library waiting list, rather than purchase. It took me a bit to get past. 
 ALBUS & SCORPIUS! To quote Scorpius: ""My geekness is a-quivering."" They make the story! 
 I have long complained about the ending of Deathly Hallows. After so much discussion of careers in previous books, absolutely no mention what paths Harry, Ron, and Hermoine took. I was glad to finally have those questions answered. IMHO authors shouldn't announce that a series is done. It boxes them in. Had J.K. Rowling not done that, this could have been written as a novel. How about ""that's all the story I have to tell right now"" or ""maybe if the characters speak to me I'll have more to write""? Just my opinion I could be wrong."
5,"Okay, LOVED it! This is the third book in the series, and let's just say, it ties up everything pretty nicely. The first two books are very good too and keeps you wondering and guessing until you find the answers in this book. You just might go insane until you find out. 
 And you know a series is good when you're done with the last book and want to start all over again. And where you wish you lived in a world like that, even though it would be quite frightening. 
 WOW!"
2,"It's bad when you don't like the main characters of the story... I loved Connor, and Rose, and Ryke, but Loren and Lily were just not 'it' for me."
3,"3.5* for the 4 stories I read 
 I am not the number 1 expert or fan of short stories so please take my review with a grain of salt. This is the first SF anthology that I read so I am basically a newbie in this genre. I will review 2-3 stories at the time as I am going through other books at the same time and I would not want to forget what I read. 
 Tower of Babylon 2.5* 
 As synopsis the story is about people in the Old Testament reality which are building a tower to heaven and a surprise waits when they get there. The question behind this strange subject could be: How far should people go in the pursuit for knowledge? 
 ""Perhaps men were not meant to live in such a place. If their own natures restrained them from approaching heaven too closely, then men should remain on the earth."" 
 Understand 4* 
 A guy left with brain damage from an accident is treated with an experimental drug in order to regain his normal functions. The results are far better than expected. This story reminded me of Flowers for Algernon, a book I recommend to anyone. The main question here is again about knowledge. I one would get infinite knowledge what it should do with it? The story is very sciency and dense. 
 Division by Zero 3.5* 
 A genius mathematician discovers that she can prove that 1=2 and realizes that all she knew about mathematics will never be the same. 
 Story of Your Life 4* 
 This one was the best of the 4 stories I read, the inspiration for the Arrival movie. 
 Although I liked the stories I read, I wasn't to impressed. I lost the interest to continue with the other stories so I decided to give it up. I might come back to the remaining stories some other time but I doubt it. 
 *** 
 I just saw The Arrival which is based on Stories of Your Life story. It was amazing! You should go see it! Now I need to read the whole collection."
4,"I honestly really feel that this is a three star book, but I promised an extra star for the Pink Floyd reference, so..."
3,"While I really enjoyed a lot of the character development for previously built characters (for example, Draco was great, and I loved that they addressed Ginny's experience with Voldemort, as that's one of the reasons Hinny is a great ship and I support it), and I really enjoyed Scorpius, a lot of this play read like fanfiction. 
 I'm aware that it doesn't read like a novel because it's *not* a novel, but the plot feels very forced, and it damages already established laws of the Harry Potter universe. It takes the potency away from the events of POA, and while I enjoyed The Cursed Child while I was reading it, I'm not left with any feelings of satisfaction. 
 Ultimately, I'm annoyed that the play reduced characters to one-liners (hey there, Ron - also, where is George?), that characters behaved in such out-of-character ways (just saying, there's no way that anyone was calling McGonagall by her first name. It's Professor, or Professor McGonagall, or Headmaster... no one would address her by her first name as if they were neighbours borrowing sugar), and that Albus and Scorpius' relationship was clear gaybait. Unlike some reviews I've seen, I do notice the hints to Scorpius' feelings towards Rose, but I still think that the ideas of romance in this play are weird. 
 Also, good luck trying to convince anyone that character assassination was a good idea. You know which one I'm talking about. Not cool, and not even a little bit believable."
4,"Although this is not the best series I've read, I can't seem to stop. Darn good cliffhangers."
5,"4.5 / 5 stars 
 I really enjoy this book, is a good dystopian novel with a lot of action and a conspiracy theory plot. 
 Legend is told from two points of view: June and Day (I like that the font color was different for June and Day). 
 June is a kick ass heroine and Day is a great counterpart, both are intelligent with analytical reasoning(especially June, she analyze everything). And my favorite character is Day, he's protective, loyal, charming (in a peculiar way, he's like a modern Robin Hood)."
3,"I liked the story in general because you don't come across a book that often makes their main character not so special. but what really bothered me was the Main character's personality. It was pretty much like: 
 Ellie:Urg why is everyone treating me like a kid. I'm already 16. 
 *proceeds to ask very dumb questions and act impulsively"" 
 Me: go away plz."
5,"Oh my god, that was magnificent. I had no idea who the murderer was until the very, very end. And incorporating the children's rhyme into all of the murders was just...so creepy. I look forward to reading more Agatha Christie in the future. 
 Review to come."
3,"A fun little book from back in the day when SF was still cheesy and optimistic. The main problems here are a lack of any real tension, as our heroes are all infallible super-future-scientists who never make mistakes and can think their way out of any situation. Still, Rama has a sense of mystery which will capture the attention of anyone with a curious mind. Once Clarke introduces the giant metal alien box, it's hard to stop reading until you know what's inside. 
 Also, space orgies? Sheesh...70s sci-fi never disappoints..."
4,this series was just so entertaining and the last book didn't disappoint. I liked it just as the first two books.
5,"Mal is my favourite kind of sin. He's everything I like in a rock star hero and every bit as sexy as a book boyfriend. 
 He's also my favourite out of the band members. 
 Me having a thing for curly blonde haired guys, and green eyes has everything to do with it too. Fatal. Attraction. 
 Instant swoon. 
 But he was more than that. I like that he had many layers. Not just an attractive guy, but he felt so deeply for people he loved and he showed it, even when he thought he was putting on a front. 
 I like Anne. I relate to her in so many ways which made her relatable and easy to root for. I also like how she balanced out Mal. They were a dynamic duo. 
 The only complaint I have is the ending wasn't much of an ending. Just kind of cut off mid scene. It was weird. But other than that I enjoyed it."
5,That ending was fair at all.
2,"I wanted to like this story a lot because it's rated as seminal feminist SF, but I couldn't. In the end I had to abandon it about a quarter of the way in because it is so dry (please, not a pun). 
 Pros: Excellent concept, great science, interesting aliens (that call themselves human; I liked that it reinforced the idea that despite differences we are all human), and a good approach to a non-violent society. Lots of beautiful world building. 
 Cons: The characters were very flat and unengaging, there was no one to really like or get behind, even with their nuances (not even the anti-hero Spinel). The adherence to evo-psyche, that gender traits were inherent rather than socialized. A 2nd wave style matriarchy where all the men had no redeeming qualities and were responsible for violence."
4,"""Sometimes,"" Jem said, ""our lives can change so fast that the change outpaces our minds and hearts. It's those times, I think, when our lives have altered but we still long for the time before everything was altered-- that is when we feel the greatest pain. I can tell you, though, from experience, you grow accustomed to it. You learn to live your new life, and you can't imagine, or even really remember, how things were before."" 
 It was so weird. Today, I just saw this book in my shelf and it was like craving to be reread. It was more than a year already since I've first read this book and daaaarn, the feels are still there. 
 Personally, I think this series is so much better than the TMI series. I don't know, maybe because I think that TMI has way too many books? Maybe it's because of Jem and Will? Maybe because I don't like who portrayed as Jace in the movie? *preparing for the throwing of tomatoes on me* 
 And also, I'm on Team Jem and Team Will. I know, I know. This was one of the most well done love triangles of all time. I honestly didn't mind it! Will has his moments but I don't like it when he pretends to be mean. There's no pretense in being hurt. Words always cuts deep and sometimes, you can never take them back. Well, James Carstairs won his way to my freaking heart. Why do I love a guy who blushes? 
 ""Whatever you are physically...male or female, strong or weak, ill or healthy--all those things matter less than what your heart contains. If you have the soul of a warrior, you are a warrior. All those other things, they are the glass that contains the lamp, but you are the light inside."" 
 So okay. I loved them both IT'S CRAZY! 
 Right. Gushing over."
2,"Not what it was cracked up to be, but an overall all right book. Considering the rave reviews I had from every corner in picking it up, I expected more (especially in 500+ pages). 
 I could say a lot about what I disliked -- more than what I liked in the end, though the second half of the book made up for part of it -- but I'll keep it brief. The characters were, by and large, pretty two-dimensional. Clare was irritating for most of the novel, in a way I couldn't quite put my finger on, and Henry, while more fleshed out, still seemed to have some major issues that were never addressed (like his violent streak, which stuck out as needing addressing, and instead being viewed in a positive light). There was a hefty amount of unnecessary detail, and Henry and Clare's narrative voices seemed to be indistinguishable at times. The entire period from Clare's 20's into her early 30's was unbearably sappy and boring, and I grew exceedingly tired of reading them constantly have sex. 
 If it weren't for the second half of the book, when Clare and Henry seemed to become more human, to have real faults and problems and emotional issues, I probably would give this 1 or 2 stars. Niffeneger's prose is reasonably charming, but nothing to write home about. If you can get through the first 200 or so pages, it's worth a read; but that's a lot to slog through to get to something good."
5,Review to come!!
5,"It stands up just as good on the second read. Love Alanea Alder's writing style, and I have to say Meryn is so good, she makes me laugh out loud and I want more. 
 First read December 21, 2015 
 Love the humor, love characters, love the series. Can't wait for the next one to be released. It is building towards something major and I can't wait to see what it is. 
 Kendrick seemed a bit of a dick at the end of the last book, but this one he was different especially after he met his mate Anne. His big reveal was shocking but in a good way. 
 This series had been lots laugh out loud, Meryn is my favor oh my god the stuff that comes out of that girls mouth is hilarious. They all rock. 
 Can't wait."
5,"The book is very well written. I like how Vhalla discovered herself and how her friendship with Aldrik formed slowly and became something more. No insta love but a lot of delicious tension. 
 And of course the world of magic is so compelling! 
 I want mooore...."
5,Ghost was darker than all of the books before in this series and it was the best one so far.
2,"Okay, I didn't like how it started but as the book went on and I liked it more and more"
4,"I liked this one. I thought it was a little rushed at the end, I would have liked to have seen a more realistic conflict & resolution. The ending was too sweet for my liking but an otherwise enjoyable book. 
 Thanks Yasmine for the recommendation."
4,"Thank you to NetGalley and Sourcebooks Fire for an ARC of this book. 
 Actual rating: 4.5 stars 
 This was an interesting read. I, personally, haven't seen another book with this kind of premise so I was intrigued by the summary. I've heard about the struggles of people crossing the border but I got a better understanding of it in this fictional setting. 
 President Trump's wall seems more of a waste of money, time and resources, after reading just a little about the grueling journey these people already have to go through. 
 The characters were all likable. I wasn't always happy with some of their decisions but I was able to sympathize with them. I would definitely recommend this book!"
5,"Oh, this was even darker than The Young Elites, and I absolutely loved every second of it."

3,"3.5 stars. I thought this was an okay start to the series. I think I might have liked it more if I hadn't read the Infernal Devices trilogy first. The Infernal Devices was just so great that I felt like City of Bones just wasn't up to par. 
 The book follows Clary, a normal teenage girl who finds out that she's not quite so normal after all. She starts seeing things that she shouldn't be seeing and finds this whole new world, the Shadow World. She meets a bunch of other teenagers who turn out to be Shadowhunters (or demon hunters) and she discovers that she's one of them and that her mother hasn't exactly been honest with her. She quickly finds herself becoming part of the world and all the chaos that is involved... 
 While I enjoyed this book, I found myself constantly comparing it to the Infernal Devices and Clockwork Angel. The first third of City of Bones wasn't as atmospheric and exciting as Clockwork Angel. Clockwork Angel captures your interest straight away and City of Bones took a while to get me really interested in the story. I just wasn't as captivated by City of Bones and I found myself losing interest and putting the book down a lot. The pace of the book is a little bit slow at times and I felt like not much was happening. I think this was mostly because of the world building that was taking place but I thought Clockwork Angel was able to pack in a lot of world building while also being very entertaining at the same time. The last 100 pages of the book really picked up in pace and I enjoyed the ending. 
 There were some things that I found a little bit bizarre. The Shadowhunter world seemed so behind the times. There were some things in the Institute that seemed very anachronistic. Jace didn't know what eBay was and didn't really get some of the music references that Clary mentioned. And why don't they have cell phones to communicate?!! 
 I thought there wasn't a lot of character development in the book. We hardly get to know anything about the side characters and by the end of the book I still wasn't able to get a good sense of who Jace and Clary were. I didn't feel much of a connection to any of the characters because of that. t also found Clary to be very annoying for most of the book, and I couldn't stand Simon for most of the book either. Reading about these characters really made me miss Will and Jem and all of the Shadowhunters at the London Institute in the Infernal Devices trilogy. Hopefully the characters in the Mortal Instruments series will grow on me as I keep reading."
4,"Art and Marion are on the brink of bankruptcy and divorce when they decide to risk everything on a second honeymoon to Niagra Falls. It's a very simple story, examining in brief the reasons their marriage and finances have crumbled as they spend their days sightseeing and their evenings at the roulette wheel. The novel is short, under 200 pages, but it doesn't feel like a rushed job. Instead, it feels like a master storyteller exerting control. If O'Nan had kept the story going, he'd almost certainly have ruined it. The beauty here isn't in the complexity of the story, but instead in O'Nan's gift for capturing the mundane and the everyday in language that is fluid and lovely without outgrowing itself."
2,"Well what can I say about this ? This thing that I have read. Why did I read it in the first place? Two friends of mine recommended it to me showing me the cover. And may I say, the COVER is just AMAZING it's sooo pretty, so me being me, I decided to pick it up and give it a try. I know, I know, one should never trust captivating covers but what could I do? 
 Okay, so the book starts off with an obnoxious girl called America Singer, yes ,if your wondering, she is ironically a singer. I had to suck that up and proceed. 
 America lives in Illea, a future version of America that was founded after the 3rd or 4th (I won't even bother to check) World War by some guy named Gregory Illea. The kingdom is subjected to a caste system, ranging from being an Eight till being a One. The financial conditions of people are related to their caste, as the caste number is higher, the more money one has. America's a Five. 
 America is beautiful girl, who gets annoyed when people tell her she's beautiful. I mean seriously? What's so wrong about being told you're beautiful?!! 
 ""Please don't call me gorgeous. First my mom, then May, now you. It's getting on my nerves."" By the way Aspen was looking at me, I could tell I wasn't helping my ""I'm not pretty"" case. 
 She's in love with Aspen, a Six. This forces their relationship to be a secret, since her mother wouldn't approve of her daughter loving someone from a lower rank. 
 Maxon is the son of the King and Queen of Illea, and since he's 19 years old now, a Selection should be held for him. The Selection is a competition through which Maxon is going to chose his wife. 35 girls are selected to compete. America forced by Aspen, who oh couldn't live with the guilt of the chance that America could have a better life than the one she wants with him and her mother, enters the selection and is chosen as one of the 35 girls. 
 Basically, America hates the Selection and acts like a whiny child during it. She's torn between Aspen and Maxon, whom she surprisingly starts to have feeling for. 
 What I don't understand is why do people like Maxon?!! He's a two-faced-idiot!! 
 I mean take a look at this: 
 ""You are all dear to me. It is simply a matter of discovering who shall be the dearest."" 
 Gross, that is horrible actually, not romantic at all, not even remotely acceptable. 
 About the world building, there's isn't actually much building here, more like you are just faced with the fact that there's a caste system that rules the Kingdom and that ""Dear girls, history isn't something you study. It's something you should just know."" Seriously?! I mean like it's not like I was born in Illea to know its history! Moreover, there's a brief mention of rebels, Southerens, and Northerens. Apparently, the Southerens are bad just because they attack the castle and want to end the Selection, while the Northerens are good because they're just good. 
 Anyways, overall this book wasn't that much interesting, it was okay. If someone asks me if I recommend it, I would probably say that if you're able to endure some idiocity and nonsense, a non dystopian labelled as one, then go ahead and read it. The only thing that kept me going is that I actually liked Aspen very much. He's just too... I don't know, but I really liked him."
4,"4/5 stars 
 ""I guess a dying woman can be stupid if she wants. I'm crazy about you, Archangel. You scare the shit out of me at times, but I want to dance with you anyway."" 
 This was fantastic! It is an action-packed, paranormal romance book full of hot angels and vampires...what else could I possibly want? Angel's Blood is addictive, wholly captivating and takes you on a fun and gruesome journey. I've been on a paranormal romance binge recently and this book helped quench the thirst I have for romantic, excitement-filled paranormal reads. For lovers of paranormal, I would consider this a must-read! 
 Angel's Blood is the first book in the Guild Hunters series. It follows Elena Deveraux who is one of the finest vampire hunters in the job. She was born with the ability to sense the vampires which makes it easy for her to catch them and deliver the vampire back to their angel masters. No matter how good she is at her job, Elena doesn't think she's good enough for this new job that she's been assigned. Hired by one of the most lethal and powerful archangels Raphael, Elena is tasked to track a deadly archangel gone bad, a job that is seemingly impossible for any human. 
 Elena has no choice but to follow the enchantingly beautiful but deadly Raphael who has uncanny abilities to control minds of mortals like her. She is thrown in the midst of a dangerous killing spree from a wayward archangel that she must find a way to stop before he kills more innocent people. But it's also hard to fight the evil when her employer is focused on seducing her at every chance. She knows that their relationship cannot last and shouldn't ever happen, but Raphael seems to ignite a passion in her that is rivalled only by the desire that she ignites in him. 
 Even before reading this book I had a very biased opinion. This is because I love angels so much and any book that has them already steals a piece of my heart. Imagine my absolute joy to find out that the angels in this book were amazing and so well-developed. Angels, especially archangels, rule over certain parts of the world and are widely admired, lusted after buy also feared. They are the most powerful beings in the world and they know it. Their beauty is enchanting to humans and as they grow older, their powers of mind control and manipulation become stronger. I couldn't help but daydream about angels taking flight with their beautiful (and glittery) wings extending right before my eyes. If there wasn't danger at every turn, I would love to jump into this book just so I could get to see the angels. This book described them and developed them so well that I couldn't help but fall in love with them and relish in every angel scene, especially if it included Raphael (the hottest and best angel in the book). 
 ""I've seen enough. Let's go."" She struggled in his hold. 
 He tightened it, his wings coming around to cut off her view of the room, his chest hot and hard at her back. ""Are you sure?"" His lips whispered over skin so sensitized, she had to fight the urge to shiver. ""I have not taken a human lover for eons. But you taste . . . intriguing."" 
 I'd be lying if I didn't admit that Raphael made up at least 80% of the reason why I loved this book. Again, my obsession with angels had a lot to do with it, but he was also such a fantastic character. He was seductive, powerful but also surprisingly sweet and I couldn't help but be captivated by him. Elena may have been immune to his charm but I certainly wasn't! The other angels and vampires were also captivating and had a sort of powerful and magnetic personality much like Raphael. Overall, the male characters in this book were fun to read about and it's an understatement to say that I'm at least slightly obsessed with them (especially Raphael). 
 Of course the romance was a massive part of this book, but the world building and action-packed mystery took up the majority of the book. It was such an intriguing and unique paranormal world and I was completely hooked from the beginning. Usually, I'm not a fan of any sort of murder mystery or crime in books, but this was an exception. It was gruesome, violent but exciting in Elena and Raphael's chase to capture the archangel gone bad. I'm also not usually one for long series following the same main character, but I'll have to make an exception for this series because I couldn't stay away even if I tried! 
 ""And if I fail?"" 
 ""Don't fail, Elena."" His eyes were mild but his smile, it spoke of things better not said aloud. ""You intrigue me--I'd hate to have to punish you."""
5,"Rush Finally. You are the ultimate book boyfriend. I'm not done with the book yet, but so far I am in swoonville. I'll edit later! Sigh...."
4,"First book of the year! What a great way to start 2017 oh m 
 I am sO. DAMN. HAPPY. After the let down that I faced with 'Tell Me Again How a Crush Should Feel', this book felt like a huge breath of fresh air. And also a bit like a painful stab in my heart. But isn't that what great books are all about? 
 GOD, I don't even know where to start. This story was so painfully beautiful. It is all about love and getting to know each other and ourselves and to be okay with who we are. I am probably sounding so lame right now but it melt my poor little gay heart. 
 All the characters are flawless. AND ALSO. CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. SIGN ME UP. Emi grows so much throughout the whole story, being so obsessed with movies at first but then learning about life and how reality might sometimes be better than fiction. I could connect with her on so many levels; at first she was so heartbroken but, bit by bit, she rebuilds herself and finds her way out of it, and I think that's beautiful. Also, her inner monologue is so beautifully written. Nina LaCour's style made me fall in love from the very beginning, with the metaphors and amazing descriptions and beautiful scenarios and Jesus Fucking Christ, such a good book. 
 I don't know what else to tell you other than read this. It is so sweet, so warm, so light-hearted. LaCour grabs some pretty controversial issues but treats them with kindness and, at the same time, intensity. I am in love with all its components and details and twists and, of course, it left me crying outloud for more !! gay !!!! fluff !!!!!"
1,"Really interesting premise: A virus renders everyone over 18 infertile so only teens can get pregnant. Our main character (Melody) is the first to capitalize on this and makes it totally cool to be a professional surrogate -- only she has yet to actually ""bump"" with an appropriate specimen. 
 Sounds like the beginning of an excellent read but the actual story was so boring and so slow. Really, really annoying: the over-the-top Christian fundamentalist twin sister of the main character (Harmony), who spouts off all sorts of psuedo-religious exclamations (""Oh my grace!""); the ridiculous and overused slang (""MiNet"", ""verticality"", ""neggy""); the sex/not-quite sex/implied sexual nature (""everything-but""; Harmony's ""glorious"" event; getting ""bumped"", which I'm still not too clear on -- is ""bumped"" the action or is it the actual pregnancy?); and the alternating perspectives that never quite told the whole story. Ugh. Then, to add insult to injury, there's a cliffhanger ending (obviously designed for the sole purpose of publishing a sequel...which probably explains why the story was so slow-going in the first place). 
 I'm not sure why I kept reading this. I guess I was bored. But I think dystopian YA fans should give it a quick glance if there's nothing else around. Bumped has a good premise; it's just poorly executed."
5,"This was no Deputy Laney Briggs story... 
 While I enjoyed Laney and her antics, I was not prepared for the storm that was REBEL LOVE. Ms. Linton's writing style took on a bit of a more in-your-face dramatic turn in this newest endeavor of hers -- my guess would be because Laney and Gunner's story worked across a series, and this series will follow different people in this club, so there was more packed in a single book. 
 Regardless -- I loved it, and with it, have become a true Jodi Linton fan. 
 When Cade's partner, Wes, was killed while undercover infiltrating the gang with a female at the helm, he vows to avenge his friend's death. When his boss has him going in, that's his goal -- pretty woman be damned. He was not expecting to fall for her, though... 
 I loved the story of Cade and Em. Cade goes in with a chip on his shoulder and a mission, ready to put on whatever face he needs to get the job done. Em may have been born into the club, and the club given to her in her father's will, but she has some soft spots. I enjoyed her tough exterior, especially when paired up with her softer thoughts and fears. 
 The way Ms. Linton set it all up -- from Cade thinking about Wes to Em thinking about Wes in the very beginning, through the meeting and fall of these two, all the way to the big twist at the end -- was great. I was not expecting it to end the way it did! This series has the makings to be a great one, and I can't wait to watch it all unfold."
5,Wow... just wow! Amy Harmon never disappoints! One of the the best reads this year! *slow clap*
5,"This was an interesting read! I'd been looking forward to it for a while and it didn't disappoint. I was a bit torn between 4 or 5 stars because I just wanted more, I wanted to see and know more right away, I feel like I was presented with a very enigmatic world, one which I didn't have an opportunity to fully explore. But since I was still entranced by what happened one day later, and how much I still kept thinking about these characters and what will become of them, I knew that it was because it stuck with me so I had to give it 5/5. 
 The plot is quite straight to the point, and it is simple. That makes it easy to notice other details. The characters reactions and responses feel emphasized. 
 One of my favorite things about this was the supernatural aura, the descriptions, the ambience was just so good, it's so trapping - and that's easy to get because of how the characters react to their surroundings. How things happen. It's not even that it is an obviously haunted house, since it isn't even brought up by the protagonists themselves that soon or that often. But there's a glaring ""there's history behind all of this"" sign that makes you go and follow the plot, but puts a voice in your head anticipating for the real deal then. 
 Reading about Jeremy and how trapped in his mind he could get was frustrating because it's something that is so real, if that makes sense? We know why he reacted how he reacted, we know why he felt wary. He was lonely, he didn't feel secure so he had to latch to someone who did listen to him and reacted to him. It's just so human - especially at his age, and having been through the losses he's been. Seeing his gears turning, feeling what he felt but realizing too that something is wrong.(view spoiler)[ From an outsider's perspective it is clear that Hunter is a manipulative bastard. But even reading I did think that he was incredibly charming - it was progressive but his intentions became more pronounced. He wasn't a safe haven. He was making a closed off boy even more so. And it was great that Jeremy finally realized that on his own because he knew that Kennedy's intentions weren't ill-intended. It all hit him. (hide spoiler)] 
 Aside from how easy it is to get immersed in the environment, there's the relationships dynamic aspect too. The Stygian are a family, but whenever found families are mentioned usually they're all ""nice"" and seem to be supportive in a much more outright way. These guys clearly love and care for each other, but they're all so hurt and getting torn apart at the seams each by their own demons that they can't really afford any blatant kindness. It's easier to hurt others and push them away than oftentimes confronting our own issues. But persistence and love and care are what will prevail, and that's really why they're family. They try their best to understand each other, and they really are fond of each other. 
 (view spoiler)[It's hard to understand Watts, he cuts people with his words but then steadily it becomes possible to see through some of his defenses and what comes through is incredibly emotional and vulnerable. As if he were exposing a nerve. (hide spoiler)] 
 These are people who know that they can only really count on each other. They come all from different backgrounds but it shows that just anyone can be fragile or get hurt. So they come together as a band, Jeremy being the most recent member and helping the boys keep themselves steady. 
 As for the supernatural element: It's so smooth! I mean, you know it's there, but it's not super in your face, and it creeps up as you're reading and of course then there's no denying. It just comes off as a vibe, it meshes with their environment. (view spoiler)[The aura in the forest that made everything feel alright was such a good element too. It felt like a spell, it was supposed to lure, it was a bait. The way the vampires were very cool too. They were very much traditional blood drinking vampires who wanted to use people. Laurel was more savage than Hunter, but really, they wanted people for one purpose. 
 And ha! Quince did turn into a vampire! I mean, of course he had to be one if his silver watch burned him. (hide spoiler)] 
 More of these guys would be incredibly good!"
4,"I love all of Miranda's books. This book, just like the previous two, is life-changing, inspiring, and romantic. I read it in one sitting because I couldn't get enough of it. I loved all the characters, the way previous characters starred in the novel, and the relationship between Kate and Matt, the dynamic relationship between her and Will and Parker and even Drew. It was a slow progress but it was interesting, and the sweetness made up for the bitter bits of hardship underneath. It had a good, satisfactory ending that I really enjoyed. I'd love to read more of this author's books."
4,Very promising start to the series. I really liked Howey's storytelling and can't wait to learn more about the Silos.
2,"Sorry, but mildly chilling in exchange for a really long Reddit-esque post just didn't do it for me. I like Reddit. I'm a Redditor, and I frequent Let's Not Meet most days. This book just wasn't scary for me, or whatever it's trying to achieve. 
 I might revisit someday, but right now, DNF."
3,"Rating: 3.5 Stars 
 ""Everyone thinks their own situation most tragic. I am no exception."" 
 Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit is a fascinating short novel. I can best describe this as a 'coming of age' of sorts, although it reads as a memoir, streams of consciousness give way to parts of fairy tales, so as far as the writing style is concerned, Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit is not very straightforward. Perhaps I would have preferred if the author had avoided adding these 'tales' in between the main storyline. They didn't seem to serve much purpose other than in making the story disjointed. 
 The protagonist's' mind, Jeanette, often wanders around and in more than one occasion, her musings and feelings felt rather surreal. Her reflections could be a bit too whimsical and she could get lost in her train of thoughts. 
 ""What is it about intimacy that makes it so very disturbing?"" 
 Jeanette was a rather peculiar character. Still, she does make some poignant observations and could on occasions be rather amusing. Her bizarre attitude did make her hard to relate to; at times she seemed distant, disconnected from the events of her life. Despite the many occasions in which she describes her feelings and desires, I was unable to really know her. This could be also because Jeanette tends to lose herself in her own thoughts, she spends passages pondering on a certain determinate thing instead of simply telling us what she actually wants or wishes for. 
 The other characters were not really the focus of the story. Perhaps given that the narrator jumps 'through-time'without mentioning or giving us any updates on the other characters, one could find it hard to remember or care for them. Jeanette's mother especially lacks that certain something that makes a realistic, fully fleshed out character. 
 Despite this, Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit, is a rather compelling read that offers many interesting similes and metaphors that make up for the not fully fleshed out storyline and characters. 
 Of course that is not the whole story, but that is the way with stories; we make them what we will. It's a way of explaining the universe while leaving the universe unexplained, it's a way of keeping it all alive, not boxing it into time. Everyone who tells a story tells it differently, just to remind us that everybody sees it differently. [...] The only thing for certain is how complicated it all is, like string full of knots. It's all there but hard to find the beginning and impossible to fathom the end. The best you can do is admire the cat's cradle, and maybe knot it up a bit more."

 Review: Can't even remember how I came across this book, but I knew I had to read it when it came out in January. And then, one days I was trolling NetGalley for a good read and there it was. You better believe I requested that title like a boss. (Forgive me, I'm practicing my teen lingo since I'm in the middle of editing a YA project.) And I was so giddy when I got approved for it. 
 I loved all the real elements to this story. It's not soft, fluffy, everyone-lives-happily-ever-after fantasy (yeah, the uh, kind I write...) I love how strong Alexa is. I love the way she feels torn between her best friend and the prince. The romance in it is exciting and spine tingling. (Sweetness!) My only, tiny little pickyness is that the political parts seemed so big for the story. It was a little hard to keep track of the royal family and the opposing sides, but it didn't detract from the story at all. (Maybe I'll just have to read it again...)

1,"Full review on my blog, the Snark Theater. 
 Technically, aren't Alec and Isabelle also Herondales? (suddenly realized that they descended from Cecily, so...y'know.) I just feel like talking about a ""lost"" one is kind of irrelevant when there are already still a few. But even if we only considered patrilineal heritage for some reason, please don't ever bring more Herondales. Don't. Just don't. 
 Aside from that, 1) the Academy sends kids on a deadly mission while laughing at the thought of danger 2) the Academy's guest lecturers are fucking bigots and why why why why why is this happening 3) cowardice is the worst crime a Shadowhunter can commit and that should be enough to figure out why they suck so much as heroes 4) everyone acts like Simon should get back with Isabelle when he barely remembers her and I just hate it. It's terrible, and more importantly (to me), it really shits on the character of Isabelle."

 Love is one kind of abstraction. And then there are those nights when I sleep alone, when I curl into a pillow that isn't you, when I hear the tiptoe sounds that aren't yours. It's not as if I can conjure you up completely. I must embrace the idea of you instead.

 For some parts of the book I loved Ed. I knew from the beginning I should hate him because obviously he did something wrong. Duhh they're broke up! I understood Min's thinking (especially when I understood what Min was saying, seeing that Daniel's writing is not for the slow-brained; kinda confusing sometimes). I got why they broke up. And you will too! 
 This isn't a top of the line review but I must point out one thing: it reminds a little of Rainbow Rowell's Attachments mixed with Dash and Lily's Book of Dares. Very interesting!"
5,"This was fantastic! 
 Even better than the two previous installments and it just keeps getting better and better by each book. 
 I just love how every book seems to be focused on a virtue, like this one that was about sacrifice and doing the right thing when you know it's the only way to help those you love! 
 Ethan Wate is an amazing dude, I just idolize him. He is a person who would do anything, anything at all, for those he loves and that's what he did in the end of this book!! 
 And I was left gaping like an idiot and was turning pages to check if it sure was the ending of this book and when I realized it was I started screaming at my iPad. Yeah, well, awkward. 
 With every book every character seems to be evolved as person and that's what I love about this series because they ALL learn through their mistakes (except, maybe, for Ridley who I love but she keeps making a mess out of everything). But what's important is that you see what family means and what real friends are and how they all stand by you when the time comes. 
 I am just looking forward to reading the last book in the series although I am not sure I am quite ready to see it coming to an end.. I'm certainly going to miss it, anyhow."
5,"I can't on good conscious review this book right now, so I gushed and worshiped the series as a whole on this post here: http://superbookgrl13.blogspot.com/20..."
5,"Amazingly well written. Elements of a classic murder tale with a heavy bent towards the classics. 
 Some reviewers are claiming all the characters are pretentious; well yes, that is kind of the point. Everyone that the characters hated and deemed 'inferior' goes on to have a happy life, succeeding in one form or another. Everyone in their friend group ends up horribly, one way or another. 
 The obsession with the lost past, the history, is what destroys them. They try and revive the old world, and it fails horribly. The 'harsh beauty' that is so common in classical literature destroys them. 
 On a technical level, I think this novel was excellently crafted. The characters felt fully realized, the voice of the narrator was vibrant and had just the right amount of subtlety."
5,"This is what Goodreads is for, right? Bragging that you've also read the trendiest brick-like tome and that you fully understood it because of course you did? Letting your friends marvel at your excellent taste? Not letting on that a summer of post-college unemployment really gave you a lot of time to pick at this page by page, argue about pop culture on the internet, and post on your tumblr too much? 
 Of course it is. Note my use of the Oxford Comma in the last question."
3,"Every time a write a review for one of these comics, I seem to mention that another level has been breached. And that's because it's completely true. This one descended even further into depravity. 
 In the past we've had lots of violence, mutilation, torture and even rape. These have become almost casual things, trademarks of everyday life. In this crazy world this stuff happens every day. I hesitate to say that it's normal, it's not normal, but in a zombie apocalypse anything goes. There are no rules anymore. There's nobody to tell you that you are wrong and to punish you for your deeds. All that's left is opportunity and those who are willing to take advantage of others. Simply put, they will take what they want when they want it. There's very little to stop them. I'm of course referring to the Governor and his foolish following. 
 And Michonne, his latest victim, didn't let herself be defeated by such a brutaliser. What she did to the Governor was brutal poetic justice. The worrying thing about the whole situation is how easily she survives. She's obviously a strong woman, but such a decree of fortitude could only have been born from a life of hardship. Before the apocalypse, she must have had a real hard life; it's the only logical reasoning for how easily she picks herself back up. There's a lot more to her character, and I hope eventually we will find out exactly what keeps her going. This was another good volume."
5,Loved this book but I'm also pissed there's no sequel.
5,"A really fun, zippy read. I teared up a bit at the end, but it was mostly just good fun. 
 I really enjoyed how Sunny goes to Florida filled with dread, and then she meets Buzz. I loved watching her fall in love with comics, and dealing with growing up, and her family dynamics. I really love grandpa!"
3,"Ok so I was about to board a plane and I wanted something to read. I went to the airport bookstore and bought a couple of things on sale and this was one of those things. I didn't know it was part of a series (even less that it was its fiftheen book already). I was just expecting to find a fun and easy read, and that was exactly what I got. 
 The story is about a detective called Lindsay Boxer, that has a happy life. She has a small daughter, a nice husband, a great partner that is engaged to one of her best friends, and another two best friends whose husbands are also great. She is happy and loves her job. But her life soon turns upside down. 
 An asian undentified man is killed in an expensive hotel room, and a young couple is killed in the other. They know a misterious blond entered the asian's room at one point, but they don't have a clear shot of her face and all the cameras go dead after she enters. They identify the man and talk to his wife, but she has no clue at what he was doing in that hotel. A couple of days later, a flight just about to land is attacked with a missile and ends in a tragedy. They discover that a man with the exact name than the asian was on that plane, and his body was at the morgue but it dissapears. 
 While this is happening, Lindsay's housband disapears. It could be because he works at airport security, but she starts seeing him in the footage from the hotel and also from outside the asian's man house. Lindsay starts to think that maybe her husband is involved. Could he be he killer? 
 I liked the book. I liked the characters. and I liked that Lindsay didn't do stupid things like go and investigate all by herself. She is smarts and she talks about what she knows with her partner and superiors, even if she doesn't really want to. Im tired of main female characters that are way too selfish, do stupid things all the time and end up in aweful situations. Lindsay was smart and an acted like an adult. I also liked the other characters, they were all nice. A bit unidimensional, but I wasn't looking for something deep in this book. The plot soon escalates and the chinese intelligence and FBI become involved, and the ending was a bit on the silly side. But I liked that her relationship with her husband doesn't really come to a conclusion. I really want to read the next book, and maybe all the previous ones."
2,"OK... So, is there a part 2? Because the story feels ""abandoned""... Like she was bored of writing it and just stopped. 
 But, to be completely honest, I'm not all that disappointed. I mean in most stories there is a ""pick""; everything in the story lead to it and then matters get resolved. In FANGIRL though, there is no ""pick"" (Oh wait! Wren's OD incident. Hmmm... Not strong enough.) and the few issues it raises remain unresolved. Did Cath finish her Simon & Baz story? And if so, what happened to them? Did she get passed her intimacy issues ? (And don't tell me about all the kissing, because seriously, that chin fetish of hers was kind of creepy.) Why did Laura reappeared only to be a crappy mother all over again? Not to mention the biggest question of How on earth did Levi fall in love with her when she was constantly mean to him or kept him at distance... 
 There is this Bradley Cooper scene in The Silver Linings Playbook, where he throws a book out of his window because he wasn't satisfied by the end, and although I would never do that, this is as close as I have ever come to it."
2,"This is a very disappointing book. It's not even a very good chick-lit, humor book. It is only because I wanted to know what happened to the Bridget from the first two books that I kept reading. It was a really hard slog through page 180 - a third of the way through the book. It improved a little bit after that, but it was still very easy to put down - not a page turner at all. It really felt very superficial and emotionless especially for a book with a significant focus on finding a man/love/etc. 
 Reading tweets and text messages in a printed novel are unwieldly and made that much worse since Bridget's twitter fails were just not funny. That really dragged the first part of the novel down. 
 I know this is supposed to be a novel about a 50 year old woman, but the fact that 50 year old Bridget has kids aged 3 and 6, really makes her seem more like a 30 to young 40 year old especially since she worried about her attractiveness, etc, etc so much in her 30s. 
 Somehow Daniel has become a friend and sort of Godfather to Mark and Bridget's children! After his actions in books 1 and 2 that is just ridiculous and out of character for Bridget and Mark. He has a rather small role and it does seem Fielding is using him to make a point about the patheticness of the 50 year old playboy, but still. 
 The only great parts of the book were the few moments when Bridget remembered little moments of perfect happiness being married to Mark or the sadness of being his widow. The best moment of the book was when I was simultaneously crying and laughing over the Bridget recalling a very difficult (but funny to us) moment as a single mother where she then imagined how the scene would have been different with Mark, how two parents could have coped much better than one and then laughed about it together afterwards. 
 The heart of the novel is indeed about Bridget's relationship her boy toy Roxster, but (other than the prologue) it takes the novel nearly 200 pages to get her on the first date with him. He turns out not to be fuckwit, but despite their similar immaturity it's fairly obvious to the reader that he's not step-parent material and the relationship won't work out in the end. I was happy that these two manage to figure it out and part as friends eventually, but for Bridget it really just comes across as an interlude that goes nowhere. 
 The relationship with Mr. Wallaker (who is like Mark in the way Bridget needs her man to be) is just too rushed. They have an annoying long period of confusion where they both think the other is unavailable and then the confusion is resolved and the novel is over. By that point she has yet to actually call Mr. Wallaker by his first name. Seriously both claim to love the other before they've actually spent any time together; after all the time spent on Roxster I believe that Bridget loves him (although we barely know him from the diary) more than I believe Bridget loves Mr. Wallaker. 
 The 1-2 page ""Aftermath"" is an attempt to truly finalize Bridget's story (give her a happily ever after), but that's where I think the real potential for the heart of the story was but it was brushed over. (Although I admit that other than the kids/step-kids, it could have sort of rehashed Bridget Jones Diary and Edge of Reason). 
 I know the ""diary"" format gives us Bridget as an unreliable narrator, but taken at face value Bridget seems like a pretty horrible, selfish mother spending all kinds of time thinking about her boy toy and leaving her kids with their nanny especially since Bridget has a ""job"" where she can totally set her own work (from home) hours. I don't think she is, but I perhaps my feeling is left over from knowing that Mark Darcy loved her and trusted her with their children. 
 I have up to this point, reviewed the book I read and not the one I would have preferred, but I have got to say that I would have much preferred a married Bridget and Mark going through some trials and tribulations (without their relationship being in danger) than this. That would not have been a rehash of Bridget dating trials and irrational fears and I would have enjoyed some more of those few happily married sweet moments that Bridget recalled or imagined with Mark. Given the way Fielding rushed the Mr. Wallaker romance (who is probably rather like Mark relationship-wise), I can only assume that Fielding just didn't want to write that story again, but in that case I would have preferred she left Bridget and Mark to their happily ever after at the end of The Edge of Reason and used a new and different character. This feels to me like Fielding was trying to capitalize on the success of Bridget Jones because those novel have been far more successful than any of her others. 
 The novel was very disjointed. I really feel like Fielding just didn't know what to do with Bridget. There was a strange very short period where weight obsessed Bridget managed to drop around 40 pounds in a very short time despite her diary not documenting any kind good eating habits. (Maybe Fielding just focused on the funny failures like eating the meal replacement bars in addition to the meals.) Then Bridget develops an obsession with Twitter and her attempts to be funny on Twitter and pick up followers is the focus for another short period of time, but the Twitter-theme is dropped in favor of the boy toy. The relationship with Roxster is the center-piece of the novel, but it's fairly clear to the reader (from the prologue) that that's a dead-end and then the final part is very rushed when the story could have had a lot more pages. The novel just runs out of pages without really finishing Bridget's story."
3,I loved it when the scene from the cover art happened!
5,"My fourth Woodson book and maybe my favorite. Love, diversity and justice are the threads with which her stories are woven."
5,"** spoiler alert ** 
 THIS BOOK IS AMAZING! 
 First things first: I ship Em and Finn so hard. 
 Secondly: I cannot think of a single reason I would not recommend this book. The plot was fresh, the characters were amazing, and I just loved all the relationships-especially Em and Marina's. It was amazing the lengths Em went to to try and soften the blow of having to kill James. 
 Finally, I did have a problem with Marina. Not one so big that it ruined the book, but I just did not like Marina. I get that she had been so protected her whole life, but I just thought she was a materialistic little brat. She did have her moments, but I couldn't stand her, especially in the first few chapters from her point of view. 
 Overall I thought that All Our Yesterdays was an amazing book. I would recommend this book to my friends, and I plan on reading it again. I look forward to the sequel in this (planned) duology."
1,DNF OK I will admit that I had high hopes for this book but it just didn't pull me in. I have been watching the TV series and it is different enough from it to be separate stories but the book didn't give me anything to be interested in even Junior and his miss deeds just made me think REALLY... is that the best hook you can come up with??
4,"Another great story by Laurann Dohner. I love all her previous stuff and I was happy to see that she also does werewolves really well too. At first Grady seemed a bit assholish to me with his ideas of only mating a she-wolf. I mean the guy's half human, what's with all the hate? Well we learn that he's suffered because of his half-breed status so I kinda forgave him. The chemistry between Grady and Mika is smoking hot and I just wanted more...please."
5,Wow. This book was oh so amazing.
4,"Interesting book. Felt a little preachy, but flipped all of my triggers of anti-government fight the power buttons. Definitely reads like a YA book, but a fun read nonetheless."
5,"LITERALLY THE CUTEST CONTEMPORARY BOOK! It's about falling in love and fate. I read this in an hour which should be a new record! I enjoyed the plane ride between Oliver and Hadley. It was so cute when they fell asleep on each other. I am really happy for the ending. I really like the story and it's changes and feelings of the characters thought the book, one of my favorites contemporary I have read this year! I ship Oliver and Hadley, they are every couples' goals and how they met is really a cliche thing. Really cute, fun , and the feels in this story!!"
2,"Read this review on Got fiction? book blog 
 Noah Winters, Duke of Anselm is in need of a bride. It's very briefly mentioned that he has to marry before a certain year or something (it really wasn't detailed). Noah spends the Season courting a young debutante, who then becomes engaged to another man. Noah switches his attentions to her companion Thea. Being that Thea is the daughter of an earl, it's quite a good match. But this is never really mentioned as such. 
 The beginning starts of well, it's engaging and interesting, and I really liked that Thea was set on not accepting Noah's proposal, yet he convinced her. I liked how they interacted. 
 They get married, and...the book drags. 
 At first, they took it slowly. Thea isn't a virgin. After she became a companion (I guess to pay the bills? Until about 85% in, I thought she became a companion after she was ruined, not before? I feel like this book went in circles about the same topic many many times but never actually told us what was going on). Noah is angry, disappointed, feels betrayed, etc. He tells her they'll wait until her period before any more sexy times, just to ensure she didn't marry him because she was already pregnant and he was convenient. O-kay. 
 So for a couple weeks he ignores her sometimes, is sweet sometimes, leaves on lots of trips, and all manner of ways to avoid her. In London he visits his old mistress. She must be heroine to a book farther down the road or something, because otherwise I see no reason for that visit unless to set her up as a sympathetic character. I'm really glad everyone called Noah on it. He has a wife of a week, and is caught in Town visiting his old mistress? Gag. (note: I don't see any familiar names on the future books of the series, so how is this a prequel? And unless more books are coming, his mistress isn't a future heroine). 
 After Thea's period, they get back to the ducal baby making, and you can see they start to fall in love. This is still only around 30% in. This is a looooooonnnnnggggg book. I hated how Noah kept bringing up Thea's past, but then would be think that she's obviously upset, let's take a nap, or go on a picnic, or get naked...he wanted to know so much about her past, but then he'd randomly stop when she'd tell him about it. For the record, she was raped while she was a companion. This seems like it should have been said in one of their million conversations that they have. Seriously. This book was one giant conversation. And it was always the same conversation! 
 Then to top it off, Noah has two little girls he's been hiding upstairs. He never tells his new duchess this. She finds them, or rather they find her, and she assumes that they're his. He knows this and never tells her differently. They are his cousins. He has taken responsibility for them, and the girls tell her this, but she doesn't believe them, and he never tells her differently until about 95% in, and it's mentioned so off-handedly by someone else. Noah's answer? They'll talk about it later. Jerk. 
 The worst part is, that Noah is actually a very patient, loving, and kind man. But a couple of stupid choices make him look like an ass. Thea isn't much better. One conversation. Just one, would have fixed much of this. That and cutting about 30% of this book. There was no need for it to drag on like that. 
 Okay, now that you have an idea of what's going on, I'd like to say that I really enjoyed the plot, and to an extent the characters. What I can't seem to like is the fact that over and over and over again, these two have the same conversation ten different ways, and nothing is ever resolved. Ever. 
 At the end, the villain of the piece is given ""a fast horse and sufficient funds to get to France"" courtesy of the Duke's brother. I mean seriously? Seriously? That's how he's dealt with? He's given an escape plan and money? That's awful. The author built him up as the kind of person who of course will come back and try for revenge, so why let him go? 
 I also think that maybe this author isn't for me. I know I've read Burrowes before, and I don't want this to be my last. I have a couple of her books at home, but still...I'm not all that excited to continue on. 
 The good-this may be a prequel to her new series, but it's a full-length novel! And a loooong one at that. So if you're a Burrowes fan, you'll be in heaven! 
 If you don't mind taking the long way round, you'll probably enjoy this as well.

4,"I finished this book in one day woop woop! I really love all the quirky characters and it was just pure bliss to follow Alex and Connor on their last adventure. The only thing that bothers me a little is the ending. (view spoiler)[I don't think I wanted to read abour Connor when he was old and can't even remember Alex. I rather just remember him young and alive, and also Bree death... nooo, I wasn't ready to read about her death even though it looks like they got their happily ever after. And are all their kids adopted? I had a hard time believing that none of them believe in fairytales considering Connor and Bree are their parents (hide spoiler)] 
 So sad to say goodbye to this series. Will definately re-read it in ten years or so when I have forgotten most of the plot. 
 Review to come."
4,"An incredibly beautiful book. Doesn't make me want to run out and grab more of her books up though. I think it's b/c the ending felt rushed. I spent the entire book on the edge of my seat for this race to happen and when it did, it felt as if the author was less interested in it than I was. Won't be an issue for many, but it kept it from being a 5 for me."
5,"no spoilers, but here's a synopsis 
 First: I would definitely recommend this book to anyone! Okay...maybe not to devout Christians or Catholics -- they might be a little upset with the satire. However, if you find yourself with an open mind, do read this book. You will NOT be disappointed. At times it is just downright funny; at other times, filled with wisdom. 
 The main premise is that God is dead and that his huge body (2 miles long, with 7 million tons of displacement)has fallen into the sea from Heaven. The angels get in touch with the Vatican to give them the news; the Vatican sends the angel Raphael to one Anthony Van Horne to tell him that his mission is to tow God's body into the Arctic ocean from where it is off the coast of Africa and deposit it into a specially-prepared iceberg. There's one slight problem: towing God's body would require a huge ship, much like the one that Van Horne was captaining when it ran a reef and spilled enough oil to cover every living creature with tons of oil. Since that time, Van Horne has lost his license. But the Vatican comes to the rescue: not only will Van Horne get a new license from Brazil, he will also be getting back the very ship that wrecked on his watch, now repaired and ready to go. Van Horne, who can't shower enough to get rid of the oil on his conscience, is of course wary; but Raphael tells him that if he does this, he will gain redemption. Van Horne agrees to do the job. There's a catch: because the Vatican supercomputer predicts that while God's heart has stopped functioning, his brain may still be alive, and so they need to get God under ice within a certain time frame and make a quick journey. How does the Vatican explain all this? They launch a huge cover up (another side benefit to this book -- the ""Vatican conspiracy"" plot) saying that there has been a gigantic spill and the Vatican is financing a mission to clean it up. 
 So Van Horne sets out with his hastily-picked crew, picks up God's body and starts the journey north. Then the first of many problems occurs: the crew receives a distress call from a woman who had been traveling as part of a biologist team on a replica of Darwin's The Beagle, which was wrecked in a hurricane and left her stranded on a small island which was nothing more than rocks filled with guano. Van Horne wants to send someone else after her; the Jesuit priest on board says that they must pick her up and save her. God would have wanted that. So they rescue the woman, who is an ardent feminist who belongs to an Enlightenment society and the trouble begins when she realizes what the ship's mission is. I'm not going to say another word about the plot so as not to give it away. 
 What I will tell you is that Towing Jehovah is a brilliant piece of writing. For example, on page 118, the priest Tom and the nun Miriam are taking a drive on God's body, with the music ""Also Sprach Zarasthustra"" in the background, discussing how God died. The priest argues that ""he died from a bad case of the twentieth century."" On the next page, they get into a discussion of Nietzsche -- wonderful! Don't forget it was Nietzsche who gave the famous quote ""God is Dead."" And it's not just the Vatican that gets the brunt of Morrow's satire: Jews, feminists, evangelicals and others as represented by the crew members also fall victim. Even atheists & agnostics are examined: on page 135, the priest notes the effect that the discovery that God was dead would have on the world's population: 
 ""In the old days...whether you were a believer, a nonbeliever, or a confused agnostic, at some level, conscious or unconscious, you felt God was watching you, and the intuition kept you in check. Now a whole new era is upon us."" 
 And again, on 181, Miriam wonders about the post-theistic age and what's in store for the new postdomini world. 
 There are some really funny moments in here, including a stint where the crew is starving after they run aground on an island created from Europe's garbage & refuse and are forced to eat from God's Breast -- which includes a recipe for Dieu Bourguignon. But at the heart of this story is the question of how and why God died -- and the answer may surprise you. 
 I cannot say enough about how marvelous this book is and I would strongly recommend it."
3,This was a quick read that felt light. It offered a less violent look at a post apocalyptic world that I found delightfully engaging.
4,"This was much better than I thought it would be--I expected paranormal romance, and got a great paranormal werewolf story. There was no sex, but a lot of sexual tension. The narrator is spunky and smart and holds her own in the male-dominated world of werewolves. I'm very excited to read the next in the series, Blood Bound. 
 I picked this up because her newest book, Cry Wolf, is on the NYT Bestseller list, and there was mention of the book taking place in ""Mercy Thompson's world."" I'm glad I decided to read this book first. It's hard to find a good werewolf novel!"
4,4.5 stars. Surprisingly wonderful book about angels! Review to come.
4,"I'll be honest, I started getting really worried rereading this because I loved this series as a child. I wanted to reread the series so I could read Clariel. anyway, the first half of lirael was sooo slow I panicked slightly that I wasn't liking what was a FAVE series back in the day. not to worry, things finally picked up! However I do think that the first half was unnecessarily slow. it felt a bit like second book syndrome to by honest. What boosted it though is the fact I love this world and magic system. after the halfway point things finally start happening and now I'm reminded of why I loved these books in the first place."
5,i loved this SO much! the plot was super engaging and the prose was GORGEOUS. i could easily see this becoming one of the next big things. highly recommended!
4,"Actual rating 3.5 
 I'm going to be completely honest the first half of this book felt like walking through wet sand. It just took a really long time and it wasn't very pleasant. I really despise Arthur, I felt as though he had absolutely no redeeming characteristics. Also the structure of the book, just kind of threw me off, throughout the entire book. I guess I really wanted a bit more of how everything worked in the post apocalyptic world. I felt as though so many things were touched on, but never went into any detail. 
 My bookclub read this or the month, and our discussion was today. People had such a wide reaction to this book, some people thought the people in the book were absolutely stupid and why did they not do more in the 20 years after the pandemic. Then there were others that believe the book was about survival and everyone was simply doing everything possible to survive. I think it is hard to judge people when you have never been in the situation, but I really could see both sides of this argument. I do have to say it made for a very lively book club chat, for sure!"
3,"""She should just shoot him!"" 
 Hemlock Cove, Michigan rebranded itself as a tourist community appealing to the paranormal. Most of the shops are owned by normal townspeople. The bed and breakfast is owned by the Winchester family. The family is known for its long history of witches. Bay is the town's newspaper editor and her ""gift"" is the ability to see and hear ghosts. Bay discovers a body while visiting a local corn maze. The teenager's ghost quickly attaches himself to Bay to help find his killer. 
 This was a cute, quirky little book that went very quickly. I love Bay's cousins, Clove and Thistle, who are her room mates and herb shop owners. The girls' mothers run the bed and breakfast and all vie for the local sheriff. Great Aunt Tilley is a force to be reckoned with! Throw in a biker gang with a hunky member, moonlit rituals and kooky spells for a fun filled ride. I did pretty much figure out who the murders were and why the one hunky guy was with the riff raff but it was still a good read. I look forward to reading the next one in the series. 
 3.5 stars"
5,"5 out of 5 Amazing Stars! 
 Wow, I can't believe it took me so long to read this book! 
 White Cat 
 by Holly Black is absolutely amazing. She created a new world that was very similar to the one we all know, but added one factor that changed everything - she created Curse Workers. And the best part about creating these new powers is that Holly Black doesn't overwhelm the reader with information, but instead adds bits of history that enables the reader to understand how the world is the way it is. The story/plot-line is faced paced, grabbing your attention and not letting go until the end of the novel. It is intriguing, and most importantly it is realistic, believable, it made sense! There are so many novels that don't make sense or aren't relatable or believable because the authors decide that something is going to happen within the novel ""just because they say so."" That is definitely not the case with White Cat. 
 Onto the Characters... 
 Cassel 
 ""The easiest lies to tell are the ones we want to be true."" 
 Poor Cassel is the outsider in his own family. His mother, his brothers, his grandfather, everyone in his family but him is a curse worker. He used to pretend to be ""the most talented practitioner of the very rarest curses"" until he grew up and realized that he would always, in some way, be segregated from the rest of his family. But he doesn't give up, and he certainly isn't useless. Cassel knows to ""lie until even you believe it - that't the real secret of lying. The way to have absolutely no tells."" He's smart and conniving, but also realizes that he makes mistakes. This humanizes his character, allows the reader to relate to him. Eventually, though, Cassel's life changes in a way he could have never imagined, and realizes that ""he was such an insider that he never even knew it - he was inside of the insiders."" Cassel realizes that people are losing their memories, and the conflict of the novel is set up, allowing our hero to investigate. Twists and turns will keep the reader guessing. 
 Philip and Barron 
 I don't want to spoil anything from the novel, but I have to say that these are some of the worst brothers! You'll have to read for yourself to find out how bad, but this quote gives a good idea: ""it's like I'm watching us all in a fun house glass, a parody of a family gathering. Look at us celebrating our criminal enterprises. Look at us laugh. Look at us lie."" 
 Sam and Daneca 
 Cassel goes from putting up a fake front at school, from believing that ""all friendships are negotiations of power to thinking that ""maybe the point of real friendships isn't that you have to repay kindness, but whatever."" Quite a change, which is due to his forming friendship with Sam and Daneca. They both surprise Cassel when they help him, and eventually become some of his closest friends, which he proves by trusting them with some important plans toward the end of the novel. They're great characters that help bring out the best in our hero. 
 Lila 
 Lila is a very interesting character, and has a strong female role. It's terrible what happens to her, but she and Cassel make a great team. I really like her character, and wish what happens at the end of the novel didn't happen, but maybe everything will work itself out (hopefully). 
 Final Thoughts 
 White Cat 
 by Holly Black is an amazing novel that everyone should take a chance on. It is a bit predictable in the beginning, but once certain facts are revealed, it's almost like a guessing-game for what is going to happen next. The very last scene of the novel ends on a sombre/almost morbid note, but is truthful. The game will never end, the cons will not stop; it's almost brutal in it's honesty, but I wouldn't want it any other way. I can't wait to see how Cassel's life will now change, what the future holds in store for him, but I'm sure it will be one hell of a ride. Time to get my hands on

5,"Oh my Clark Gable. This was wonderful. 
 Let me first say this: I think the writing style in this book is either something you will love or hate. I, obviously, loved it. 
 I felt like I'll Give You the Sun was poems and diary entries turned into a novel. I liked all of the main characters, despite their shortcomings and the bad decisions they made. They felt as real and broken as anyone I would know. This entire novel was so life-like, so beautifully heartwrenching and heartwarming. I could probably write sonnets on this book. I could re-read it to every person I know. I do wish Brian and his past could have been expanded upon, but that's not going to happen unless the author releases an add-on to the story, which is doubtful. 
 In short: read a few pages before you buy it. If the writing style doesn't turn you off of it, I believe it may just steal your heart. 
 Edit: I also wasn't pleased with the occasional use of ""surftard"" and I believe two separate uses of ""slut"" in this book. (Not spoken directly at anyone though. At one point I believe she refers to herself as slutty when describing what she thinks her mom thinks of her.)"
4,YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE IT THERE. D:
4,I think this was a really big eye opener and something every teen and parent should read.
2,"1 star for the DOD twist, 1 star for the Luxen and Arum still being pretty kickass. I had to force myself to finish this book. The first 40-50% of it was incredibly blah. Katy seriously annoyed the crap out of me, the love triangle didn't serve any purpose but to piss Daemon off, and I'm just really apathetic about this series now."
4,"In book 3 of The Mediator, Suze becomes the personal bodyguard of a male classmate named Michael who was in a car accident and killed four students from a rival high school. Those kids, dubbed The RLS Angels by the media, are pissed about being dead and want to kill Michael. 
 Meanwhile, Suze's BFF from Brooklyn, Gina, is in town visiting. Gina kind of knows about Suze's ability, but only because a carnival psychic told Suze she was a mediator in front of Gina. 
 The end of this book is sort of hilarious... in a violent, poetic justice kind of way. 
 And of course, my boy Jesse is there to watch Suze's back. And... could sparks be flying between Suze and Jesse now?"
5,Twisted and delicious until the very end. As much a story of self-discovery than a murder mystery. I looooved it.
5,"Amazing book in this awesome series. Loved the kinky sex and relationship between the MCs and the secondary characters are complex, quirky and wonderfully developed. These books are fun, quick reads with some nice paranormal elements to spice things up. Interesting mythology, sparking chemistry and a main protagonist who is snarky and fun to read ;)"
4,"This review was originally posted at Vampire Book Club. 
 The Georgina Kincaid series is Richelle Mead's lightest work, in terms of tone. Often witty with plenty of laughs, Succubus Blues will still bring you to the edge with coiled intensity. 
 Georgina Kincaid is a succubus. Her immortal life is sustained by taking the life force of men during sex. Her boss archdemon Jerome wishes she'd seek out good guys, corrupting their souls. Instead Georgina seeks out the lowlifes. It's a smaller boost, but she feels less guilty about it. She keeps in touch with humanity by working at a local bookstore. 
 When her favorite author comes in for a signing, she's excited, until she realizes they have a bit of a connection and he's now going to stay in Seattle. She does her best to make it clear she doesn't date -- Seth is a good, shy guy -- but the two develop a great friendship with undercurrents of wanting more. It's easy to root for Seth. There's something about the shy guy, who can be eloquent in an email but fumble in person, that's just too sweet. 
 But other supernaturals Georgina knows are showing up killed and beaten. Jerome and his angel BFF Carter won't give her any details, but tell her to be careful. She can't just let the bosses handle it, because she knows they are hiding something. Taking matters into her own hands gets her answers, but also puts her directly in the sights of whoever is attacking them. 
 The concept of a succubus who wants real love, but avoids it because she refuses to hurt a good man is brilliant. It is one of the key things that makes a succubus as a heroine work. She doesn't want to steal souls. She wants love. And we want that for her. 
 Re-reading Succubus Blues was such a treat. I forgot just how much fun one has with Georgina Kincaid. It's not just the heroine that makes this series, Mead makes assembled fun supporting cast from Georgina's best otherworldly friends to the bookstore staff. It was a treat to fall in love with her, Seth, Doug, Cody, Jerome, Carter and Peter again. 
 Sexual content: Two sex scenes."
5,"""If you're going to make a desperate, hopeless act of defiance you should make it a good one."" 
 Given its many accolades, I thought it would be impossible for Ancillary Justice to live up to its reputation. It surpassed it. 
 It's a little hard to describe Ancillary Justice. I've seen it called a space opera, and I suppose it is. I've seen it called a dystopia, and I suppose it is that as well. But to me, it came across primarily as a love story. Not a romance, mind you, but a love story, a tale of devotion and perseverance and friendship and heartache. Or maybe two love stories, and unusual ones at that. Love stories packed into a complex and imaginative far-future world and imperialistic alien culture. 
 This book is perhaps most notorious for its use of pronouns. Esk, the narrator and an ancillary body of a ship's artificial intelligence, comes from a culture that doesn't have a concept of gender. She simplifies matters by speaking of everyone with female pronouns, even when she is speaking of cultures who do care about gender, although she occasionally makes a blind guess when speaking to others: 
 Since we weren't speaking Radchaai I had to take gender into account--Strigan's language required it. The society she lived in professed at the same time to believe gender was insignificant. Males and females dressed, spoke, acted indistinguishably. And yet no one I'd met had ever hesitated, or guessed wrong. And they had invariably been offended when I did hesitate or guess wrong. 
 It is disorienting at first, and is as good as an implicit bias test at demonstrating our many preconceptions about gender. Then it just becomes part of the story. The issues of identity experienced by the main antagonist are equally pointed, but no less effective for it. (view spoiler)[I had real trouble keeping track of which Mianaai was which, but I think that was the point. As Esk 19 points out, ""How are we supposed to tell them apart when they're all the same person?""As she also says, ""It doesn't matter whose side anyone is on. It doesn't matter who wins, because either way it will be you and nothing will really change."" (hide spoiler)] 
 I think your experience with the book will depend on how well you deal with the pronouns, whether you like flashbacks, and how much you warm to the characters. Personally, I found myself empathising deeply with Esk; apart from anything else, she has a subtle sense of humor I thoroughly enjoyed. But the core of this book is its ideas. 
 Apart from gender, the story explores dehumanization, and civilization, and righteous certainty. Esk's world is made up of people who believe they are doing the right thing, even if perhaps this is because they don't look too closely at the ramifications of their actions. The Radchaai are an imperialistic culture; they invade to bring civilization--the very word ""Radchaai"" means civilization-- to other worlds. 
 ""Any measures are justified in the name of civilization."" 
 And, of course, the Radchaai are so invested in their culture that they cannot see the inherent injustices in the system. 
 ""Here's the truth: luxury always comes at someone else's expense. One of the many advantages of civilization is that one doesn't generally have to see that, if one doesn't wish."" 
 I don't think anyone would call the story subtle, but the way it explores these issues is multifaceted and nuanced. 
 Ancillary Justice is a beautiful book. For me, at least, it fully deserved every last bit of the hype. On to Ancillary Sword."
4,"It is always bittersweet finishing a series. There is this feeling of depression that you won't be with the characters you've came to love, rooted for, and swooned over. There is also, at least for me, a feeling of accomplishment and closure (provided that the author delivers.) And Lauren definitely delivered in Sever. 
 I got caught right back up into Rhine's world. Cecily is grown so much, and it was quite a journey in Sever to see her develop so much more. She is such a unique type of character, and I can't really describe how reading about her has effected me. She has some heartbreaking scenes in this one, and I didn't know how I would handle it. 
 Linden is as sweet and generous as ever, if still blinded to what is around him, but luckily the women around him and Reed, his uncle who I adored by the way, help to make him see the world and his father the way it really is. 
 I love Reed's inventive and curious nature, as well as appreciating him offering his house and protection. The conversations he had with Rhine were great, and I loved his teasing nature. I wasn't expecting him as a character, but he turned out to be great. 
 Rhine's search for her brother, and figure out the truth or not about what he is saying. She wants to show Rowan that she is alive, and also get some of the answers that he seems to hold about her past, and hopefully the hope that they cling to for their future. 
 I flew through this and did not want to put it down to eat or sleep, and did so only reluctantly. The characters are beautifully written and captivating. Rhine's emotions and motivations are easy to relate to. I still had a hard time with her pushing Linden away, but I knew that she had to find Gabriel. So, in essence for most of the book, you know until THAT thing happened, I was still torn over who she should be with,and who I would pick for myself. Linden is a hard one to choose though because of the sharing and sister wives deal. 
 The ending floored me, it was things that I wasn't expecting, hoped against hope wouldn't happen, but there was also hope and good things that happened. I know that it is a good and fitting ending, but I am still kinda in shock over the events, and dealing with some loss. 
 I can't believe that I have to say goodbye to these characters. 
 Bottom Line: Bittersweet conclusion to an amazing trilogy."
3,"Read in a couple hours. 
 So, I liked the story. I'll probably re-read it, like I have with most of the Aurora Teagarden novels. 
 A long series shows a lot of cracks, and once you see them, you can't unsee them. Harris details the mundane... a lot... the heroine is a bit self-absorbed and can do no wrong in the eyes of anyone (common problem with Harris's heroines)... and Harris introduces a lot of characters that seem unnecessary. The last one is my pet peeve: Think of Chekov's gun in Act 1: it better be used in Act 2. So, for example, why introduce a crime blogger that Robin used to probably date, unless you want to introduce infidelity? Or, introduce her, that's fine, but who cares how they became friends since, duh, they're both crime writers so it's an obvious co-worker type deal? Are you trying to show Robin is *SOOO attractive* or Aurora's jealous tendencies? Lots of speculation for a character who's in and out in four pages. Oh wait (view spoiler)[ there's another book Sleep like a Baby coming this fall where a dead woman ends up in their backyard. Who's taking bets on Scarlet being the mystery woman? And also, yes, the book blurb implies possible trouble in paradise. (hide spoiler)] 
 On the bright side, Roe's ex-boyfriend cop is finally out of town so we don't have to deal with his nonsense. Mentioned and dropped, and, BTW, replaced by a cop Aurora met two books ago with a similar random introduction. 
 Also, my friend once described Doctor Who and Jessica Fletcher as if they are stopping by, expect $&!^ to happen. Apparently Aurora has Jessica Fletcher syndrome. 
 Despite these complaints, it's after initial reading at the top five of the series for me, but could slip after re-reading, dunno. It is the second hostage situation in these books, and way better than the first one. 
 I was truly surprised at the culprits, even though signs pointed to their involvement at least. Real psychopaths."
5,"I can't ever get enough of these characters!! 
 I want the next one - NOW!"
2,"Initially this book was a lot of fun, but as the story progressed I found myself skipping parts and paragraphs etc. There honestly wasn't a real or strong storyline. And don't get me wrong, I love sex in books, but there's only so much I can take (!!!) especially when the story itself is lacking substance. And I also really didn't like the heroine, in fact, a lot of the characters were quite annoying, (her mum was a real fucking treat.) Although I didn't mind Eric, it was nice he wasn't your usual Bad Boy in a band kind of thing. Overall, I'm not really impressed :/ and I couldn't really tolerate the story and how unrealistic it seemed."
5,"The word ""awesome"" is not big enough to describe this book. Engrossing. Thrilling. Glorious. It was joy to immerse myself in Maureen Johnson's world."
3,"3.5 
 I think my expectations were a bit misguided based on the book summary. I had (in my mind)an expectation of a serious mystery, paranormal in its essence, but dark and dangerous too. In some respects, I was right. However, this story just fell a bit flat for me. 
 The story takes place through the eyes of a middle-aged man who is back home for a funeral and he finds himself at the end of the lane of his childhood home. While here, he remembers a time of monsters, magic, and mystery when he was 7 years old. It centers around the Hempstock family, and the daughter. Eleven year old Lettie protects the character in ways that he did not knew existed. Now, as an older man, he has some vague recollections about this kind family but memories can be deceiving. 
 This story reminds me of When A Monster Calls by Patrick Ness except the metaphors were somewhat elusive to me. Or maybe it is just because I haven't had to use my brain all summer...someone else read it and tell me!!"
5,"This book was absolutely astounding. I am shocked I didn't cry my eyes out but I know this could be because I saw the movie beforehand. 
 Watching this disease take each part of Alice is heart-breaking. Seeing her slight confusion to not recognizing her children just hurts so badly. Seeing the stigma and awkwardness between every interaction and how this just ruined her marriage killed me. I resent John but I also understand where he is coming from. 
 The understanding and patience that Lydia has for her mother is so touching. It's devastating for their relationship to only really grow and develop when Alice is diagnosed but I think it's also wonderful how these situations can bring families together. 
 Anyways, I really enjoyed this book and I had a hard time putting it down at times. Definitely worth a recommendation and eventual reread."
3,"7/10 
 Well...that was NOT what I expected. At all. I really liked it at times, but I never completely fell in love with it. I think that's because I was solidly on ""Team Human"" and though I felt for Wanderer (and Ian!!) I always wanted more from Melanie and Jared. This is a LONG book, and parts of it dragged a bit for me - I found myself skimming (reading only the dialogue) a few pages ahead often, but then my OCD would kick in and I would have to go back and read every word...that made it seem even longer. 
 I spent MUCH of this book at a very high level of frustration because I was being forced to relate to this parasite (and, much like Jared, I held her at arms length emotionally as LONG as I could) and what I really wanted was more Melanie...human victory...alien destruction! LOL! I am impressed that Meyer was able to bring me around to caring for her (almost) as much as I did for Melanie - though it took me longer than it took most of the humans to accept her, which I thought was a bit unrealistic - though, what do I know, desperate times and all..maybe they are quicker to adapt to change. (view spoiler)[ I saw Ian coming from a mile away, but his kindness (and eventual love) are what finally enabled me to connect with Wanda. (hide spoiler)] 
 Another frustrating part for me was the inconsistencies in Wanderer's aversion to violence, as well as the soul's ""altruistic"" nature... 
 Example: Wanda is unable to lift a rock against a human who is trying to KILL her (she can't stomach the violence), yet when she tells the story of the claw beast she jumps on its back and slashes open the back of its neck in order to insert another soul...really??? 
 And the over-arching inconsistency, the fact that she is so completely selfless, only able to do what is right for others and for the greater good (repeatedly this is to her own jeopardy) yet it's never crossed her mind (over 8 lifetimes and thousands of years!) that forcing herself on an unwilling host - basically erasing them from existence - is NOT ok??? This makes no sense, and the explanation we are given (that the souls make the world better than the hosts did) is not sufficient. 
 The last 200 pages or so I couldn't put the book down - I was fully invested in both romantic relationships and fascinated by the tangled connections each character had with the others (and more than a little nervous about HOW they could all possibly get an HEA). I kinda hate S.M. for making me cry over a worm (When Stolen by Lucy Christopher made me cry over a Camel I thought that was as bad as it could get - LOL) but the end was *almost* perfect (view spoiler)[ I just WISHED we could have seen the reunion between Melanie and Jared!!! Seriously - THAT is what I wanted the entire book, and we didn't get to SEE it??? ARGH!!! (hide spoiler)] and overall I liked the book - I just didn't love it."
0,"DNF, so no rating. I just can't get into this one, and I've loved David Levithan in the past. I think the insta-friendship thing just isn't working for me. I also think I'm too old to fully get behind the drama-filled friendships and loves of high school. Our two main characters are in love with people but there's some overblown drama surrounding it, and then they don't want to tell their friends things, and there's jealousy with this overnight fame, etc. I honestly think I'd eat this up if I were young, but I'm not."
5,"I knew it. I just know things are never simple with Colleen Hoover's books. All this time I was holding my breath and waiting, just waiting for the impending doom that I know in my gut that is sure to come. 
 When that awful moment came, that mere 15 seconds which changes everything, I feel my heart shatters along with it - the broken glass, the fragile truth. No,no,no,no,no. Head shaking in disbelief, mouth gaping open in shocked horror and stunned silence at the horrific realisation with Ryle, seemingly perfect gorgeous Ryle or so we thought. What he did, I can't...it was just immediate shut-down, guards up, unacceptable in my perception, anyone's perception, especially in Lily's circumstances. It is sad, so sad how a beautiful relationship can be ruined in an instant. But I am glad Lily, brave and bold she is, made the right decision when it matters. 
 And then Atlas came. No, Atlas was always there - past or present, physically or emotionally, in Lily's heart, mind, consciousness, soul - he was always there really. Kind, gentle, protective, understanding, lovely Atlas. Gosh I LOVE him so much!! (Can we also just appreciate his downright beautiful and unique name *sigh* <3) His relationship and connection with Lily is so precious and genuine and deep. I really like Colleen's approach - via Lily's truthful journals to Ellen - where she touched on Atlas and Lily's past which was heart-breaking yet tragically beautiful at the same time. They are each others' salvation. 
 ""It stops here. With me and you. It ends with us."" Yes, it ends with them. Such brave decision with great sacrifice and pain by Lily but all worthy in the end. 
 ""You can stop swimming now, Lily. We finally reached the shore."" Such a beautiful and touching ending. Yes, it ends with them. I can see now it's always meant to be. 
 'It Ends with Us' - a simple title at first glance but in actuality layered with so many profound meanings and deeply attached emotions."

 Any Duchess Will Do by Tessa Dare 
 Book Four of the Spindle Cove series 
 Publisher: Avon 
 Publication Date: May 28, 2013 
 Rating: 4 stars 
 Source: eARC from Edelweiss 
 ***Warning: this is an adult book, and for the eyes of mature readers*** 
 Summary (from Goodreads): 
 What's a duke to do, when the girl who's perfectly wrong becomes the woman he can't live without? 
 Griffin York, the Duke of Halford, has no desire to wed this season--or any season--but his diabolical mother abducts him to ""Spinster Cove"" and insists he select a bride from the ladies in residence. Griff decides to teach her a lesson that will end the marriage debate forever. He chooses the serving girl. 
 Overworked and struggling, Pauline Simms doesn't dream about dukes. All she wants is to hang up her barmaid apron and open a bookshop. That dream becomes a possibility when an arrogant, sinfully attractive duke offers her a small fortune for a week's employment. Her duties are simple: submit to his mother's ""duchess training""... and fail miserably. 
 But in London, Pauline isn't a miserable failure. She's a brave, quick-witted, beguiling failure--a woman who ignites Griff's desire and soothes the darkness in his soul. Keeping Pauline by his side won't be easy. Even if Society could accept a serving girl duchess--can a roguish duke convince a serving girl to trust him with her heart? 
 What I Liked: 
 Before I start, let me just say that I have not read the previous Spindle Cove novels or novellas, except Beauty and the Blacksmith (Book 3.5). 
 I liked this historical romance novel! I tend to like most of the ones I read, because I am extremely selective with these. Eventually, they can just start to sound the same. So I try to limit the ones that I read, and only read the ones that sound somewhat unique, or the ones that are by authors with which I am familiar. 
 Griffin is not your typical duke, or high-ranked member of society. He suffered a great deal about a year before our story starts, and this plagues him throughout the story. As readers, we don't see understand what it is until very late in the story, which is fantastic, because usually I can figure things out pretty quickly. Not so with Griffin. 
 It's always good to like your alpha males, right? Griffin is an awesome hero of the story, and I really liked following his train of thought. He was a lot more interesting than Pauline (sorry, Pauline!). And he is definitely a charmer, when he wants to be. 
 Pauline is a heroine with a good deal of depth. I liked this about her, because it really straightened out Griffin's mother at times. Pauline did her best to understand Griffin, and empathize, and work with him and for him. She has a kind heart, but she is a also a strong woman. 
 I love that Ms. Dare included Daniella, a ""simple"" (autism-like condition). It made the women of Spindle Cove seem awful, compared to Pauline (not that Pauline is anything like them), and it made Pauline all the more likable. 
 Griffin and Pauline together. BOOM. Their relationship is so sweet, and yet, they can make it rain. I love the scene in the library, but not just for naughty reasons. Same with the one at the orphanage. There is where we get a peak at Griffin's past. And it's there that we see Griffin and Pauline hold up each other. 
 The plot was very Cinderella-esque. I know you might think, oh, then I know exactly what will happen! Well, not really. Because what you think will happen did not happen. 
 The ending was good. Ish. Keep reading below - you will see why I am ""eh"" about the ending. But, there was no love triangle, no major plot holes, nothing that made me mad. This book was truly a good one! 
 What I Did Not Like: 
 Like I said before, I thought the ending was good. Ish. It wasn't your traditional, perfect ending, but I am glad everything still went well for Griffin and Pauline. I just cannot understand Pauline sometimes. 
 Would I Recommend It: 
 Despite the slight discomfort with the ending, I enjoyed this book! It's definitely a fantastic historical romance book, and I think most historical romance fans will love this book. DEFINITELY read this one if you love the Spindle Cove series and Tessa Dare! 
 Rating: 
 4 stars. Go read it! You will enjoy this cute and humorous historical romance novel."
3,"This was a fun, quick, sexy read, but I would've liked to have seen more relationship development before Gage and Marina found themselves in love. So ready for the next book in the series!"
5,"This series hits my favorites list. Sadly this is the only book that's in print right now so I'm going to be driven nuts for awhile while I wait for the next one. 
 There have been tons of series of books about kids having adventures though the ages, but this one is unique in a few areas. First of all, love the history/science/geography connection going with a good smattering of languages along the way. But the fact that the DAD is there, present and a WILLING PARTICIPANT in the adventure makes me really love this book. No scrappy orphans, no running off and doing what they know better than grown-ups, but a grown-up who is an honest grown-up, with worries and desire to see children kept safe in an impossible situation - and then enough trust for those children to do what they need to to save the world. 
 Oh yes, this is a good series."
4,"Sometimes you come across a book that doesn't seem very interesting at the beginning but then grows on you as you read further. For me The Night Circus was just such a book. 
 I really disliked this book starting out. There did not seem to much going on, the characters were uninteresting and paper thin. It took me two attempts to get through the first couple of hours on audible as I fell asleep the first time around. If this had not been a pick for the Sword and Laser bookclub I would most likely have abandoned it. That would have been a great shame as I ended up really loving this book by the end. 
 It's the story of two practitioners of 'real' magic, involved in an obscure contest against one another, who hide their talents by working in a circus. Almost everyone else thinks they are just really good at prestidigitation and illusions and have no idea what is really going on. 
 The book is structured with the chapters jumping between timelines and points of view. At the beginning these are far apart but gradually get closer and closer together until they converge at the end. This made the early parts of the book hard to follow on audible as you cannot refer back to previous chapters to review the dates. 
 After finishing the audible version I went out and bought a hard copy and will re-read it again at some point. 
 Not quite a 5 star book as the beginning was hard to get into. I can see why people might abandon this book after reading the kindle sample. It's lacking that initial 'hook' that grabs you in the first chapter or two."

3,"Pedro Paramo tells the story of Juan Preciado returning to the village of his mother's birth as part of her dying wish. She wants Juan's father, Pedro Paramo, to pay for abandoning his family. What follows is a brilliant journey with echoes of Dante and plenty of magical realism. The narrative is complex; Pedro Paramo is one of those novels that doesn't reveal everything on the first read. The story is interesting, interspersing a number of different viewpoints along with Juan's POV. 
 Those viewpoints, however, are both a good and bad thing: readers who aren't devoting their full attention to this novel will absolutely miss details and important points. Though it's not difficult to read, there are a lot of nuances in the text and POVs change with almost no notice. 
 Very quotable, Pedro Paramo is a great piece of literary fiction."
4,"I was flying home from St. Louis on Southwest Airlines, and they had free wifi. Well, free if you wanted to read a book, that is. I was bored, so I picked this book as one I knew nothing about, but which based on the title looked intriguing. I didn't have time to finish it, but I got about two thirds of the way through before landing, at which time the book vanished. Anticipating this, I noted the title and author and got it out of the library to finish it. 
 This novel made me happy, because I expected nothing from it and instead got a great deal of pleasure. Many books I've read this year have been the opposite: I expected great reads and was disappointed. This was an interesting story with well-written characters and a mystery which I didn't figure out five minutes into the story. Only one thing bothered me. 
 (view spoiler)[There is a fantasy element which is kind of an afterthought. I would have liked it if this aspect had been strengthened and made more of an impact on the story and character. Instead, it seemed like a convenient way to enable the situation. (hide spoiler)] 
 If you love stage magic--and I do--this is a very enjoyable read, with an entertaining mystery."
4,"If you have not read Pines and you are thinking of reading this one, just STOP. Go read the first one or you will not know what the heck is going on. 
 This book was a great example of what a sequel can really be like. It starts right where Pines leaves off and with the characters in the same mindset. Ethan has accepted the sheriff's position to understand the inner workings of Wayward Pines. We get introduced to other characters that have similar feelings to Ethan and we learn more about what's going on with Ethan's wife. It leaves off on a bit of a cliffhanger, but I'm looking forward to reading the next in the series. 
 I listened to the audio version and Paul Michael Garcia does a great job of portraying the emotional turmoil of each character and the determination of Ethan."

 Review 
 Firstly, I want to say that this is a novel to be thoroughly enjoyed. Strap yourself in, sit back and enjoy the ride. It's fast, it's got highs, it's got lows and when it's over, you'll be thankful for the ride... and that's pretty much it. 
 City of Bones is a guilty pleasure. Both for the reader (especially if the reader is a fan of fantasy books, television shows and movies - like myself) and the writer. Quite frankly, it's not the best or the most original piece of work, but I'm glad I read it and have it sitting on my book shelf. 
 While reading City of Bones, I found myself likening bits and pieces, elements and character, etc. to other books, shows and films. At first, I found it slightly annoying. But I stopped thinking too much on it, and simply paid attention to the story instead. In a way, City of Bones is to me, a big mash up homage to Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Buffy the Vampire, etc. And that thought makes me sad because Cassandra Clare DOES have a good story line here... 
 On the other hand, readers may find it fun to spot things that mirror Clare's fan fiction. But while things like a 'Still Not King Yet' badge did make me smile, it also distracted me from the story. This, in the long run, isn't a good thing. I want to stay immersed within the drama of the characters, rather than send a nod to the author. 
 And speaking of the characters, while the banter is fun and made me laugh out loud (some memorable one liners), the characters themselves didn't seem very consistent to me, contradicting their very own nature. And I wanted to smack them around for their obliviousness at times. They are thoroughly flawed and while this should make them more 'real' the flaws seem very contrived. On a side note, I'm getting sick of heroines who are 'beautiful' but they don't know it as they are shy and not very confident, while having to rise to the occasion and do great things all the while falling in love with the guy she can't/shouldn't have. 
 All in all, however, I will at some stage love to re-read the series. And while I have nit-picked in this review, it's simply because though I don't have many issues with this novel (I did really enjoy it and have a great respect for the world that Cassandra Claire has created), the issues I do have are glaring and very obvious. I have to make my self ignore things and not think about it the narrative flaws, and I really wish I didn't have to. I would have loved this novel all that more."
3,"3.5 
 Not my favorite of hers, but still pretty good. This was a bit darker and sadder in feel than some of the others. But her couples are always so good."
3,"First off, I didn't like the allusions to all Jacob's lovers. And the fairies were odd, quite unique, but I can't decide if it was in a good way or bad way. 
 The plot was good. I was annoyed at how the good guys always seemed to be failing at everything, playing catch up with the bad guys. The pace was good, back story well explained. 
 I really liked the ideas of the goyle! They were interesting creatures, though I was disappointed that you lost your mind if you lost your skin. Why? 
 Actually, there were quite a fee things unexplained in the book, I felt. It was more of a feeling than anything, though. Usually there's more intro time to a book, and this book seemed to start a quarter way into the story, leaving much to be guessed at. How many kingdoms are there? How mig is the mirrorworld? What are all the creatures that can be found there? Why do the fairies do what they do? What do normal people do? Have others from earth visited that world? How old is Jacob? (24?)"
3,"Wow, a dozen so far and still pretty good and funny. Ms Evanovich needs to let Stephanie smarten up and quit making the same stupid mistakes over and over. She is giving us women a bad name and stereotype. It has gotten tiring. And what about Joe and Ranger?? Stephanie needs to get Ranger or Joe out of her system and decide who she really wants."
4,"Veronica Roth, you did me dirty with Divergent. I was super hesitant to read this book. But then when people kept asking me, ""How is it?"" I could only, tentatively, hesitantly, surprisingly respond with, ""It's... really good?"" 
 I'm calling us even, for now."
2,"2 Stars...and I'm being generous... 
 I LOVED Tangled. I loved Drew and Kate was pretty okay,too. I also really liked Holy Friggin' Matrimony. So you can imagine that I was pretty stoked to give Twisted a whirl. I started it, all excited but then... 
 This book is like one big Three's Company episode. Except not funny. The big misunderstanding is beyond stupid and fury inducing. 
 At first I was like: 
 Then I was all: 
 And by the end: 
 The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because Emma Chase's voice is entertaining and if this were a book about another couple I might have actually given this a 3. But I'm really having a hard time being that generous. Because she ruined Drew and Kate for me. Straight up 
 RUINED. 
 I hate them both now and don't care to continue on with this series. I might never, ever give Tangled a re-read, either. 
 Look, when authors go for the big misunderstanding and then proceed to go for hundreds of pages with no one actually saying anything to anyone about reality, then it becomes ridiculous. If this story had to be told, maybe it should have been a novella. No, scratch that. This was a full-on mistake. 
 And that cover? The one that depicts a Drew-type stud lounging moodily on the bed? That's a gross misrepresentation of this book. Drew is absent from this book for a HUGE chunk. Not only is this heroine POV, but he's just not a player in this story for the majority. To make up for this, there's a very large Drew-POV epilogue. But by then I was done. Sick of it. Hated all of them and didn't care how the near-future played out, even if it were told in Drew's irreverent voice. Too little, too late, I guess."
3,"I received an ARC of this book in exchange for my unbiased review. 
 Leaving Amarillo is the name of Dixie Lark, Dallas Lark, and Gavin Garrison's band. The three have been best friends ever since Dixie and Dallas had to move in with their grandparents after their parents died. Leaving Amarillo has gotten a shot in the Austin MusicFest, where they hope to get noticed and eventually sign with a record label. However, Dixie has always been in love with Gavin, who promised Dallas he would never lay a hand on her, and she doesn't know if she can control herself enough to focus on the music instead of Gavin. 
 Casey Quinn definitely has a talent for words. The romance scenes were too over-the-top for me; they felt like someone was transcribing what they saw on a porn video rather than anything grounded in reality, but if you are looking for some escapism in that area, you might enjoy it. I did like the parts about the band and would be curious to see how they turn out."
4,"There was a period of several years in which I was convinced I had not read this book, that in fact it was the last David Mitchell book I hadn't read and that I was saving it for tough literary times, times when it seems like every tale has been told, when all reading feels like re-reading, when magic is gone from the world. I eventually got tired of waiting for these times to arrive, read the first chapter, and realized I'd already read it. When the Big One hits my beloved Bay Area, I'm going to check my earthquake kit and realize I've pilfered all the food for camping. I am my own nemesis. (Actually, now that I'm re-reading my review of ghostwritten I think that was the book I was saving. Maybe publicly shaming myself will improve my memory) 
 More recently, though, a friend used her magical powers of conversation to reveal that I remembered nothing about this book aside from a grisly bowling scene and Goatwriter. With that wind blowing into the low pressure system of severe fiction withdrawal left behind the Cloud Atlas movie and The Man in the High Castle, my forecast was a 95% chance of rereading this book. Turns out my earlier instinct toward hoarding it was well-founded (most likely upon my subconscious knowledge of its quality): it's great. Even re-reading it is great. Even the parts that don't involve bowling and goat people. 
 Each chapter in this book has a sub-narrative in the form of something Eiji (the protagonist) is imagining, reading, dreaming, or recalling. Now I feel like I squandered my ""yo dawg"" reference in my review of Man in the High Castle, which only has one story-in-a-story to this book's 8 (minimum), but this trope / device / structure / whatever is so common it has its own (wonderful) Wikipedia page, so maybe it's not even worth mentioning. Mitchell does seem particularly obsessed with / good at it, though, and one has to wonder what, if any, purpose it serves. In Cloud Atlas it drives home the notion of interconnection underlying the whole book, but in number9dream... I'm not really sure. Eiji's PanOpticon fantasies and his memories of Anju have direct relevance to the main storyline, but I'm failing to connect the Goatwriter and Kaiten texts with the main narrative, thematically or otherwise, even though they were probably my favorites. Did I mention Eiji actually reads Man in the High Castle at one point? Just thought I'd throw that out there. 
 I guess I want this to be a book of ideas like ghostwritten, Cloud Atlas, and Jacob de Zoet, but I think it's mostly pure allusion and impression, not unlike what little I've read of Murakami's work, to which this book bears some resemblance (of course, Eiji also reads Wind-up Bird). 
 (view spoiler)[There is a great deal of moral clarity, which seems to run through all of Mitchell's books. Eiji? Ai? Buntaro? The weird pizza delivery boy with the lip spike? Good guys. Yakuza, organ harvesters: unambiguous bad guys. Daimon and Sugu are sort of gray at first but both seem ok by the end. (hide spoiler)] 
 Language, character, all wonderful. 
 Running out. 
 Of steam. 
 Apparently.

4,"I enjoyed this story. I couldn't find a good place to put it down so I read it almost straight through and stayed up until 3am and then slept 3.5 hours before picking it back up. Until the Sun Falls From the Sky was a paranormal romance about a vampire, Lucien, and his mortal concubine, Leah. The thing that bothered me most about this story was that Leah is supposed to be 40 years old. Besides having her age mentioned a few times, there is no indication of her actually being that old. She behaves around 23-25 years old and the most I could let slide would be for her to be 30. It's really strange and very obvious that she doesn't fit her age. 
 Lucien and Leah made a good pair when Leah was able to get beyond her immaturity, assumptions, and overall mistrust of Lucien's feelings toward her and their arrangement. I like Lucien more than Leah. I also really like the secondary characters; especially Stephanie, Cosmo, Avery, and Edwina. 
 Overall, I give Until the Sun Falls From the Sky 4 stars."
1,"To be fair, this book is not bad. I had to read it for a book discussion, and it is simply not my kind of book. I try to avoid horror at all costs, and I just didn't enjoy the story at all personally. I rate books on goodreads by my own system of pleasure, not for objective quality. So while others will love this book, and think it is wonderful, I did not."
4,"This book reminded me why I love Dystopian novels so much. 
 They offer us a totally new perspective on life on earth, in this case post-apocalyptic life. And most often they tell an uplifting story of courage under oppression and happiness and love against all odds. That's what I really enjoy and that's also what Mr. Estes is offering in his wonderful first book in the Dwellers series. 
 Humans have been living under earth's destroyed surface since almost 500 years, and they have never again seen the sun, moon and stars. This has utterly changed society as we knew it. The sun dwellers reign the human world, led by their President in a monarchal position. The moon dwellers, mostly miners, live in an area far below them, a system of gigantic caves linking chapters and subchapters. Here, Adele and her family try to lead a normal life until it is destroyed by the Enforcers who put her into prison and her sister into an orphanage for the reason of treason, of which she knows nothing. 
 The plot focuses on the moon dwellers and their level of the caves which does make sense concerning the title. I wish I could have read a bit more about their life in the caves, more about the background of the system humans have developed in order to survive. But that's just me, crazy info-dump lover (in a proper amount that is). There's a lot of action and fighting in the book. When there are too detailed description of fighting scenes I tend to let my mind wander to other, more exciting things, but here it was really nail-biting action that kept me glued to the pages (or screen of my Kindle). 
 Adele is a great heroine, really truly wonderful! She can kick ass big times with her fighting skills but also has a lot of insecurities. She's not much of a social person and doesn't have a single friend in the world after having lost her family. I don't quite understood why she didn't have friends before the Pen but maybe I missed something there. I'm a quick reader so that does happen from time to time. She considers herself a sarcastic person, but when she meets Tawny and especially Cole she has to admit to being ""outsarcastified"". But her interior comments had me laughing out loud a few times. Tawny and Cole were a bit one-dimensional next to her. There were just a few traits mentioned over and over again to make sure we get them, as for example Tawny not wanting to be like her parents at all. I couldn't tell you much more about her right now, but I hopefully will get to know more about her in the next installment. But there is this really intense little moment when the author describes Adele's first impression of looking into Cole's eyes. Wow, he really knows how to write! 
 And then there is Tristan, oh my gosh! I think I'm in love with him. He's NOT the bad boy, what a huge relief! He is kind and considerate, a bad-ass fighter but doesn't kill when he doesn't have to. Not for one single moment does he wonder about Adele being weak because she is a girl or why she has this impressive fighting style. She's just strong and brave and Tristan respects that. He never wavers in his decision to leave his world behind to get find her what I truly admire. His friendship with Roc is so funny and emotional at the same time, I wish I had a friend like that!! The romance between Tristan and Adele is only starting to bloom, even though they have a weird and rather painful (yes I said painful!!) instant attraction. But still, there was no romantic interaction between them and I could still feel it. I was so excited when they finally met and talked that I couldn't stop reading even though it was the middle of the night. 
 Now on to the tiny criticism: Sometimes, I had some problems understanding the plot. Why do Tawny and Cole leave without hesitating with Adele on this dangerous journey which might come with severe consequences? They've only known each other for two days. 
 Another example: how can a parent let his child go on a life-threatening mission also without any reservation? Being a parent myself it's hard to imagine how people can value what has to be done higher than the safety and even the life of their own child. 
 So due to these puzzling moments, when I had to stop reading and think stuff through, and also because there was this tiny un-nameable something missing, I just couldn't yet give 5 stars to the book. BUT... I've read the reviews on the two following novels already and they are so glorious that I'm sure I will be blown away by Star Dwellers which I will read ASAP."

 Graham 
 This was a really cute and light read. Dramatics were low and there was a hint of a humor factor. 
 I found myself really liking Kennedy, the heroine. She was quirky, blunt, and has a quick and sharp tongue. She has a crush on her year-long roommate who also has a thing for her; but neither one of them know how to express these feelings, so roommates they are. 
 Until Graham's brother, Blake, comes into town and needs a place to stay. Enter: roommate #3. 
 Blake shows his obvious attraction to Kennedy. He's the brooding bad-boy brother who goes after what he wants. And he wants Kennedy. The two start hanging out a little more often while Graham is on the sidelines watching his girl get woo'd by the little brother. So Graham decides to finally step in and let his feelings be known. 
 What's better than two hot brothers fighting over a chick, right? 
 I will definitely look into more books by this author!"

 First, I'll say it again - I LOVE these covers! <3 
 I just re-read Hourglass, and I loved it even more the second time, so I was really excited to read Timepiece. When I said in my review of Hourglass that I hoped to see more of both Kaleb and Lily in book 2 I had no idea that Timepiece is written in Kaleb's POV...and that Lily is the FMC. I really enjoyed Kaleb as a narrator, and I loved seeing their romance develop, but I have to say I was disappointed with how little there was about Emerson and Michael! I wanted to see their relationship grow and change, but they were really just background characters in this one. :-( 
 That said I really enjoyed the book. The plot is not as tight as in book 1, and I hated the ending (if you can even call that an ending), but I have faith that it will all come together and make more sense in the next book."
3,"This book is part memoir, part travelogue, part self-help book, and part love story. I enjoyed reading it. Although the writing style verges on navel-gazing, it's very honest, and funny in parts. I really enjoyed the Italy part and it rekindled my desire to go back. The India part was drawn out and slow, but meaningful. I liked the Bali section, especially the medicine man. All of her travels are peopled with really interesting characters. I felt the book was insightful and I learned from her experiences. I would recommend it, although you have to be in the right mood for this type of book."

 Rating: 1/2 
 Epic, action-packed and overflowing with feels, I'm not sure why I pushed back reading The Assassin's Blade for so long (4 months-ish). I must've been out of my mind because after having read Crown of Midnight, I do remember telling myself that any book by Sarah J. Maas must be read ASAP. Anyway, if you're reading this and still pondering whether or not to pick up this book already, know that I'm here to convince you to read it. No, not add it to your probably endless TBR list but to actually make you to somehow get a copy and read it. Now. 
 Shall we begin? 
 The Assassin's Blade consists of the 5 Throne of Glass prequel novellas, which are, The Assassin and the Pirate Lord, The Assassin and the Healer, The Assassin and the Desert, The Assassin and the Underworld, and The Assassin and the Empire. Don't even think about asking me to pick a favorite; every single one of the novellas featured such different adventures yet were all equally amazing. However, I am going to give little summaries of my feelings regarding each of them. 
 1. The Assassin and the Pirate Lord 
 Pardon me if my memory of this one's a little fuzzy. I had read it earlier this year, before the rest of the novellas. Nonetheless, I do recall getting to catch a glimpse of the real Celaena--the just, generous girl beneath that's untarnished by her violent profession--as she chooses her morals over career. It's also where she first started seeing Sam as a person, not simply another competitor and also begin to question orders given to her. 
 2. The Assassin and the Healer 
 The shortest of the novellas, this one might come off a little more like a filler. However, it made up for its lack of length through the puzzle pieces it had contributed to the world-building. Told from the POV of both Celaena and Yrene (the healer)--who's from Melisande, a part of Erilea that has had little mention in the series so far--this novella will hint at the southern continent. From the sound of it, it seemed like a gorgeous place (or at least better than Adarlan Empire) and hopefully, Celaena's journey might take her there one day too. 
 3. The Assassin and the Desert 
 This one here is undoubtedly the most venturesome of the five. It dictated the time Celaena had spent training with the Silent Assassins in the Red Dessert and boy, was it awesome! Despite the gruesome training, the vast difference of culture in the Red Desert as compared to Adarlan had been wholly fascinating. Moreover, with riveting characters such as Ansel, the Mute Master, and Ilias, there was not a single dull moment. And if you thought Celaena was wild, you definitely have yet to witnessed Ansel in action! 
 4. The Assassin and the Underworld 
 Back to Adarlan now, this was where everything started escalating and the story's intensity increased. This had also been where Celaena begin to consider life apart from Arobynn and the Assassins' Guild. It marked the point where the events leading to her enslavement at Endovier begin. Or well, the more obvious ones, since the avalanche had started growing ever since her actions in the first novella. 
 5. The Assassin and the Empire 
 It was so insanely painful to read this. Especially because I knew what would happened at the end. I'm not even going to hint at it for the sake of those who wants to read this prequel before Throne of Glass. Anyway, the heartbreak I had felt in this novella rivaled that of Crown of Midnight. But the horror Celaena had suffered only made me all the more admire her ability to remain strong, unafraid, and cheerful through it all. 
 Every one of the novellas had provided much insight into Celaena's past and had introduced us to key people who had influenced her to become the Celaena we knew later on in Throne of Glass. After reading The Assassin's Blade, all those little inconsistencies and oddities--or so they seemed--in Throne of Glass and Crown of Midnight would no longer appear confusing. That, by the way, also makes me extremely tempted to reread both those books before Heir of Fire is released. 
 As for those wondering whether characters from the ""main"" series made an appearance, barely any of them did, with the exception of the King of Adarlan. The rest had only been mentioned in passing and yes, that meant no Chaol nor Dorian. Though, really, that was to be expected. 
 Despite the lack of the Captain of the Guard and Crown Prince of Adarlan, the characters in the various novellas, who had all been incredibly colorful and memorable, completely made up for it. Each had their own intricate past and so much personality--both good and bad--that I really hope they would make an appearance again somewhere in the next four Throne of Glass novels. 
 Ultimately, The Assassin's Blade strengthened the hold Celaena had on my heart. Through all her trials and hardships, she never broke and always came out not scarless, but still smiling. And if the day comes where something truly breaks Celaena, Sarah J. Maas may as well rip my heart out already. But back to the present for now. In my opinion, the most valuable thing I took away from The Assassin's Blade had been how unselfishly Celaena loves. Yes, I'm utterly aware she's insanely selfish most of the time but when it comes to the times that count, she never fails to put those she loves first and herself last. 
 No matter how selfish Celaena is on the surface, when she loves, she loves--in every respect--selflessly."

I DON'T EVEN HAVE THE STRENGTH TO CRY LORD HELP ME. *sobs uncontrollably* Thank you, Veronica Roth, for this amazing trilogy even though you just broke my heart into a million pieces."

 Cal/Calliope is a hermaphrodite; that is, born with both male and female parts. No one noticed the hidden boy parts until ""Callie"" was 14, however, so she was raised a girl. We know near the start of the book, that - as an adult - Cal is male. The book tells Cal's story, growing up, as well as the story of his parents and grandparents, who originally came to the U.S. from Greece via Turkey. 
 Ok, so I didn't realize so much of the book was about Cal's parents and grandparents, so for a while from the start of the book, I kept wondering when we'd get past the background and get to Cal's story. Wasn't as interested, initially. But, when I realized that was meant to be a good portion of the book, I let myself ""enjoy"" it more. However, there is one BIG thing that I just can't get past (not mentioned in the blurb on the back of the book, so I assume to mention it here would be a spoiler), that is preventing me from giving it 4 stars. I just can't (ew! ew! ew!). Cal's story, though, I did find very interesting once we finally got to it. Really enjoyed that part of the book."
5,"I am an Alice in Wonderland obsessive. I am also a dark fairytale fan. Add these two together and you get Alice - a dystopian retelling of Lewis Carroll's titular heroine's journey into madness. 
 Alice and Hatcher are patients in a mental asylum. Each have disturbing dreams and shrouded pasts (Alice's not least clouded by the drugs forced on her by the attendants). All they have in the world is each other. Then, one day, the chance to escape occurs. And the adventure to slay the Jabberwocky, whose dark thoughts have been tormenting Hatcher all the years Alice has known him, begins. 
 I took a couple of pages to get into this, but once I was in it was a done deal. This is DARK. There is rape, murder, mutilation, animal cruelty, abuse, psychological trauma...you name it, Christina Henry writes it. I don't think anyone with trigger warnings would get past the blurb, but just in case - this could definitely trigger people. However I didn't feel that Henry was writing any of this for wide eyes and gasps. Her words are in turn monstrous and heartbreaking. There is a particularly strong note regarding the abuse of women in this book - something which I think Henry could perhaps expand upon in sequels. I would love to see the Caterpillar, the Rabbit and the Walrus's former female victims become strong characters in their own rights. 
 Alice really grows throughout the book, finding the strength to face the men who abused her and helping others do the same. She begins as a nervous girl, trapped by enforced druggings and the four walls of her cell. Towards the climax Alice finds her strength is not just in her own vengeance, but in the aiding of others. It's an inspiring message and I felt that whilst women got a really tough deal in this book, it wasn't done gratuitously. Everything Alice suffered helped her become a strong, compassionate heroine. 
 One male character I couldn't get enough of was Cheshire. Manipulative, magical and sporting that infamous wide grin - he's a mystery wrapped within an enigma. I am really hoping for some more of him in Henry's next installment in the Alice series, Red Queen: The Chronicles of Alice. 
 Hatcher, however, I feel could do with work. In fact he was almost the reason that I gave this book four stars instead of five. I really liked his and Alice's relationship - the reality of consent and respect meaning more to Alice than any physical affection was really moving - but the overwhelming madness clouded any hope of substantial character development. I would like to see the next book expand on who he is, as opposed to what he is (and from reading Red Queen's synopsis, I think it definitely will). However it was a small gripe, with the overall far and away surpassing any niggling reservations I held. 
 In conclusion, a truly dark and riveting read set in a terrifying world of magic. I for one cannot wait to go down the rabbit hole again in July 2016!"

 So far it's supremely boring. I actually picked up a Sidney Sheldon to cheat on Gray Mountain, and finished it!"
5,"Not sure why I waited so long to get to this book but when I finally did I enjoyed the hell out of it! 
 Great first book to a fantasy trilogy and highly recommended to fans of epic fantasy."
4,"I have to admit I was a little nervous when I picked this book up, it has a lot of mixed ratings amongst my friends so I knew it was going to be one of those books that I'd either love or hate but the cover made me buy it anyway and now, having read it, I have absolutely no regrets. Right from the very first page I was drawn into the world that Renee Ahdieh has created and her writing is absolutely beautiful. She paints such a vivid picture of Khorasan that it's almost more like watching a movie than reading a book and I was enjoying the story so much that I'd ordered the sequel before I even hit the halfway point. 
 I loved Shahrzad's character in the beginning, the way she was so bravely determined to be chosen as the Caliph's next bride so that she could turn the tables on him and kill him before he could kill her and the fact that she obviously has the skills to back up her quest. I'll admit things go a little wobbly for her when she arrives at the palace and can't quite bring herself to carry out the deed but you know what? I was so sucked into the story that it really didn't bother me all that much, especially when you start to see that there's much more to Khalid's side of the story than you first suspect. I'm not a fan of insta-love but the way their relationship developed didn't feel too rushed for me, the attraction was there from the beginning but I didn't think feelings started getting involved until they'd started getting to know each other a little better. 
 Add in the fact that I really enjoyed getting to know the side characters and I just found this an incredibly enjoyable story that I ended up devouring really quickly. It's taken me a long time to get around to typing up my review (it's a good job I take notes because I'm ridiculously behind again at the moment) but now that I finally have I'm excited that I'll be able to pick up the short stories and finally read the sequel. The Wrath and the Dawn had a pretty killer cliffhanger so I'm desperate to see what happens next!"
5,"Can't wait to read book 7, although I think might finish this series on audible."
3,"Huuuurm. I was so, so, so excited about this book -- which may be yet another lesson to me about getting too excited and over-hyped. Its concept is brilliant: a wayward school for all the children cast off from portal fantasies, a place for them to recuperate and share their experiences amongst people who understand that loss of magic & the unique pain of being shoved back in the real world where your family doesn't believe you. Basically, this XKCD comic: 
 But its premise is better in concept than in execution; as always, I'm so into McGuire's worldbuilding and her prose is lovely, but something falls short here, somewhere in me just not liking the characters very much at all. 
 First of all, it's too short! I thought it was a full book, but instead it's more like a novella, a murder mystery that was incredibly predictable (because there were so few characters it could've been, which narrows the scope dramatically; the joy in murder mysteries is supposed to be in untangling the whodunit). 
 McGuire has such a great idea about the four axes to categorise portal worlds -- Virtue/Wickedness, and Nonsense/Logic -- but it results in tons of awkward, slightly-clumsy exposition dumps to explain these ideas. And yet I was really frustrated by the fact that orientation didn't come first at the school either, and that people kept flinging around unexplained concepts without filling Nancy in about them. I mean, The Magicians' Brakebills is a school of assholes, and even they still take the time to explain what's going on to their protagonist. The pacing is so rushed, too, with everything feeling like it happens within 3 days of Nancy joining the school. 
 The characters are brief cut-outs with no real depth to them beyond their initial summary. Eleanor West, the headmistress, is supposed to be super-great but whenever something happens, she drifts helplessly on-scene, proclaims vague helpless doomy things, and then dismisses the students to their own devices. She asks the students to do everything action-oriented, while contributing nothing herself. She cries into the arms of one of the teenagers! Like, even Albus Dumbledore, garbage headmaster and manipulator of children, did far more. 
 And mostly, I just can't get over my raging hatred of the character of Sumi, which reallllly dragged down the first half of this book for me. McGuire has a tendency to put these manic pixie dream girls in her stories -- in the Newsflesh series it was Foxy, and in Parasitology it was Tansy, and now it's Sumi. The first time, I was charmed. The second time, I was annoyed at such a blunt repeat of such a specific archetype. Now that it's a third time, and she's Asian to boot, I'm flat-out angry. It makes sense that a girl who grew up in a Nonsense world would be like this, but it just smacked way too much of loony quirky sexy Lolita-esque Asian dream girl~*, and McGuire aiming for a Lewis Carroll-esque foreboding whimsy but failing, because she ain't Carroll. 
 There's some important diversity here (a trans character and an ace character) but I wish it had been handled better for Nancy in particular? It's not at all that I felt like they were token characters -- I thought the parallels worked well for the plot, but the execution of it felt like being hit in the face with a two-by-four, like the story suddenly lapsed into political discussion rather than it being a natural reveal about her. The really short length of the story also fed this, since you have such a rushed, superficial impression of each character. 
 I'm really bummed that I didn't like this one more! It's a better idea than a novella; I wish it had been fleshed out into a full novel to put real meat on its bones. :( 2.5 stars, rounded up because the concept's just so darn good."
2,I'm actually not sure why I read this.
5,"It was certainly not what I was expecting. I probably wouldn't have read it if Rowling didn't write it. It was very bleak, I really liked it though."
5,"This story touched me in so many ways, most importantly because i had/have gone through EXACTLY what Melanie went through... (view spoiler)[being diagnosed with HPV, thinking that i was going to die, going through the colposcopy and the laser surgery and EVERY emotion that Melanie felt, was what i felt as well (except i didn't have some John Boy sexy stud to cheer me up). (hide spoiler)] Kudos to you Magan, for writing about an issue that is so relevant in today's society but also for managing to make this story SEXY AS HELL (all thanks to John Boy *cue lustful panting*)!!!"
4,Great little gem. I love the background explanations and the second look of what happened when Four and Sam invaded the Mogs cave. I didn't realize Nine was that close to dying. I can't remember now if The Power of Six mentions them seeing Five during the invasion.
5,"I thought this one started off kinda slow, but once it started, boy did it go. Damn. I couldn't put it down. I am 1000% torn at the end of this one. Wowza."
4,"4.5 stars This book was good. It was really good. Why didn't I give it five stars? Because I only give five stars out to my absolute favorite books of all time. I must say, I really really love books about psychopaths, and Annie Wilkes is definitely filed under the psychopath category. I could ramble on about everything that I loved about this book, but that's what the other reviews are for. There are some things in King's writing that I'm not all too fond of. First off, he makes all of his main characters authors... OK, moving on. I typically hate his endings. He always feels the need to wrap everything up with a nice little bow. I'm not saying that he leaves the reader with an overly happy or optimistic ending, but he leaves no string dangling. Sometimes it's good to leave the reader thinking. I believe that King had a good chance at an epic ending, but he just had to keep going. People who have read the book, I think you know what I mean. Something else that sometimes bothers me is that he repeats these themes(I don't really know what to call them)throughout the novel that you get kind of sick of by the end. For instance, the ""sweatshop"" or the whole ""Scheherazade"" thing. Honestly I forgot what that last one meant by about the middle of the story. Also, something else that I've noticed in his books is that he doesn't really add as much action as you'd like. There's just a lot of internal dialogue. Yes, I know that's part of a good story, but his is so repetitive sometimes. I kind of ranted a bit, but Misery was a very good story that I recommend you all go and read. I will warn the faint of heart, though, it is a bit disturbing."
3,"There are things I enjoyed about this book, and things I just did not like. Overall what do I think about the whole series? I guess we'll get to that. 
 Alright so we finally have the third and final book in the Across the Universe series. 
 Can we talk about how excited I am that I finished it? I mean I suck at finishing series so 
 Were all your questions answered? Yea, they were. Everything came full circle really. I found out the truth about everything. 
 Did you enjoy those answers? Yeah, actually, I did. I think everything turned out really interesting. The world, the aliens, the creatures, the FRX, why Godspeed was there in the first place. What really happened during The Plague, why they never wanted to land. What Orien tried to tell them. It all was finally laid out for us to understand. 
 Did this really wrap it all up into one nice little package? No, not at all. We have all of our answers to the questions from the first two books, we have all of our solutions, but we are missing a whole new thing. After we discover the truth of what inhabits Centuri-Earth we run into the biggest question of them all. What happens now? We don't get to see what happens after the BIG BANG (ha, ha, see what I did there?). We don't get to see how their life continues and what they now struggle with. It leaves it open for honestly, a whole other few books on this planet. Of course that'll never be written, and honestly I'm okay with that. 
 I'd love to see what happens next, but I'm not a huge fan of Revis' writing so I think I'll make up the 'next' part of the story in my own head. 
 So now I'm going to kind of go into all of the books while I review this last and final book of Godspeed. 
 [image error] 
 Where are the pages about the planet, and what new animals and food there is on this planet? How does it differ from Earth besides the trees, one type of flower, and 'wash rag' type leafs? 
 Let's take the juiciest part out of SciFI books, out of this SciFi book, yay. 
 This could have been all in one book. If I really think about it. We could have cut out a lot of crap and just made it one book. I mean if you're going to leave out crucial details and interesting facts, why not? Might as well make it a quick read and stop dragging on the 'mysteries' until Orian gives us another freaking clue. 
 Revis this ain't no blue's clues, this ain't no Scooby and gang looking for clues to get to their freakin SCOOBY SNACKS. 
 I guess the more I think about it the more I am disappointed with this series overall, great idea, okay execution, lack of details and world building. You make me sad. 
 And that romance? 
 WHY WAS IT EVEN THERE? REALLY? It was mentioned very rarely, and when it was mentioned they just stopped randomly, at horrible times and decided to KISS AND OHMYGURD THIS KISS FEELS LIKE BLABLABLA 
 BULLSHIT. 
 It feels like BULLSHIT. 
 Worse pathetic excuse for romance I have ever seen. And I've seem so horrible romance."
5,"Wow. What an intense read. I fell in love with the characters...Chris and Xander, and Chris' family and their friends. I loved the start of the story when they were 14 and how their friendship and relationship progressed...and I got my heart ripped out a couple of times, and then put back together before the end of the story. I love Amy Lane's books, she always delivers fantastic reads with real, flawed, deep characters, so much emotion (and angst!), and I loved every single minute of reading this story. I think this may be my favorite thing from her. A MUST read, highly recommended...you might want to have kleenex handy."
2,"More like 2.75 stars. I can't bring myself to put this at three. 
 After reading Someone Like You I though I was done with Sarah Dessen. For the next year I lived with no regrets as I saw people pick up and devour her books knowing that I wasn't missing out. I never even picked up a book of hers at the bookstore, but that all changed because the bookstores of the small town I'm on vacation in don't have a huge selection of YA books. They did have a small selection of Sarah Dessen books, so seeing no other option I chose the one without the bikini clad girls on it and bought What Happened to Goodbye. 
 The first thirty pages were the best, in my opinion. Knowing the dedication of hardcore sports fans I can't imagine the devastation McLean and her father felt about being cheated on with the coach they so idolized. The writing was plain but conveyed the sadness McLean felt well. But I think the author was so wrapped up in the divorce that she forgot she was supposed to be writing a coming of age story about a girl finding herself. The only time I understood the message of this book was while McLean was talking about her parents divorce. Dave had so much potential but he just kind of awkwardly sat there throughout the entire story and contributed less to the plot than the other friends McLean made. 
 I'm definitely going to pick up another Sarah Dessen book as they are easy to read, look good on my shelf, and are entertaining, but I am still not calling myself a devoted fan just yet."
4,"My ratings are normally based on how compelled I felt to read the story, so this one's a solid 4 star, in that, I found it very hard to put down. 
 The book's got problems though. 
 The characterization was...amateurish? All the characters felt like archetypes; no one brought anything unique to the table. I've seen these types a million times in Y/A and they've been done better. She spread her plot over too many perspectives when I really just wanted Sharzhad's p.o.v. The other one's didn't add a damn thing to the book. 
 The romance was a little bland. I think I was rooting for the wrong guy. I was just so bored by Khalid; despite him being the king of kings who kills all his brides at dawn, he was wholly uninteresting. 
 On a positive note, as far as re-tellings go it was a pretty enjoyable read. It was really well-paced and atmospheric. I felt drawn into the world and all it's little peculiarities. And the end was, well, not really an end. I'm already reading the next one."
3,meh. Where'd Josh go?
4,"A beautiful fable. He took what could have been a trite 'what if?' thought exercise (What if no one died?) and made it a nuanced, magical narrative. He guides the reader through the macro (how the cessation of death would tax the national infrastructure) to the individual, as we meet an unassuming cellist and his dog, who lead death to do something she's never done before..."
4,"This is an absolute 3.5 stars for me. 
 I was conflicted actually, I really liked Isla at the beginning and towards the end, I just couldn't really get her. But I enjoyed the story just because it was a love journey thou kinda fast-paced and felt instalove for me (I could not for the love of God say that have a crush equals to love). In a way this book deals more with insecurities especially on Isla's part, that I could relate. I appreciate the little portion of stories of sisterhood, friendship, and family. The love story was just straight steamy from the start. 
 Every Perkins Books love stories had their own issues and problems that the two destined characters had to deal with and solve. Then they all end happily ever after. 
 If I can choose which one is my fave, it's Lola and the Boy Next Door for me (shocker? haha). But it's true.."
4,"I received this book for free in a Goodreads First Reads Giveaway. 
 As Wendy marries Tove for the good of their kingdom, her feelings for Finn fade as her feelings for Loki, whose fled her father's kingdom seeking amnesty, grow. Wendy has until she is Queen to figure out a way stop her father. Yet while she and the Trylle are safe in Forenking, her father's Vittra attack Oslinna another Trylle city. 
 Wendy eventually manages to give them assistance despite her first attempt ends in disaster. Her marriage with Tove is also a mess, and the night he strikes her after draining his powers attempting to aid Oslinna, Wendy does something equally reckless which may have changed everything.

3,"So I adored this book up until about 90%. Can you guess why? 
 (view spoiler)[I knew who was going to die going into reading Six of Crows. As I read the books I grew to love Matthias more and was dreading the death scene more and more because tt would probably make me cry buckets. However it didn't. In the end I was angry and disappointed. 
 The scene felt rushed and out of place. It was like a last minute addition. Almost as if Leigh was like ""Oh I said I character would die so i'll just put that in here quickly"". 
 I'm not sure if I had to high of expectations for this book or not but wow was this death a cop out. It was purely for shock value and I am so disappointed in Leigh for doing this. I thought she was better than this. 
 It spoiled the rest of the book for me. I couldn't enjoy the other characters endings. It was so lack lustre in the end. 
 I'm still not certain on my 3 star rating for this but i'll leave it for now. Maybe i'll re-read it in the future but for now I never wanna see this book again. (hide spoiler)]"
4,Wowowow! I had so much fun with this!
3,Review will follow in the next couple of days or so..
5,"I really really liked this book. Especially since Bryan got the raw end of the deal in The Mating. I love how Nicky connects all of the books, and there is more in this book than in the first two with werewolf lore. 
 Great book, Great Author."
5,"I've never been particularly squeamish about spiders, but this book with its rivers of undulating carnivorous black spiders rushing down on cities creeped me out enough I had to keep putting it down, assure myself that nothing was crawling on me, and then immediately jump back into it. Special kudos to David Wu and Chelsea McGuckin for the fantastic cover art and jacket--the webs on the cover are all raised, so I was also a little physically uncomfortable reading this book as well--and a book on killer spider apocalypse includes better maps of where the action is happening than most history books. 
 Really, makes me think of World War Z--and I'll say it--I think this book is better than World War Z in many ways. It does the global part of the spider epidemic in a good way--all over the world, there's slight seismic rumblings followed by yes, hordes of spiders pouring out, devouring everything in their path. Even if one slightly brushes up on you it seems like a thousand eggs were just laid in your chest cavity just waiting to burst forth. China. Atlanta. India. Scotland. Minneapolis. Peru. Washington DC. India. Los Angeles. Japan. Some survivalist wet dream town in the desert. All the hotspots. 
 A few quibbles. Why does NO ONE use flamethrowers against the spiders? Why are they fighting them with guns? What is the point of sending in cops or like the one scene where the main cop on the Spider Task Force gives his ex-wife a shotgun to protect herself? Wouldn't a can of aerosol and a lighter be more effective? Why did China continually doubledown on the use of nukes? (view spoiler)[ Gee, when all the spiders up and died after like 3 days, I bet they felt silly. (hide spoiler)] Why aren't the Spider Task Force hunting for kinds of pesticides or the spiders' weakness instead of testing the egg casing and feeding ever increasing numbers of unfortunate rats to them? And as usual once again, OSHA has failed the thriller laboratories' lowly staff. 
 There is a large cast of characters, which gets progressively whittled away through the course of the book (because spiders, lots and lots of spiders). The destruction of LA via spiders was also I thought well done--with millions dying because too busy trying to record the spiders or become famous instead of running the hell away (though the spiders seem to be super fast and can basically fly). I liked that many of the main characters are strong women in leadership positions--both scientists, the president, the Marine platoon leader--however...and I hate this across all thrillers so it's not really a gender thing...but there is a time and place. When cities are being overwhelmed with rampaging hordes and countries are using nuclear weapons to fight insects, perhaps spending your time wondering which of the three men in the room you want to bang more is a precious waste of time? Every single characters has lots of romance angsty thoughts cascading through their brains when as like Washington Chief of Staff, more important shit to be fretting over! 
 Although I groaned aloud every time it veered into ""I just need a man!/I need to feel attractive again!"" territory but in a way, it helped break up the more grisly scenes, and there will be most likely 2-3 more books, if not dozens more (bring it!) with the remaining characters so perhaps all this will be more crucial to the plot than it was now. And it did help humanize all the characters in various ways. Special kudos to the writing which blows most other books of this genre out of the water. The description of the spiders and the horror was top notch and by hopping around to various parts of the globe under siege, a very quick read. 
 Highly recommend--will be checking out anything else by this author."
3,"I like the story, but this book is highly political and highly philosophical. Combined with the dystopian Dark Ages depression ""feel"", I had a hard time getting through it all. It's still a great story, and more of the magic system is uncovered that wasn't explained in the first book of the series, but overall, I felt this book was just flat. The ending wasn't really that spectacular, like is typically Sanderson. Overall, for me, it was just ""okay""."
2,I am giving this two starts because of the cliff hanger ending and the lack of a sequel. The story was actually good and interesting.
5,"Review to come! 
 Update 1/8/16: 
 See more reviews on my blog Novels and Necklaces 
 Actual rating: 4.5 stars 
 I have never read a book by Elle Kennedy, but I'm definitely going to check out her other books now! I absolutely LOVED this novel, and I can't wait to check out the rest of the series. While it's a predictable NA story, you can't help but fall in love with Garrett and Hannah. Elle Kennedy had me hooked from the first chapter, and I knew I was in deep with these characters. Plus, this book features hockey, which is my favorite sport, so this was a major win on all sides. I honestly couldn't get enough of the story, and Ms. Kennedy had me busting out laughing so many times. I actually had to put the book down because I was laughing so much at some of the exchanges between Garrett and Hannah. Suffice to say, you definitely need to check this novel out. Just take this for example 
 ""Just out of curiosity,"" she says, ""after you wake up in the morning, do you admire yourself in the mirror for one hour or two?"" ""Two,"" I reply cheerfully. ""Do you high five yourself?"" ""Of course not."" I smirk. ""I kiss each of my biceps and then point to the ceiling and thank the big man upstairs for creating such a perfect male specimen."" 
 Garrett and Hannah quickly became one of my all-time favorite couples. The one thing that I truly appreciated was that their relationship felt natural in its progression. They started off basically hating each other, to becoming friends, to becoming something a bit more, until it blossomed into love. They had their share of ups and downs, like a real couple. Hannah and Garrett had a great relationship, and I loved watching it unfold. Their constant bickering made for some hilarious scenes, and you could tell how perfect they are for each other. 
 ""She tries to take a step down the hall, but I tug on her hand and kiss her again, and this time it's not a peck. I kiss her hard, losing myself in her taste and her heat and every damn thing about her. I never expected her. Sometimes people sneak up on you and suddenly you don't know you ever lived without them."" 
 Hannah and Garrett have their own share of skeletons, and I liked how they trusted each other with their pasts. Their pasts involve real issues that aren't usually discussed in novels like this, and I applaud Ms. Kennedy for incorporating these issues into the story. She handled them with an expertise that shows how great of a writer she is. Besides these parts of the story, the story was a lot lighter and more fun than I originally expected, which was a nice surprise. 
 ""How did I go so long without noticing you, damn it? Why did it take seeing a stupid A on your midterm to make me notice?"" 
 He sounds so genuinely upset that I scoot closer and kiss him. ""It doesn't matter. You know me now."" 
 ""I do,"" he says fiercely."" 
 I definitely recommend checking this book out because you'll be swooning (how can you not with someone like Garrett), fanning yourself due to the steamy scenes, and then basically crying because of the emotionally-charged scenes. While the story was predictable, it definitely didn't detract from the awesome book that was The Deal. This is a great college romance novel that will leave you longing to check out the next story! 
 Happy reading :)"
4,"A classic collection of Bradbury short stories. Some of them are dated, but over all they are enjoyable. One other interesting note, is that I've become used to more modern short stories that all seem to have some sort of twist at the ending. Many of these stories did not have such a twist, which turned out to be more surprising to me than most of supposedly clever endings I've read."

 This was my first book by Jade West and not my last (I already own another paperback of hers ;) ). 
 The book is written in a changing point of view of both the main characters. 
 The main characters are: 
 Melissa: A young woman who has to grow up and be mature from one day to another after sth tragic happened to her family. She has to put her dreams and plans on hold and will do everything now to raise her little brother as best as possible. And a job at the firm the man of her dreams, the man she loved since she met him, works at, is part of her plan. The plan: Work hard to get to the top, earn enough money and get the boss to fall in love with you too. But nothing is as easy as it seems and some plans might turn against her. 
 Alexander: He is the boss. A ruthless, feared and very successful lawyer. He's powerful and confident. And he is also a man with special needs. A man who likes it rough. A man who is turned on by some things that others see as a Hard Limit. But behind all that is also a man who isn't happy with his life as it his. A man who is lonely. A kind man who just needs someone who loves him and everything he is and likes. But who would do that? As hopeless as Alexander thinks it is to find someone like that, he will soon find out that it isn't. 
 1 auction, lots of money, lies and Sex- all those will bring those two together. But what happens when it's all over? What happens when the truth will finally be revealed? 
 Well read this book and find out yourself ;) 
 My opinion: 
 First of: The writing was good, although there were a couple mistakes in it. For example: Some sentences began with the words twice like ""He heard he heard"" (That's just an example, I don't remember the exact words). And one chapter had the wrong name on it- it said Melissa, although it was from Alexanders point of view. Also... from the beginning I thought that I read that Melissas brother is 5 years old. I was constantly imagining a 5 year old and then somewhere till /at the end it was mentioned that he's a baby. That confused me. 
 The book was quite big. I wasn't sure at first which book of hers (of the ones I already own) I wanted to read first. Buy Me Sir was at first a no as I wanted some fast read and as I mentioned before, this book is big. Therefore I wouldn't be able to read it in one day and I didn't. But I still picked it because it has a better rating on GR and it sounded good too. Somehow though, I'm a bit disappointed right know. I hoped it would be better :( 
 I wasn't able to connect to the characters. Melissa annoyed the heck out of me. I really wanted to shake some sense into this girl. All her plans were so stupid. She was lying (I hate liers) from the beginning and everything she did was just wrong. Right at the beginning of the book I knew what would happen. I knew that the truth will finally come out and that there would be a fight and yeah. So it was all predictable. And I hate predictable. I was bored the whole time. 
 The prologue- well it basically said what would happen with the two. And then it was just waiting. Waiting and waiting and waiting. And then some more waiting. It took almost half the book until Melissa and Alexander finally (really) met and started their relationship- at first just the sexual activities. 
 Dean, Brutus and Melissas Brother were the best part. 
 Dean tried so hard to get her thinking clearly and to make her confess. He was the one who tried to stop her lying. It didnt work but still- he was the one who at least knew that everything she did was wrong 
 Brutus was awesome. Love how he's protecting his home and dad. And his trust issues make him the more loveable. Everyone has flaws. 
 At times I couldn't understand Alexander. He paid 2 million for a woman he barely knew. Alone 500.000$ for a date and a band barely no one knows! That's rediculous and unbelievable. Also... He's a 43 years old, grown up, confident, powerful man and still he is ashamed of himself? Because of that?! (view spoiler)[ Why would someone who is as old as he is and as confident as he is be ashamed of being bisexual? Of liking to do men? He hates his father so why would he care what he thinks of him doing men. His father was even the one who was the reason for the first time he had sex with a guy- against his will. And why would he care that his ex-wife thinks he's sick? He didn'love her and married her just ""for fun"". I just can't understand this. (hide spoiler)] 
 Some of the sexual activities were hot. I loved how he, when they met first, tested her. In general there were some scenes I think I haven't read or haven't read often in other books- Sexual activities that could be disgusting or uncomfortable for some ppl. Writing about this is def. a plus point. 
 The book got better till the end. The ""incident"" at the end- for me it could have been more focused on and could have been longer and maybe darker. It was just so quick and when I thought it's over, it wasn't. Not sure if I'm happy with that ;) The Epilogue was disappointing. But it's fine. 
 The scene with Dean in the hotel room was slightly funny. 
 All in All: I expected a bit more to be honest. But I can't love all books. As I already said- I will read more books by Jade West and hope I will like them more :)"
4,"The best part of this book is the moral of the story, because it addresses a problem that is very common to children everywhere. I always had terrible nightmares as a child and I very clearly remember what it is like to be afraid of them. Had I had this book back then, I would have enjoyed it immensely, and I can imagine many more children will too. 
 The illustrations are gorgeous as always. I especially liked the color palette in this one, the many dark skies contrasted by the golden sand were very dream-like indeed."
4,"This book opened up with birds going crazy and plunging into the ground (to their deaths) or flying en masse into airplanes causing crashes all over the world. 
 My first thought was what is happening here? 
 As I continued reading, I grew more and more fascinated - and more and more confused. 
 Mysteries, secrets, and conspiracies oh my! 
 This is one book where I couldn't possibly have predicted what was really going on. 
 That makes me adore Malinda Lo. 
 Reese is my favorite kind of main character. As her life is imploding and the world around her seems to be going crazy, she doesn't keep everything to herself (even though the government required her to sign an NDA after her accident). She finds ways to talk to her mom (yes - her mother). She decides - with David - that it's okay to bring her best friend Julian into the loop. She doesn't just suffer in silence and try to fix the world herself. I get so angry with characters who do that! 
 Her mom is actually involved in her life. That never happens in YA! A large chunk of the book is dedicated to Reese discovering that she likes girls (too). Her mom catches her kissing a girl, and there's no drama whatsoever surrounding the scene. LOVE. 
 I do think the ending was wrapped up a little too neatly (in what world would the government release Reese and David simply because of media pressure?) but I'm excited to see what happens next. This story is far from over."
4,"Posted on Powder & Page 
 This is another book that I received from NetGalley, published by Curiosity Quills Press. I admit, I was intrigued by the title of the book and the whole reason I requested it was so I could figure out what a ""Deathsniffer"" was. I found out in short order what that ominous title meant and how it fit into the scope of the story. 
 The story itself was a complex and gruesome murder mystery layered in with Christopher Buckley's personal troubles. You see, Mr. Buckley is the guardian of his younger sister Rosemary, who happens to be a powerful spiritbinder. Spiritbinders (or wizards) are a hot commodity because the foundations of society depend upon them to keep functioning (lighting, plumbing, infrastructure) and binding wizards are becoming extremely rare. Christopher is having a really difficult time because he's broke and Rosemary keeps getting into situations where her rare power is shown to the public. In order to keep them financially afloat, he takes a job as an assistant to the Deathsniffer, Olivia Faraday who is just a little crazy, but also really good at finding murderers. Ms. Faraday gets put on a dreadful case involving a noble family that just keeps getting more and more horrific and complicated as the story goes along. Her bright, eccentric personality and tenacity made Olivia Faraday my favorite out of all the characters. 
 The crime solving part of the book was my favorite part because it was incredibly well done. I had guesses about who committed the crime and their motives behind it, but at the beginning I was very wrong. About halfway through I had another hunch, and in the end I was right about it but I was very surprised about the motive and the exact method of the crime. I was happy to have placed my suspicions correctly, but it was really awesome to have been unaware of so many other factors and have that big surprise at the end. 
 The society and the politics of the story world were both dynamic and magical. The spirits that power so much of the cities were reminiscent of the furies in Jim Butcher's Codex of Alera series. The elemental aspect was a clear parallel, but in most other respects they were vastly different. The society was clearly written in a way that suggested great changed were in the making and the two political factions were creating upheaval. At first, I thought that the politics was unnecessary and used for filler, but as the plot progressed, it became apparent that it was actually there for a reason. 
 All in all, the Deathsniffer's Assistant was a fun and different read that kept me guessing throughout. I would love to see fan art of the characters and the elementals because they were written beautifully and deserve to be made into art."
2,"I waffled back and forth the entire book on whether I liked this or not. One minute I was kind of into it and the next I couldn't care less. I actually really enjoyed the artwork, but the story itself was pretty hit or miss. Aside from a few high points, the majority of the volume was extremely boring. Skinner had a ton of potential as a character and I get what they were going for. However, I thought he was super cheesy at times. The whole candy fixation came off as weird and I couldn't take him seriously when he would randomly shout out stuff like 'where's my candy' in the middle of a fight. 
 I might pick up the next volume if it comes in on overdrive or something. Otherwise though, finishing this series isn't too high on my priorities."
5,"Got up at 4 to read Clockwork Princess all in one go before I have to go out. All done. Tea went cold three times. Heart all in pieces. Used half a bog roll. Puffy face. 
 (view spoiler)[He's alive! My beautiful Jem is alive!! I'm so happy and yet so heartbroken. (hide spoiler)]"
4,"As a whole the book was really good. There are several small situations throughout the book that I didn't think needed to be there, like the absence of lube the first time they have sex. Ouch...I cringed when I read that part! Also, Jack is supposed to be naive and D is the one who has been an assassin for 10 years, yet when they are together they seem to switch places. 
 I did like both main characters. Even though D is an assassin, he is still a human and he slowly blooms for Jack. Also, D's dialect was hard to get used to reading but it suited his character."
5,Another masterfully written book in the Lockwood series. Love it!
4,I can understand why this book is a classic.The psychology of men and women behind the mask(comic crime fighters have never seemed so real)set against the backdrop of the United States in the 50s and 60s. I loved how themes would circle back around and how small details are incorporated into the story.
5,"Absolutely loved, one of my favourite books ever"
3,"Fuck no! That fucking cliffhanger. Fuck! 
 The book is all great and that, but that cliffhanger. Oh no. I want to read more. Now. I should have waited till the second book was released. Oh well. 
 *sighs* 
 But seriously, the book is great. 
 Scott and Rylan and well established characters. They are not your stereotypical romance MCs flaunting in the genre. Rylan is no delicate wallflower, neither he is Mary Sue type. And Scott is definitely not an ""alpha"" male asshole type of guy. Lets just say they are in the grey area, as normal real humans are. 
 I will refrain from commenting further on the book, well because I need the second book to decide. Because despite we have seen the start of them, we are still missing lots of details of the big picture. But so far what I've read is definitely 4 star."
0,"My prediction on this book: 
 I will enjoy it immensely."
4,"Audiobook: 
 I like the narrator. 
 The story itself was captivating with interesting characters. 
 Some stuff was a bit too convinient but still worked."
1,"This book was horrible on so many levels. I don't think I could have gotten through the 42 pages that I did if it hadn't been for the fact that Katie and I were reading it aloud to each other, which was torture in itself as the writing was not suitable for that sort of reading. The short sentences allowed for awkward pauses and by page six I was wondering if the editor to this book had ever set foot in even a middle school english class. I mean, washing your hands does not make you ""Very suspect."" Suspicious, maybe. But never suspect. x_x 
 And the horror doesn't end there, inconsistencies start popping up on page 16 and 18 when the main character's crush is described having both a baggy and clingy shirt in the same scene. And again at page 28 when suddenly the main character has a Diet Coke in her hand. 
 Things get even more messed up when the main character's sweet sixteen party starts, when the author throws about celebrity names like they are going out of style. Making remarks like ""I feel like I've exited the house and stepped into a Selena Gomez movie."" Which is odd considering how Gomez's movies are hardly frilly and pink as the author seems to think considering her description of the main character's mom's decorations. Speaking of which, I was extremely disappointed with the lack of pink tuxes at her party. 
 And all of this happens before chapter five, which is where the plot begins and all of my hope for this being an amusing book is crushed into a million pieces. Chapter Five's five pages include the encounter of her first wish, that is a real life my little pony. The discovery of this little pony was anticlimactic, to say the least. With basically the character discovering the pony, going ""omg. a pink pony. what is he, excuse me - she, doing in my backyard?"" Then going inside and continuing on with her day. 
 It was this that eventually lead to our putting down the book four pages later. I definitely would not recommend this book to anyone, it was poorly written and was executed even worse. 
 Just don't waste your time."
3,"The ending was kind of rushed. Luckily the characters improved as the story unfolded! I'm glad Wendy got her shit together and could put Finn in his place! I would have loved to hear more on Tove though, I heard there's a version of the books where he gets more attention... Now I kind of want to get that one. Tove was SUCH an interesting character! Shame. Ohwell. It was still good."
3,"Interesting read, albeit difficult at times. Third person isn't always this difficult to get into. I feel like the author failed to pull you in completely. Too much distance not enough detail. I can't quite put my finger on it. Also, the ending was ridiculous. Fun, but absolutely ridiculous."
4,"Not enough Simon, but a lot of James Herondale, so I'll take that."
5,"THIS BOOK 
 I JUST 
 I CAN'T EVEN DEAL WITH THIS BOOK. IT IS SO GOOD. 
 I had high expectations because OBVIOUSLY SIX OF CROWS WAS AMAZING AND HOW CAN YOU TOP THAT? but Leigh Bardugo did. 
 The plot managed to keep me on my toes and it was just as gripping as SoC or maybe even more since i know the characters now and love them all. 
 KAZ AND INEJ GIVE ME LIFE those two are too much. 
 WESPER IS EVERYTHING. 
 Nina and her waffles. same nina. same. 
 This book is just pure brilliance- the character development, the plot twists, the DIALOGUE everything is on point. it's completely heartbreaking but also there are some hilarious moments and my heart hurts just thinking about this book and having to say bye to these characters. 
 Inej Ghafa is one of my absolute favourite characters OF ALL TIME. SHE SLAYS. 
 Never EVER doubt Kaz... 
 Jesper is so funny but he also just really needs a hug. 
 Wylan must be protected at all cost. 
 Just give Nina some food and she will be happy 
 Matthias...oh matthias...i love him and his old fashioned ways. 
 HAHA SO ONE OF THE GANG DOES DIE HAHAHA AND LEIGH BARDUGO IS EVIL BECAUSE SHE MADE YOU THINK IT WAS ONE CHARACTER BUT IT WASN'T THEN YOU THINK OH IT COULD BE THAT ONE BECAUSE THIS IS PAINFUL TO READ BUT HAHA NOPE AND THEN BAM...OH... 
 AND THE REACTION FROM EVERYONE ELSE IS JUST TOO MUCH. THEY WERE ALL MEANT TO SURVIVE. 
 idk if i will ever heal from this book tbh and i'm just gonna tell everyone to read Six of Crows and Crooked Kingdom because THEY'RE JUST SO GOOD?! LIKE????????!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Happy Reading but tbh this book will kill you so enjoy your death. 
 p.s 'that's the laugh'- *dead*"
4,"I'd heard that this was a cute little romantic contemporary and that's exactly what it was. After reading 'Since You've Been Gone' I wanted to pick this one up for the Travelling Book Project that I was doing with my friends. Ignoring how cute and gorgeous the actual story was (yes I totally fell for Roger too) in between the chapters there were playlists, photos, receipts and just general keepsakes from their road trip which were amazing. Just like SYBG this was a perfect summer read and I look forward to reading 'Second Chance Summer' which is ready and waiting on my TBR (though I am determined to get to it this summer!)"
2,"I really don't see why people consider this book a masterpiece. Apart from the issues concerning racial discrimination and growing up, there's nothing very impressive about it. Even though the narrative was a bit silly and naive, I could never truly imagine the story being told from a child's point of view. In general, I think this was written by a person who doesn't know children at all. And not to mention how utterly boring and pointless some chapters were. 
 And just when it was just getting interesting, it ended. What a pity. 
 3 stars, only because of the ending. Otherwise I would barely give it 2.5."
3,"More atmospheric than outright scary. Very vivid descriptions of the water and island the two men land on, and how things look different in the dark."
2,"I did not like The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and did not continue to read the other 2 books in the trilogy. Since all the reviews I read linked these two books, I should have skipped this one. There are similarities between the books - the main character is an abused, traumatized young woman who solves a mystery. I did like the setting of this book - I don't often read thrillers set in West Africa, but that was about the only thing I liked. A fast read that kinda read like a video game - lots of action and slaughter. Not sure that I'll be reading the next in the series."
3,"The characters were fairly one-dimensional and not believable as police detectives. The who-dunnit was too straight forward and simple. 
 Both main characters were walking cliches. Especially the straight cop in this dynamic duo was portrayed as so simple and uneducated, that I wonder how he ever made detective. 
 Someone looking for a proper cop story should stay away from this. But if you are looking for a little light reading with some not very deep romance thrown in, it'll be fine. Take it with you to the beach!"
3,Three and a half stars.
3,"""I have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their hearts."" 
 Look, I love a good mystery, a great thriller, one that makes me suspicious of every damn character of the book, one that keeps me on the edge, one that has disturbed characters and interesting female protagonists, but this wasn't that. It was a decent book, but most of the plot was really predictable and at some point, it was painfully obvious what happened. I'm used to Flynn's disturbed characters, they are all so unlikeable, but still Flynn gives them some charm, you're intrigued by them, you're really interested in their story. Hawkins made me dislike all of her characters and I couldn't care less if they got better or died or whatever. Her female characters were formed by the same formula, they all had some issues with being mothers, they felt no regret about hurting another women. There's this character that feels no regret about cheating, she actually feels great about it, because being a mistress is all thrilling and it makes you feel so wanted. Ugh. How can you not realise what an asshole you are? 
 I felt bad for Rachel from time to time because she had nobody and she had serious issues, but she was also very naive and it made me roll my eyes. I never understood why she developed a certain relationship with a character (view spoiler)[ *cough* *cough* Scott (hide spoiler)] , it felt pointless and very strange. 
 I loved the title, but the truth is trains don't have much to do with this book, when I first saw this title, I thought a crime was going to happen on that train or anything like this. But nope, it wasn't anything like that, just a cringe-worthy plot with Rachel and her job and of course, her obssession with Tom. Tom, who was such a faded character, he wasn't interesting, at all. 
 I'm giving it three stars because at some point, I was really caught up into the story and wanted to see what's going to happen next, but it never meet any of my expectations and that's really disappointing."
4,"Wow! 
 I thought I could guess the twist, but then Flynn goes and doubly twists the story! Thrilling read! An interesting look at how media influences criminal investigations nowadays too."
5,"Loved the whole idea of this book. I always prefer fallen angels / angels than vampires.. but in this case, i got the best of both worlds ^_^ now if i could just read Gregori's happily ever after now.... =)"
4,"I really don't want to give to much away with this little review. There are, like, two movies based on this series and I've never watched either of them and for that I am very, very glad because this story was a pleasant surprise. 
 It starts out seeming a bit formulaic: about this kid with special magic powers, who's uber talented and starts going to a magic school. We know from the narrator that eventually he's going to grow up and do something significant, so it really seemed like...I donno...EVERY other fantasy story I've EVER read! 
 (OK that's an exaggeration, but still...) 
 This book is aiming at something different than that: Without being super obnoxious about it, it kinda subverts a lot of the genre's tropes. 
 That being said, this book does seem a bit slow at some parts, even though it's actually a pretty short book. It's told in a kind of episodic fashion and even though there are some adventure bits (like a shipwreck and fight scenes), the focus is more on the personal journey of the character. If I had read this book on page, I probably would have had a harder time with it (due to going into it with the expectations that I did) but cuz I listened to it on audiobook, with a great narrator who set such a great tone for the novel, I could understand what the author was aiming for and it flowed really nicely."
4,"Really enjoyed this read. The characters were well-drawn and pleasantly complex, especially considering the youth of the intended audience. I loved seeing how the characteristics of actual underground dwellers (cockroaches, bats, rats, spiders) were drawn out to become attitudes and motivations of sentient creatures. Collins doesn't shy away from harsh realities (in war, there are casualties), but I did enjoy the hopefulness and general shine on this younger-adult novel (as opposed to The Hunger Games), because that's just the kind of reader I am."
4,"WOW! It was so nice to get lost in Lauren Oliver's writing again. 
 Lauren captured the small town of Carp perfectly. In non-fantasy novels I usually feel like the world building is non-existent because you have a real world setting and can just bank on the readers not needing many details. But for a real world setting, Lauren's world building was incredible. I really felt like I was in this town, it felt so real and true to small town life. 
 The characters all felt fleshed out to me. I really enjoyed Heather's depth. I felt like her entire life was the game of Panic, the issues she was dealing with at home and in her relationships. She had to deal with a lot and I felt she was a winner from the beginning. Like, you don't even need to play this game girl, you are so brave already. I didn't connect with Dodge in quite the same way, but I thought that the side story about his sister was a nice addition. Even Nat, who wasn't a narrator, had a depth to her that I loved. She has OCD (or something, it's never said outright), and you just don't see issues like that approached in a real way in side characters. 
 The plot was entertaining. I enjoyed following along with the game challenges. Some of them pulled me into the pages and made ME panic right along with the characters. I was on edge and holding my breath many times. I was just waiting for everyone to die because the tension was so crazy. 
 And that ending was epic! So much was building and building and building and I was wondering how on earth can you end this story? But the ending was solid and satisfying to me. 
 Several times while reading I was struck by how beautiful some of the phrasing was. And that's what I have always loved about Lauren's writing. I've only read her Delirum series prior to this so I was wondering if her prose would carry over to such a different genre, but it did not disappoint. I just have to share this sample: 
 The challenges were always popular, but this year, many spectators had been staying away. [...] But the word - tigers - was too much to resist. It had its own lift and momentum: it flitted through the woods, stole its way into houses barred up against the heat, spun into the rhythm of fans that cycled in bedrooms across Carp. By afternoon, all the players and ex-players and spectators and bettors and welshers and squealers - everyone who cared even remotely about the game and its outcome - had heard about the tigers of Mansfield Road. 
 Isn't that an amazing visual of how gossip spreads? Sigh. 
 4.5 stars, marking it at 4 since it wasn't a fully fleshed out 5. I just felt like the consequences of these games weren't fully explored, and that could have been a good opportunity to include a deeper message."
5,"I believe this book is going to be included in the list with the new classics. It was amazingly spectacular! 
 Charlie isn't a typical teenage boy. He is called a ""wallflower"" and through the rough times of junior high school, he tries to find his identity in a world that's so different than his own mind. A boy and a girl, with amazing taste in music and many levels of awesomeness, help him spread out his trembling hands to the dreams that wait for him... 
 I really loved this book. It had many special life-quotes, that I'll sure remember for many years to come. It also helped me understand that true beauty and power come from within and it doesn't matter if you're different from the rest of the world, as long as you stay loyal to your heart and dreams. I literally adored Charlie. He was such a cute and smart boy, even though it seemed to me that he cried a little too often for a 16-year-old boy (but I guess what happened in his past couldn't have left him without some flaws). I loved Sam and Patrick too, and throughout the book, I caught myself silently wishing I had friends like them. The story was magical, with many parts that left me think and think and think... 
 Overall, it was brilliant. 5 out of 5 stars definitely. I suggest it to every teenager out there and to young adults and adults of course. It's not only a coming-of-age book, it's so much more. It teaches you valuable life lessons and its writing, though simple throughout the book, hides a special beauty which really captured my heart. A masterpiece that should be read by every reader out there. Go on and begin it, this very moment! :-)"
3,"Like other Albom's books, I enjoyed reading this. It's simple but at the same time heartbreaking. I love how Albom's books are thin but full of inspirational messages. You can just simply read this in one sitting. 
 ""Holding anger is a poison...It eats you from inside...We think that by hating someone we hurt them...But hatred is a curved blade...and the harm we do to others...we also do to ourselves."" 
 The pattern in his books are more or less the same. One character, having to go through this journey, learning about life. Except this one learning everything when he's in heaven. Eddie learned why certain things happened in his life. How everything is connected, and does not just happened."
2,"I don't really know what to say about this one. It was too similar in premise to Girl on the Train for me, and WAY too long. I thought it was almost over and I looked at my Audible app and discovered that I had 3.5 HOURS left. That's just...crazy. I figured out the main twist pretty early, but then we went on a twistapalooza and I just couldn't care. I just wanted it to be over. I can't really recommend it, because there just wasn't much worth noting about it. It's not really an original plot and it doesn't bring anything new to the table. Unless you just like books that drag on and have added twists just to have them. The writing isn't bad, but none of the characters are likable at all."
5,"This ""half"" book (though the length of a normal book) tells the backstory of the Lunar Chronicles' main villain, Queen Levana of Luna. She takes on the persona of Snow White's stepmother, the evil queen, and has surprisingly good reasons behind her madness. I'm sure this history will be invaluable in the next book, Winter, which centers on her stepdaughter."
4,"I honestly wasn't even sure I would like this book, but I ended up being pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it!! 
 For a girl with such a fat ass, I was practically invisible. 
 I think the main thing that made me like this book is that I connected with Bianca on a very deep level. She was like me in so many ways it was scary! I found her very relatable, which led to me developing a connection to her story. As I was reading, I was just like, ""Omg she sounds like me. This is me, in my head."" (She even had the ringtone ""Womanizer"" for a womanizer!) I also love that it's a book about a sexual relationship. That's something you really don't see much in fiction, especially Young Adult, and when you do it's generally viewed in a bad light, or paired with slut-shaming. Bianca and Wes were friends with benefits, but it was perfectly okay. I loved it! There's nothing wrong with sex. It's just sex. Sex is not bad. And yes, it can be an escape. I think that's something that really drew me to this book and made it relatable. Sometimes you do things maybe you shouldn't, but it's okay. And you never know a person's reasons for having sex with someone. I love that this book had a very anti slut-shaming tone and some strong judgement free vibes! 
 I didn't know Vikki that well. I didn't know what her home life was like or anything that personal aside from her boy issues. And standing there in the bathroom, listening as she told me her story, I couldn't help but wonder if she'd been running away from something, too. If I'd been judging her, thinking of her as a slut all this time when, in reality, we were living scarily similar lives. 
 Calling Vikki a slut or a whore was just like calling someone the Duff. It was insulting and hurtful, and it was one of those titles that just fed off of an inner fear every girl must have from time to time. Slut, bitch, prude, tease, ditz. They were all the same. Every girl felt like one of these sexist labels described her at some point. So, maybe, every girl felt like the Duff, too? 
 I do think that maybe the audience for this book should be a little more mature. There is a lot of sexual content - the book is basically about sex - and also a lot of strong language. But I think anyone over the age of like 14 has probably been exposed to that kind of stuff in society, anyway. I just think 12 and 13 might be a little too young for this book, since technically that's still the demographic for YA. 
 ""Most girls find my jokes charming."" 
 ""Those girls must have IQs low enough to trip over."" 
 Despite the fact that I'm not a fan of romance, I thoroughly enjoyed the romance in this one. I loved the slow burn it had going! No instalove here, folks. At first they meant nothing to each other - Bianca even hated Wes - and the more time they spent together, the more attached they became. I loved it! Those are my favorite kind of relationships! 
 I read this book because I wanted to see the movie first, but I read that the movie follows a much different story arc, and that it has nothing to do with sex but focuses more on the high school popularity/mean girl trope. Because of that, I honestly have no desire to see the movie anymore. I enjoyed this story too much to see it changed! 
 Favorite Quotes 
 I freely admit that I hate girls who say they love someone before they've dated them. I don't hide the fact that, in my opinion, love takes years - five to ten at least - to develop, and high school relationships seem incredibly pointless to me. 
 That was her choice. Her life. And it wasn't my place to judge. It was never my place to judge. 
 And as I walked down the hall, I decided that I'd think twice before calling Vikki - or anyone else for that matter - a whore again. Because she was just like me. Just like everyone else. That was something we all had in common. We were all sluts or bitches or prudes or Duffs. 
 I was the Duff. And that was a good thing. Because anyone who didn't feel like the Duff must not have friends. Every girl feels unattractive sometimes. Why had it taken me so long to figure that out? Why had I been stressing over that dumb word for so long when it was so simple? I should be proud to be the Duff. Proud to have great friends who, in their minds, were my Duffs.

5,"This was the best good feeling/sad/ugly cry book I've read in a LONG time. The emotions and relationship between Will and Lou felt very natural, even if the six month time frame felt a little unbelievable for such a quick change. Although, given the situation they were in, a day could probably feel like an eternity."
5,"Y'all. This book made me cry like a flippin baby. I was not ready for this series to end. These six friends/family are my favorite. They are flawed but they are beautiful and real. 
 This was Daisy and Ryke's final book and this book is the end of this gang, except for the epilogue book, and man there was so much that happened. I cannot go into it all. This book probably spanned a good 3 years or so, I'm bad at keeping up with that all. But a lot of shit happens with Ryke and Daisy and I loved them more and more with each passing day. I really cannot say anything more except have some fucking tissues handy because you are going to need them several times. 
 I just have to say thank you to Krista Ritchie, Becca Ritchie for writing such an amazing series. The whole premises of these books could have went into something completely different and something that is so overdone that it doesn't stick with you for long. But you two did something amazing instead. You made a series about a group of people dealing with real issues the way a REAL person would deal with them. You didn't glamorize Lily's sex addiction or Lo's alcohol addiction, instead you told a realistic story about the struggles of these addictions and how it affects everyone involved. You showed us with Connor and Rose that intelligence is sexy and that some people express their love differently. And for those that never thought that could love that they can. You showed us with Ryke and Daisy that age isn't a factor and that it is okay to be happy with who we are and what we look like. Never to let anyone make those choices for us and to never stop doing what makes us happy. What you two have done is written a series that will always stay with me and has a place in my heart. Thank you both so very much."
5,"(This review is only for Vampire Fight Club by Larissa Ione) 
 Shapeshifter Vladlena aka Lena and the daywalker vampire Nathan. 
 Vladlena has lost her brother at an underground supernatural fight club. A very illegal club underneath the dance club, Thirst, where Nathan is working as a manager. Vladlena is working as a nurse at UG and she will most probably die soon because she cannot shift. 
 Vladlena and Nathan will meet when Vladena goes undercover to expose the illegal club and those who killed her brother. 
 Nate has also his own agenda and his own plan of revenge for personal reasons. 
 A short story that takes place in Demonica world. Our favorite Seminus brothers are present as the Vladlena's bosses and lots of the characters from Demonica are doing quick appearances. 
 This story is the first reference about the daywalker vampires."
4,"A very delightful classical novel that even young children can get into. It kind of reminds me of Pollyana in a way; perhaps because it was so easy to read as a young child,but told such an amazing story with such realistic characters. Whenever I read this book as a little girl I could always so easily slip away into the Secret Garden, finding the key burried under that little patch of dirt. This is going to be one of the stories that I will be inevitably reading to my child as a bed time story."
5,"The beginning was rather slow but then it picked up and the final battle was huge. And I mean huge. Lord of the Rings huge. And Kate still kicks butt without being obnoxious. I love how she and Curran dance around each other. I was really happy with this book - but the ending! The last 15 pages or so made me cry. And I mean it literally, tears running down my face and all. I never expected that but yes, it was that sad."
5,I've read this one years ago and I can say - I absolutely adore Lord John :)
3,"Not at all what I was expecting from this book. There was so much more to it. It would be swell if there was a sequel, although I sort of like how this one left things a bit open."
5,"I love, love, love, love, LOVE this book. America is fantastic, Maxon is adorable and the supporting cast is great."
5,"NOT ENOUGH STARS FOR THIS MASTERPIECE 
 ""Let us step into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure."""
4,"Of course I love Jerry Spinelli's writing, but I didn't love this book quite as much as the first Stargirl. There isn't the same mysteriousness about Stargirl because this book is written from her perspective--in a diary/letter format. I think I preferred viewing her complex characteristics from an outside perspective. Also, there was a little too much moping going on. But she still remains one of my favorite literary personalities."
1,"I can't believe how popular this book was, and how popular the series is. The lazy characterization of unlikable, one dimensional characters was almost intolerable, but I choked through it simply for the original plot. It's the kind of book that I would rather just read the Wikipedia plot article on, which I did for the rest of the books in the series. One of the whiniest main characters I've ever encountered - including Harry in The Order of the Phoenix."
5,"Freaking Loved it.....What a great start to a new series, and I cannot wait to read all the other MMA boys books.....My first book by this author too, but it certainly wont be my last!!!!"
4,"Immediate reaction: Really enjoyed this one! great fantasy with characters that I'm very attached to. 
 Originally posted on my blog: www.book-scents.com 
 Here's another fantasy to put on your radar, everyone! This was one that was on my list before I headed to BEA. The premise sounded great and I made it a priority to wait for the drop of it! (It got pretty crazy, but trust me, it was worth it!) 
 Kelsea Glynn has lived in hiding her entire life and now that she's turned 19, her dead Queen mother's guard shows up to take her back to her throne. Her uncle who currently sits on the throne, doesn't want her back. First obstacle: getting to the castle without being assassinated. But what does she do when she gets there? How is she supposed to rule her country? There are many who want to bring her down, especially those in league with the super scary sorceress Queen of Mortmesme, the country bordering the Tearling. 
 Kelsea is one kickass heroine. In the face of everything that happens, she gathers herself and thinks not only politically but with her heart, winning the loyalty of the people of the Tearling as well as that of her personal guard. I loved Kelsea because while she can be a force to be reckoned with, she has a sarcastic, snarky sense of humor and it makes her able to be relatable. And did I mention she loves books? I love it when characters love books. :) 
 I loved the Queen's guard. I always have this love for royal guards or anything like that -- it's the fierce loyalty they always hold or the I'll-save-you-even-if-it-means-my-life type of thing. It makes my heart squeeze whenever I read characters like that. Mace is Captain of the Queen's guard and he is freaking awesome. There's a lot about him I'm dying to know more about but what we do know is that he is loyal to Kelsea to the core and will protect her above all else. And umm, I do not want to be on the wrong side of him in a fight! They don't call him Mace for no reason! 
 Now, I have read books with no romance in it and still loved them. I don't NEED there to be kissing in my books. But I couldn't help it, I desperately wanted a hint of it in this one. I mean, it's not that I'm shipping Kelsea with anyone in particular, but maybe Pen or Fetch?? Could we make that happen?? Fetch is a mysterious thief that has come to her aid... but also waited for her to earn his respect. Pen is an adorable guard of hers. I swear I'm not all about the kissing but I really wanted one haha. However, I still loved it even without the romance -- which is saying something! 
 One thing that kind of threw me off about the book is that it seems set in some medieval time with the possibility of some kind of magic -- but then there are hints at modern medicine and pop culture. Apparently a lot of technology and medicinal knowledge was lost but it wasn't really clear about that so it was just kind of weird when, for instance, a Harry Potter reference came up. I definitely did a double take and was like waiit, what? Because everything else is very medieval - horses, castles, nothing modern. It'll probably be explained more in the next book, and it didn't bother me THAT much. 
 I can't wait for the next installment because there are so many things I want to know! I want to know more about the Queen of Mortmesme and Fetch and the Tearling world! And I'm still holding out hope for romance. Haha. If you like fantasy and strong heroines, you really need to pick this up!!"
2,"This could be a great YA fantasy, but it was too overtly religious for my liking. C.S. Lewis did this better."
4,"A amazingly original and philosophical take on dystopian YA...although really this should not be classified as YA as I think that has prevented many people who would really love this book from picking it up. 
 It's hard to talk about Genesis without giving anything away. I went in not knowing much about it, which was definitely for the best. All you need to know that the book takes place over one students' four hour oral examination in front of a panel known as The Academy. In time and space, this takes place about a hundred years from now,in New Zealand, although the land mass is referred to by its Maori name Aoteraroa. 
 For me, this book was like piecing together an intricate and beautiful puzzle, with gorgeous writing and strong philosophical themes thrown in. For such a short book, each page really packs a punch. I would love to reread this down the track to really appreciate some of the conversations between Art and Adam that I failed to dwell upon this time as I was too eager to find out what happened next. 
 The ending was not a huge surprise (view spoiler)[I had guessed that the end would involve her death in some way (hide spoiler)] however the way everything came together was just genius. 
 Highly recommended for those looking for a compelling and thought provoking read."
5,"Engrossing and delightful, even while being full of sadness. Bod is the best sort of boy, and with the loving protection and guidance of his adoptive family, Bod is able to overcome the tragedy of his early years. 
 Perhaps unsurprisingly, it is the dead who teach Bod how to truly live. 
 As a side note, the romantic in me thinks Coraline and Bod would be perfect for each other. :D"
4,THIS.
4,"I'm really torn about this book. Whimsical at times, yet deals with such sensitive subject matter as an adolescent coming to terms with her sexuality in the most oppressive religious environment. Sometimes Winterson writes like how I would love to be able to write. My 10-year-old copy is peppered with pencil marks around the profound little parts that I love, yet at other parts I struggle to follow her into those strange little tangents that her writing takes. 
 I first read this at 12 or 13, and remember feeling so indignant about the way the protagonist was treated by her family - I was perhaps too young to understand much about evangelism as my then church, and that of my parents, was always fairly liberal when it came to sexuality. (view spoiler)[Although her church family reject her, Jeanette does not reject God, and still feels the need to cultivate her relationship with Him: 
 ""I miss God. I miss the company of someone utterly loyal. I still don't think of God as my betrayer. The servants of God, yes, but servants by their very nature betray. I miss God who was my friend. I don't even know if God exists, but I do know that if God is your emotional role model, very few human relationships will match up to it."" (hide spoiler)] 
 Everyone should read this book at least once. The writing finds its way under your skin in no time at all and each time you revisit the text, you'll take something new away from it."
4,"I feel slightly bereft after finishing the final book in the series; I wasn't ready yet to say goodbye to Saba. While the ending was fitting, I still felt somewhat saddened. The pacing, tone and plot of books 2 and 3 were definitely different to the first book but I still enjoyed them. Moira Young's world building is breath-taking and it was very easy to visualize the world that Saba inhabited. I missed Saba's fiesty lust for life in this one but it fit that her character had become jaded and weary of all the killing/death. I still despised Lugh in this book and the way that Saba pandered to him most of the time annoyed me a little (though it has to be said it's totally believable.)I loved how Saba and Emmi grew closer though and Emmi was very endearing as a character. The plot around the betrayer - was it Lugh? was it Tommo? was very good and suspenseful. I found myself changing my mind several times as to the betrayers identity but nailed it in the end. I also guessed the twist with DeMalo but that was a good plot twist and unexpected. One thing I wish had been resolved was how the heart-stone burned for both Jack and DeMalo - what exactly was that and did DeMalo drug Saba's wine in Book 2? But I guess we just have to figure that our for ourselves. Overall I felt this series was excellent and a must-read."
0,"Unlike DeStefano's previous trilogy, this one just didn't grab me. Maybe it's because the main character is too bland or there's absolutely no explanation into any part of the story over a 150 pages in. The introduction of Judas didn't help. He's literally in the book for a grand total of two pages because it's already obvious he will be a love interest according to the ""feelings"" she gets to being pinned to a tree by him. Not impressed. Maybe I will continue it in the future but when I have limited time, I'm not barreling through mediocre books."
5,"Some books give young girls dreams of ponies, kittens, and visions of eternal love. This book is not one of them. 
 If I were to make a metaphor, this book would be the equivalent of the ice bucket challenge. It offers no platitudes, it is harsh, realistic. It slaps you in the face with reality, a reality that is very rarely pleasant. 
 And it is also one of the best young adult books I have ever read. 
 I first read this book as a young teen, perhaps when I was 13 or 14. The main lesson I learned from it: Life is not fair. Life is hard. Life is harsh. People suffer. Good things do not come to those who wait. Even if you're the best person in the world, life can still slap you in the face, and you can only take what fate has handed you. 
 Even if you strive to be the best child you can be to your parents, they can still show favoritism to your younger sibling, for no reason than the fact that your younger sibling was determined through some undetermined reason to be superior. Parents can and will play favorites, despite your best efforts. 
 Even if your mother works her hands to the bone to support you and your brother, you will secretly love your wastrel, drunkard of a father more, for unfathomable reasons. Because human nature doesn't always make sense, and you can't help who you love. 
 Even if you're committed to common sense, you will have your heart broken. People can and will take advantage of you, no matter how much you try to guard yourself. 
 This book is a bleak one. It is about a young girl named Frannie, a child born of desperately poor parents. A quiet child, a shy child, one who takes comfort in books. I think we can all relate to that. A girl mature beyond her years, due to the hardships of the poor Brooklyn life in which she grew up, but a girl who is naive, all the same. 
 She knew her family was poor, but little children never notice much of that. Her mother has to stretch a loaf of bread over an entire week, but there is magic in how she does it so that there is variety in their meals. She takes joy in playing with her brother, in getting a few pennies to buy a bit of candy at the dime store. In buying a pickle and reveling in the sourness of it. Simple joys that only children know. It is not until later in life that reality becomes all too clear. 
 Her neighbors are vibrant, colorful. Above all, they are people. They are human. This may be a silly thing to note, but not all books are about people, not all books have humans that seem human. Too many books have characters who are little more than typescript on a page. The people in this book seem alive, from the grumpy old man who yells at her down the street, to the sadly tragic woman who enters into a costume competition---and wins---for wearing what judges feel to be a symbolic dress with just one arm, not realizing that she is too poor to afford both sleeves, and the one arm is from a salvaged outfit. 
 If you wanted a true portrait of the people of Brooklyn in the early 20th century, you will find no better depiction in this book. 
 No, this book doesn't offer any rainbows, there are no daydreams. Not all little girls need constant beauty and joy and complacency. All girls, however, need a good dose of reality. They need to know that they, too, can survive and thrive, despite what life throws at them. 
 Because if a girl like Frannie can survive like a blade of grass sprouting from the hard concrete of Brooklyn, so can they."
4,"I LOVED ""The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Frye"" and Rachel Joyce is a brilliant writer. That being said, I did not enjoy this story as much as ""Harold Frye"". Queenie was a bit of a mystery in the first book and I think I would have preferred she stayed that way. I don't want to give too much of the story away but I struggled with this book because I simply couldn't relate to nor sympathize with Queenie's character. By the end, I did feel more compassion toward her and the surprise twist at the end pulled everything together (like I said, the writing itself is brilliant); but I find it difficult to enjoy a story when I feel like I'm supposed to sympathize with a character but I simply never do. 
 It is possible that I would enjoy the story more if I re-read ""Harold Frye"" then re-read this one, but I have to be honest: I was disappointed. 
 To answer the question about whether this is a stand alone book... I say NO. You will not get as much out of it if you don't read ""Harold Frye"" first. I can't see it making much sense. 
 Ugh... I wanted to LOVE it!"
5,Most disapointing book ever --for ending. I just want to keep reading and reading. Such a fully realized world and populated with multi-faceted characters.
4,"I found myself reading the entire Hathaway series. Several of them were particularly charming, including this one. Beatrice is such an appealing character because she loves animals and compares romances to animal relationships. And the plot was not forced like in some of the others in this series."
1,"So I'm going to be honest, I probably read about half this book, maybe a bit more and I could. not. get. through. it. I am putting this one maybe permanent hiatus. It had so many good reviews and I really liked Hoyt's The Raven Prince so I thought I would give this a go. I just could not accept the Ms. Perfect Heroine, who really bothered me because she was sooooo self-righteous. GIVE ME A BREAK! Maybe by the end of the book she would have converted her misguided hero (and gin is my favourite vice so all the gin-hating was a bit of a downer)! Ugh. Just my opinion by the perfect lady was just too perfect for me to want to invest any more time in, although I may finish it just because I liked the hero so much!"
5,"I used run screaming from anything to do with Fae, unless Holly Black wrote it. I hadn't found anything that interested me at all wrote it. Until I read Need. 
 Just to make this clear, whoever designed this cover needs to be slapped. It's one of the worst cover's I've ever seen and it really creeps me out. I love the story however so it's all good as long as I don't have to look at it too much. 
 I love that Zara's a hippie. You don't get enough Hippie girls in books. Weres and Pixies after I've posted my Urgent Appeal letter! I love it. The plan didn't work out well but it was hilarious all the same. I cracked up when she started yelling about Were-Bunnies. I liked her character from the beginning which is unusual for me, I usually find them annoying at first. I think it was partly because she's a part of Amnesty International. I'm more of a Greenpeace girl myself. Saving sharks from becoming tuna and all that jazz. 
 I actually liked the love interest! A certain blogger will love me for this. Usually I'm quite picky but Nick was a really good character and actually fit in with the story instead of just being there or having the story centred around him. I liked that his and Zara's relationship was there but not really full on and heavy like in other books. Usually I feel like I'm suffocating with it. 
 When you start the book it might feel a little like Twilight but I didn't notice that until a review pointed it out. Sure, Zara's mom has packed her off to a small town but I honestly didn't notice any Twilight references as the plot is a lot stronger and the characters aren't cardboard. 
 I found the Stephen King references fascinating (although one does wonder if there are any Vampires in his books? I think not). Of course, she's going to Maine so that's an obvious one. I also picked up the quote as soon as I saw it, which I wanted to pat myself on the back for. 
 There's a few cliched moments in this and moments where you go 'I knew it!' but that's to be expected after all. I'm curious to see how the plot develops in the next book as this could quite easily have been a stand-alone."
3,"A fun book about an orphaned boy and magic ... in England. 
 Hahahha!!!! Gotcha! 
 No this is not Harry Potter - by any stretch of the imagination - but it's a good twist on the whole idea of magic and the apothecaries of old. They really did have a sense of magic in what they created and their secrets and recipes were no doubt seen that way. 
 This book has the added layer of murder and - well - almost a 'mason-like' adventure. It's fast paced and has likable characters. I'm sure the series will be equal to the first and it will be worth pursuing."
3,"3.5 stars 
 It's a good book and the plot has some interesting ideas and likable/interesting characters. But there are entire scenes I could have lived without... I skipped a lot because I wanted to read ""the interesting parts"". Still, I would like to read the second book in the series."
4,"Paper Towns is an amazing book. It's a story in about learning to see others as they truly are, not as images of what you want them to be, and the way John Green goes about telling it is wonderful."
3,I read all 3 books of this series (if there aren't any more) because they were all bound together in about a day ignoring the homework I had due the day after :( But I completely loved reading this (my love for reading is starting to come back) I read everything in one day!!!!!! And the love triangle <3 Lj Smith seriously writes the best love triangles (and the one I'm rooting for actually stand a chance!!!!!)
5,"Absolutely delicious. This could be the best school evah. Get rid of all the old guard and leave only wolverine to tend to the matriculation. What could go wrong, after all? Apocalypse kid? I can't wait to read more. 
 Thanks to all you peeps out there turning me on to these little gems, I'm probably going to have a few sleepless nights ahead of me."
5,"When I was little and also when I was obsessed with princesses, Cinderella was my favorite. Then I heard about this book last year and thought it would copy the Disney movie and original book too much, until I read it. 
 Gotta say, this was such a twist to Cinderella. I should have read it sooner. That's one of my biggest regrets in reading. Lesson:Never judge a book by anything until you actually read it. I think that's a lesson already tho... Marissa Meyer played with my emotions a lot throughout Cinder effortlessly. The ending was such a shock. Wow. Just wow. 
 I never failed to hate the stepmother. I loved a certain android a lot. Good Nandos, I need to read the next book ASAP. This book has one of the evilest cliffhangers that I've ever read so far this year."
5,"More like 4.5/5 stars but just because of the ending. Especially after Allegiant, I was really looking for a happier ending and this wasn't it. Still really enjoyed it though, especially when they went to Antarctica (that was SO cool). Definitely recommend this trilogy. Wish there were more books!"
4,"It is very short, but I really liked it."
3,"Reboot was a good read, but it felt slow in some places. 
 I liked Callum. He came out with some funny lines, and still had his humanity. 
 I didn't like Wren, Especially in the first half. 
 I just couldn't connect with her. She didn't show much emotion, had no problem killing people, and kept on saying how much she didn't like screaming, which started to get really annoying. 
 She just felt like a robot. 
 The issues i had with Wren, meant i didn't feel the romance. 
 Near the end, it improved, but not drastically. I still didn't find it sweet, or romantic, or even like it, but i didn't hate it either. 
 Overall, good, but the romance didn't wow me."
5,"I love the Nalini Singh's Psy/Changeling series. Tangle of Need was another great addition to this series. Although there is no major battle in this book, it had me riveted to the pages. Ms. Singh had multiple story lines going throughout and although this was the story of Riaz and Adria it touched on many of the other character story lines as well. I know I mentioned in my notes that I didn't enjoy the email type writing in the book, I have to admit I kind of skimmed over all the To: Fwd: Fwd: CC: etcetera... so, if it was important it was lost on me. Ultimately Tangle of Need grabbed me, made me feel for the characters, pulled me into the shifter/pys world and touched me emotionally with the struggles Adria had with Riaz's mating instinct. Great read! Looking forward to what can come of the aquatic shifters!!!"
5,"Every bit as engrossing as the last, and with quite a bit more brutality now that wars are flaring up. I'd love to see this adapted as a TV miniseries, like Game of Thrones--and it has the advantage of being relatively short (only three books) and already completed."
5,i'm never bored with this novel! Full of emotions
5,"For the longest time, I have avoided reading HUSH, HUSH. I've heard everything about it from how I'd either love it, hate it, how it was too similar to TWILIGHT, how it wasn't anything like TWILIGHT, how Patch was a psycho.... you name it, and I've read the review and/or commentary. So it was with great reluctance that I began reading this book. Ironically, I had no expectations for the book because of all the mixed opinions out there. I truly did not know how I would feel about it, and I think that's what made me love it even more. 
 But if you don't believe me, I started this book at 11PM 9/14/10... and am up writing this review at 3:30AM 9/15/10. With my college class waiting for me bright and early in a few hours. 
 The sleep deprivation will be so worth it. 
 I adored Nora from the start. She wasn't like your typical YA heroine who becomes a puddle of moronic hormones the second a hot guy or two saunters onto her radar. She's spunky and suspicious of Patch during their first encounter. And their next. And the next. This girl has a level head (though there were some moments where she succumbed to the hotness that is Patch, and I don't blame her in the slightest), which is a respectable and rare quality in most YAs I've read as of late. 
 Which is why, while I appreciated the friendship betwixt Nora and Vee, I also didn't like it. I felt like Nora could do a lot better, and sometimes wished she would give Vee a good shake or two. If insanity and absentmindedness ever hooked up, Vee would be their miracle baby. 
 And Patch... Oh Patch, he has just secured a special place in my heart. I thought I was going to hate him. I thought he was some psycho and that all the reviews calling him such cruel names were spot on. I had my suspicions about him; wondered to myself how Becca was going to redeem him in my eyes after all this talk with murder and whatnot. 
 I loved the connection between Nora and Patch. I was giggling like a buffoon after reading a few of the scenes where the two get up close and personal. I was convinced of the attraction between the two, which is so important to me when I read a PNR. This, like a few other YAs I've read, redeemed the genre for me. I need more Nora and Patch pronto. 
 The ending was my favorite part. I didn't see it coming, and it was perfect. Perfect. Even now, an hour later, I've got a huge smile on my face. 
 Aside from a few parts that confused me, and Vee being silly, I had no complaints about this book. The confusing parts seemed a little vague, yet were explained a few pages later. And Vee? Well, I'll just think of her as the special sidekick for now. 
 HUSH, HUSH is one of the few books that I think the masses were spot on about. This book was amazing, and I am SO incredibly happy that I'll be able to read CRESCENDO soon enough. I think this novel is one of my favorite fallen angel stories out there. Highly suggest checking this one out!"
5,"This is a wonderful book. It doesn't suffer from the chaotic flaws in American Gods. It's stand alone. And it's remarkable. It's a police thriller, kind of. But mostly a story of brothers and self-discovery and growth. It's sensual, magical and draws you in from start to end. I adored it."
5,"Love is: pulling an all-nighter to re-read a book you read barely two months ago. Yes, I love it that much! 
 This is exactly the kind of book I love to read about: two damaged characters seemingly so wrong for each other but find a way to their HEA. 
 This is my first book by this author that I have read. I must agree with the writer that this book really was beta'ed to submission. I found the execution flawless. It is in short a well written book and an excellently told story. 
 This is not your run of the mill BDSM book built on scene after scene. In fact it almost feels like a cautionary tell of how things can go wrong. 
 Be warned that if you are a Stevie Nicks fan you will be singing her songs while you read this book and possibly days after you are done with it ;-)"
4,"The characters were incredibly real, terribly flawed, and hopelessly entangled. But you only discover this after getting well into it. 
 Though all of the main characters were repellant in one way or another, I did find myself pulling for Rachel to quit drinking, clean herself up, and to quit telling lies. The author does a great job of revealing each character and pulling you in to the grit. Be prepared for a bit of emotional abrasion. 
 I listened to this, and thought the readers were great. Though bit harder to do on the audio, pay attention to the timeline."
4,"Layla, Roth, and Zayne are back in the final installment to author Jennifer L. Armenrout's The Dark Elements series. The novel picks up immediately where the last novel ended - with the threesome and their friend Stacey facing a very huge predicament. The action was fast-paced as the teens, along with the Wardens, try to stop the Lilin that was running amok around Washington, D.C., and try to put an end to the impending apocalypse. Aside from saving the world, Layla had another big problem. Should she spend the rest of her life with handsome, sweet Zayne, or dark and dangerous Roth? Armentrout delivers! Not only is the series wrapped up nicely, but Layla's final choice in suitor is well-earned and completely makes sense to what has happened in the previous novels. Cont..."
2,"My gosh, this book drove me crazy... I can't believe I have read the same book as all those 5 star reviews. I rolled my eyes so much throughout this book I finished with a headache.... Where to start? 
 This book was full of mistakes, words in wrong places, wrong words altogether, typos, even the character Skylar was called Sawyer at one point. Seriously it needs an editor, desperately. If an author is going to put all their heart and soul into a book and release it, they need to get someone to edit it. Yes it costs money, but its your baby, surely you want it to look its best. The author mentions a beta reader in her acknowledgments, that beta should have pointed those faults out to the author. 
 The story... The main character Mira chopped and changed so much I felt like she had a multiple personality disorder. In fact both her and Skylar whose point of view we also got, talked to themselves on numerous occasions, not how normal people talk to themselves though more like they were talking to another person. Maybe they did have multiple personality disorder... The character Jacoby, his name annoyed the hell out of me. Because the book was full of typo's the first time I read It assumed that's what it was. But no... It was always spelt Jacoby. 
 Now 'The Big Twist' it has so many (insert F word) holes.. It doesn't work.. For a start (view spoiler)[ if she was in a coma the whole way through the book, why and how did we get Skylar's POV..That just doesn't make sense at all. It totally understand how she interpreted what she heard him say but not his POV when he drove to the other clubhouse etc (hide spoiler)] the only thing I can think is that (view spoiler)[what we think was her coma dream, wasn't and was real, and the ending (her waking up from coma) was the dream she has laying next to Skylar. So the next book she will wake up again. (hide spoiler)] 
 I will still read the sequel because I need to see how all this ridiculousness plays out. So kudos to the author for getting more money out of me."
4,"Beatrice Maria Estrella Giovannini has life all figured out. She's starting senior year at the top of her class, she's a shoo-in for a scholarship to M.I.T., and she's got a new boyfriend she's crazy about. The only problem: All through high school Bea and her best friends Spencer and Gabe have been the targets of horrific bullying. 
 So Bea uses her math skills to come up with The Formula, a 100% mathematically guaranteed path to social happiness in high school. Now Gabe is on his way to becoming Student Body President, and Spencer is finally getting his art noticed. But when her boyfriend Jesse dumps her for Toile, the quirky new girl at school, Bea realizes it's time to use The Formula for herself. She'll be reinvented as the eccentric and lovable Trixie--a quintessential manic pixie dream girl--in order to win Jesse back and beat new-girl Toile at her own game. 
 Unfortunately, being a manic pixie dream girl isn't all it's cracked up to be, and ""Trixie"" is causing unexpected consequences for her friends. As The Formula begins to break down, can Bea find a way to reclaim her true identity and fix everything she's messed up? Or will the casualties of her manic pixie experiment go far deeper than she could possibly imagine? 
 This book was super hilarious and cute. I really liked it."
5,"The only reason I would hate this book is because it left me on tenterhooks for so freaking long. There's only so much suspense I can handle people! Despite having what should be the most unbelievable premise What's Left of Me rockets along with a lot of questions, a little answers, and one really great heroine. Waiting for the sequel is killing me already."
4,"I loved it! The only author I'm familiar with was Julia Quinn after having read most of her Bridgerton novels. There are three different love stories in one event and though I still felt the shivers in the first story between Alec and Gwen, I didn't like it that much. The next two however, I couldn't stop until the end. Kate and Neill's story was a page-turner, I've always liked childhood friends turned lovers, there's the foundation of a strong attraction between them. 
 It's amazing what puberty does to friends, one notices things like the color of one's hair or his/her physique, and I was glad for Kate speaking her mind and Neill accepting and loving her just as she is. He really worked hard for her, risking his life for the war and all the while Kate thought she's not woman enough. After four years of not seeing each other, they were finally ready. I liked how honorable Neill acted as chaperone, and how he relinquished the role to Tom, Kate's brother. 
 From the beginning, I knew Hugh and Georgie would end up together, especially when Hugh asked why Georgie couldn't be on the list. Her fear is about death of a loved one, which was absurd because she's worried about something inevitable she fails to just live for the moment, unlike Hugh. There were misunderstandings between them because they see things differently, but they realized they belong with one another. 
 The tone of the whole book is light and comic. I liked how manipulative Carolyn was and how her husband adores her. I just noticed one thing and that's the book wasn't really thoroughly edited because the spelling kept changing from Carolyn to Caroline and I stuck with the first because that's how my name is spelled (Joy is my second name). I'm looking forward to Eloisa James's ""Desperate Duchesses"" series, and checking out Connie Brockway's works too."
1,"I did not like this book at all. I marked it as dnf because I skipped most of it. It was boring, don't feel the need to say much more than that."
4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 Well, well, this book did a great job of making up for my reading slumps and my (what do you call it?) small disdains on some chapters. The plot was amazing-a devil and an angel falling in love and one of them dies just like Romeo and Juliet but written and told in a much more new awesome way. Dark and light. After the chapters of Madrigal, I made a theory about her being reincarnated into Karou and hell yeah I was right! They both fell for each other again-two times and they were happy, BUT ANOTHER tragedy is revealed before Karou realizes it! And so the ending was not what I expected and THAT amazed me. 
 The characters though.....I didn't really like them. I don't know, I feel like Akiva is missing some character development and Madrigal was so cheesy about her love for Akiva. Both of them spent time together and they were freakin' careless about it, but anyway that wouldn't make a good story if they weren't caught. No offense, but I like Karou better than Madrigal even if she was her reincarnation. 
 So the rating: 4.57"
3,"Meh, as the shelf name suggests. Despite the cute-ish feel to it there were just some things I couldn't get over. Sarah not admitting that her BEST FRIEND FROM CHILDHOOD was a boy so that she could continue her relationship. Main character being far too possessive, regardless of if it's a family trait or not there is no reason for him to go all grrrr, hackles raised over some small things. Melodrama...you've heard a lot of these complaints before. 
 Regardless, I didn't think this book was horrible, there was a creeper coach (plot device may haps but interesting nonetheless), cute enough romance, interesting side characters, and friendships that felt real enough. 
 Maybe a quick read if your a very tolerant person and the next book in the series sound interesting enough, but over all I don't think I can recommend it. 
 Thank you for your time and consideration."
5,"First time I have read anything by this author, but it sure wont be the last. I loved this book and am a sucker for second chance romance....this sure did not disappoint. Reed was all sorts of yum and I enjoyed every second of this book. Would love to see a book about Luke, Sophie and Jack....."
5,"I THINK THIS HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE BEST SCIFI BOOKS OUT THERE! 
 The whole reading experience was phenomenal! The audiobook was stellar! 
 Everything was very cinematic! 
 Thought that it's going to be a book about tragedy but AAAAAH I love the last 100 pages, so bittersweet!"
4,and I'm done. tears still pouring down my face. wow.
5,"I found it very engaging and emotional, and I loved every bit of it. I actually still remember some of the descriptions from it even thou it's been a while since I've read it. It really is amazing!"
4,"3.75, just short of being 4 stars. 
 I enjoyed this book more than the first but didn't find it all that great until the last third of it. I think I am definitely starting to connect more to the story and characters (although Simon annoyed me a lot in this book). I love Jace, he's by far my favourite character! I hope the next book captures my attention more and I become more invested, as I'm slowly starting to see why these books are so popular."
2,"2.5 Stars 
 Alright, no one kill me, but this book was mediocre. 
 Not a fan. Didn't necessarily dislike it, but I disliked it more than I liked it, if that even makes sense."

 Rating: 5 out of 5 Controllers 
 Review Source: Purchase/Audiobook 
 Reviewer: Me 
 Oh My GOODNESS... 
 I already knew Gena Showalter could write a steamy romance. If I need my socks to be rocked, or an emotion to be catered to, she's the author I let sweep me off my feet and carry me to places I can only envision in my dreams. But after hearing her vivid descriptions vibrate though my ear - literally I felt vibrations - I utterly fell in love with her words all over again. I don't know if this is the most sexual Lords of the Underworld novel she's written - it was definitely one of the longest - or if it was because I listened to it via audiobook instead of reading the words myself, but I will gladly listen to every book she writes from now on, no longer wanting to fill my eyes with the words but instead fill my ears with the passion. 
 That's right...passion... 
 In case you need your memory refreshed or you have somehow (insert *gasp* here) missed out on this wicked adventure, the Lords of the Underworld is a series about a group of immortal guards to the Olympians who were possessed by the elusive evils of mankind - or in this case demons - from Pandora's Box (ex: wrath, lies, secrets, defeat, rage, pain, misery, etc.) after releasing them into the world. In each installment, Showalter takes us on an emotional, and highly addictive, ride as these warriors find true love in the most unlikely places. In The Darkest Seduction (book 9) we are following the heartbreaking story of Paris, the warrior cursed with the demon Promiscuity. Can a wounded man who is doomed to sleep with a woman in order to maintain his health and strength find love with the only woman who arouses, challenges, and calls to him on every level? I didn't think it could happen, but I'm so glad it did. 
 Paris and Sienna, a love that looked disaster-prone from the beginning. The couple had so many hurdles to cross it seemed impossible Showalter could make it work, complete opposites, both with demons, inner and outer, to fight. Paris encased by a new evil and Sienna with her shame and guilt. I never liked Sienna. She irritated me from the very first moment Paris ran into her a couple of books ago. There was always something about the arrogant woman (not to mention how she treated my Paris) that rubbed me the wrong way and to think she was going to be Paris's love interest threw me into a frenzy. But what happened over the course of the story changed my viewpoint. Not only did I begin to like Sienna, I began to love her for the depths of her determination. But of course making readers love a character you should hate is a Showalter specialty. 
 So much happens in this book. Ringing in at over 500 pages not only does Gena create a fascinating love story, but she also brought war to our Lords. For the fans that have been waiting for something EPIC to happen in the LotU story arc, this is the book where it all starts to come together. Battles happen, lines are drawn, sides are chosen, enemies and alliances make themselves known. The well of betrayal runs deep in this novel and so does the repercussions. I was gritting my teeth as the narrator unfolded the story from his lips. Gosh it was crazy! On-the-edge-of-your-seat exciting. Side stories ran rampant in this book as we get to see more interaction between Cronus and Rhea, an introduction to Galen and Legion's love story (*fingers crossed*), Zacharel and the fallen angels (which alludes to her new Angels of the Dark series). Like I said, it's a lot to take in, but I think if you go the audiobook route like I did you might not find yourself so overwhelmed. 
 Anya, William, and the Lord of Narcissism Viola (yes there are women Lords), are all spectacular, funny, and downright crazy. Love, love, love them! Viola is a hoot. She's actually borderline crazy although you can't blame her she's a narcissist. Showalter also seemed to be setting up Kane's storyline, and if you know anything about the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse then you know his story is going to be amazing. We also get a glimpse at possibly more demon Lords, and a couple of new additions to the Lord family...babies! 
 Overall, fangirl gushing aside, The Darkest Seduction is definitely dark, twisted, emotional, amusing, steamy, and one of my personal favorites from the series. For those of you new to the series, although the novel can work as a standalone title, I urge you to read the series from the beginning. Behind every happily ever after romantic storyline, is a one-of-a-kind adventure that I promise will keep you on the edge of your seat, toes curled, and heart pounding. Buy it, read it, listen to it, I don't care how you do it as long as you fall in love with these Lords."

 I love the smart mouth that Nick is. He reminds me of myself."
4,Very slow beginning but great ending!
4,"The first part of the book was a little ridiculous then it became heartbreaking, I actually cried. The middle part of it was dull for me. I didn't feel the chemistry between Molly and Kevin there. And their progress was unbearably slow. Good thing the last part of the book saved it. Though I really wish SEP developed the characters in the middle of the book. 
 I was annoyed with Molly 2/3 of the book but she redeemed herself in the end in my opinion. Kevin was such a sweetheart but the story lacked his development. I wanted more from him. He didn't give me the Alpha Male vibe/attitude (much) not till the last parts of the book. 
 But overall, I had fun. I thought this was going to be my fave book but Nobody's Baby But Mine still has the top spot."
0,1/10: Couldn't get past the first few chapters; not for me.
4,"So beautifully poignant I wish it were all real. 
 (Wait, it is.)"
4,"This is a really good fantasy book! But I had a hard time finishing this one, which is I don't know why. 
 The idea of super powers in a unique world is awesome! I love how it is beautifully written. 
 I like Alina, she's a strong heroine. I also like Mal even though he's got little appearance here. I thought I like the Darkling, but he's cruel and I hate that I still wish he's not. 
 I highly recommend this book to all who loves fantasy and romance. :)"
4,"The concept of this was enough to make me consider buying it and the art just sealed the deal, it's so beautiful. I'll admit the middle was a shade weak but holy crap, the ending was SO GOOD!"
4,"***THIS BOOK IS NOT ROMANCE*** 
 Although I am NOT an erotica reader, I was very curious about this series after meeting the author at a recent conference, so I decided to give it a go. 
 The story is a woman's introduction into the world of BDSM. As to be expected, it is sexually adventurous, extremely explicit and a bit shocking at times, but also well written and engaging. 
 This first book is purely about sex although the heroine later develops a romantic relationship with her chosen Dom. 
 This is the first in a series of short novellas that the author has recently compiled into one volume 
 Brie Learns the Art of Submission: Submissive Training Center 
 . 
 Recommended only to those who enjoy erotica."
4,"Actual Rating: 4.5 Stars 
 This book was absolutely adorable and it made me so happy! 
 The Fill-In Boyfriend is the perfect contemporary read. It's light, fluffy, and funny. Fake dating gets me every time! 
 I loved all the characters (except for Jules. I hate that bitch), especially Hayden *heart eyes*. I loved Gia and Bec's friendship and how everyone interacts with each other. 
 ""Hayden?"" 
 ""Yes, Gia?"" 
 ""Nothing I just wanted to say your name"" 
 I loved how much character development Gia went through, much to the thanks of Hayden and his family, and I was delighted whenever there was a Hayden and Gia moment. 
 I really want more of Kasie West's books now!"
5,One of the best paranormal books I've read! Highly recommended!
5,"I loved this! It was 5 stars all the way for me! I definitely liked it better than Anna! 
 I feel the characters were all really full. I love Lola's coming to age. 
 I really liked the deeper themes in this. I loved how elements, such as gay parents and homeless, aren't big deals in this book. 
 I'll definitely be picking up Isla soon!"
5,"I think i fell in love with froi.... yup i did... 
 I think that the last 2 books of the series are better than the first one.. I will love this story for all life!!"
3,"Originally posted on my website, Koenix 
 Jemisin is one of my favorite authors, and I adore many of her books. Unfortunately, the Dreamblood duology is not my favorite. I read The Killing Moon two years ago and was relatively unimpressed by it, compared to how much I loved the Inheritance Trilogy. So I put off reading The Shadowed Sun for a long time... and it suffered from the same problems as the first book. 
 It picks up 10 years after the events in The Killing Moon. Gujaareh wants to shake off the invasion of the Kisuati, and Wanahomen (the Prince) returns to lead that rebellion and regain his throne. Hanani, a female Sharer, is left as a hostage in Wanahomen's camp to ensure his alliance with the Hetawa (the dreamsharers of Gujaareh). Tiaanet is the daughter of a noble man also trying to ally himself with Wanahomen, while also attacking at the Hetawa. A dream plague strikes the city of Gujaareh, and the Hetawa are helpless against it. So, there are two things going on: the impending fight between Gujaareh and Kisuat and Wanahomen's power grab, and then the dream plague that no one can stop. 
 The Shadowed Sun is about women. The two major societies (Banbarra and Gujaareh) are both supposed to revere and respect women, but in reality, there are some harsh truths about misogyny, sexual violence, rape, and incest. And I simply did not enjoying reading about these things, even though they are included for reasons integral to the story. Our two main female characters are both subjected to rape or attempted rape. It's intense and upsetting. 
 However, the bottom line with this book is that I was never drawn to the characters or the plot. I wasn't rooting for the protagonists. I disliked Wanahomen intensely; I disliked his relationship with Hanani; I don't particularly like Sunandi; I didn't care to read about Tiaanet... I could go on. Because I was never invested in the characters and their motivations, I got nowhere with the story. The worldbuilding is the best part. I love the idea of the dreamers and the Hetawa. But everything else had me upset or bored. I'm happy to have finally finished this series and be caught up with all of Jemisin's novels, but I am far more impressed in her new Broken Earth series."
5,"This book is the third in the series and deals with Kim the Korean doctor we met in ""Collision Course"". 
 Kim is a quiet thinker and he is well teamed up with Shane who in some ways seems the complete opposite and at others has a lot in common with him. 
 In K.A's books most of the conflict doesn't come about from some outside source (ie murder or evil character) it comes from differences in the characters personalities and their past. It is the way these characters, who invariably have straight up physical attraction, morph this into a stronger emotional connection that make her books so enjoyable to read. 
 I think it was this paragraph that took my admiration from four stars to five: 
 ""Kim found the soft skin behind Shane's ear and licked down to his collarbone. He swore just the taste was enough to get him hard. He was going to have to apologize for laughing at that article on the vomeronasal organ in adult humans because this had to be pheromones. Nothing else could explain that one taste, one breath of his skin made Kim want to bury himself in this man, wrap himself in Shane until it was all he ever touched or tasted."", [K. A. Mitchell, No Souvenirs:] 
 Thoroughly recommended. 
 Edited to add. I just read this again and have moved it up to my favorite K.A. Mitchell book and one of my favorites of all time. There is so much to appreciate on the re-read, the reef scenes, the pacing, that difficulty for both men to open up to what was going on inside. The sex scenes are superbly written, only enough Slot A to Slot B being given to create a picture, the whole emphasis more on the effect it had. 
 In some ways, it is better writing than ""Collision Course"" as re-reading brought out lots of little ""shows"" done in simple sentences that I missed on the first reading. 
 The descriptions of scenes are so well done and well integrated into the story. 
 Not a DIK but a scarily small reef keeper."
5,"HOLY COW MY FEELINGS. 
 Sarah J. Maas tore me apart, stitched me back together, and then tore me apart again. I loved every single sentence on every single one of those 624 pages...and it still wasn't enough. I NEED MORE. 
 I am not ashamed to admit that I am completely and thoroughly in love with this series, and I don't know how I'm going to last until the next book is released. This series came at the perfect time, reigniting my passion for reading and sucking me deep into the incredible storyline. I don't have a single complaint about this book; it's perfect and might very well be one of my favorite books I've ever read. 
 Feyre transformed from a broken shell into a badass warrior, and I loved seeing her blossom. Particularly in the Night Court, surrounded by the best bunch of faeries in all of Prythian. 
 I cannot express how much I adore the family unit in the Night Court. Mor, Amren, Cassian, and Azriel each have their own personalities and skill sets, and each are undyingly loyal to the rest. 
 Rhysand, oh Rhysand. I must say, when I began rooting for him at the end of A Court of Thorns and Roses, I was a little ashamed of myself. How could I accept Rhys when Tamlin had done so much for Fayre? Well guess what, A Court of Mist and Fury quickly silenced any remnants of affection I still held for Tamlin as I was swept into the wonderful world of Rhysand. 
 Everything about Rhys and Fayre's relationship is magical. Their ability to understand the other and their needs, their steadfast support of each other, and their overwhelming love for each other (view spoiler)[aka the MATING BOND ahhhhh (hide spoiler)] makes them perfect for each other. 
 The ending almost killed me, and I pray the next book heals my gaping heart (view spoiler)[because I can't stand the thought of Feyre being back in the Spring Court with Tamlin while Rhysand tries to fight back against Hybern (hide spoiler)]. 
 What I need in the next book: 
 (view spoiler)[Cassian and Nesta, Mor and Azriel, Feyre and Rhysand back together forever, and the slow and painful deaths of Jurian and the King of Hybern (hide spoiler)]. 
 Maas, I'm a convert. Please give me more."
2,"""One of us is Lying"" is one of my most anticipated books in 2017... However, I was pretty disappointed in the book... 
 I started reading this a while back, but never brought myself to finishing it. So today, I decided to skip the mid-200 pages and just read the end (because I wanted to know what/how everything happened) - and gosh - I'm so glad, I didn't read the whole book because the ending left me SO dissappointed. I wasn't happy with the ending at all. Unfortunately,...

4,"I honestly don't know what to make of this book. On one hand, I want to believe the governess, I want to believe that everything that happened wasn't a direct product of her imagination. On the other hand, it is just so unbelievable. One thing's for sure though, The Turn of the Screw is a phenomenal read."
4,"A little weird how long it took for them to get together. For people that lived next door, they did not see each other for weeks? But I liked Kettle and Adeline and enjoyed their story. Kettle did a couple of things (or rather did not do) that irritated me, but they would not prevent me from reading the book."
2,"The biggest fault I can find in this book are its lack of originality (I mean, a war love story? She's a nurse and he gets injured? They have a baby? Come on), although, given that this book was written about 100 years ago before any novel became ""unoriginal"" this might be overlooked. 
 Anyways, I think that of greater importance than the plot is notorious style that Hemmingway is known for. From what I recall of The Old Man and the Sea, in said novel Hemmingway fully embraced his sort of cavemannish way of writing, enveloping the story in a sorts of mist of image. Rather than the endless blathering that some other authors could have given to the times out at sea, EH kept it succint and beautiful. 
 HOWEVER, what the heck happened here? A Farewell to Arms is pretty much a failure in this sense. What I enjoy about the so called ""Iceberg Theory"" is that you have to think things through a bit, visualize them is harder but ""realer"", etc. In summary, it creates attentive readers. 
 #Fail 
 What the ""Iceberg Theory"" created in A Farewell To Arms, however, was the opposite from attentive readers. After all, it provided shallow characters in boring settings with a predictable plot and evident foreshadowing. Maybe he was trying to portray Catherine as a flimsy kind of woman, but given her life history I highly doubt it. And then, the main character of the story, there are some hints at what his line of thought are, which is the only time when I think this theory of omission worked, but his dialogue was stupid. Just that, stupid. He wouldn't respond to what other characters asked him, he was monosyllabic to the point were it become obnoxious. 
 I have to say I'm a bigger fan of the verbose author, even if it can be a lot more painful to read."
3,"Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary is not for the faint of heart. The characters are very intense and the writing style is very practical. I was sucked into the story, but it was like watching a train wreck happen. Although this type of story isn't my favorite, this story did make me feel strongly. 
 I loathe Madame Bovary as a person. She was changeable and self centered. I cannot sympathize with her demise. Monsieur Bovary was blinded by his affection for Emma (Madame Bovary) and it led to their ruin. I pitied him, but I felt terribly for their daughter - Berthe. She was just forgotten. Very sad. 
 That said, this I do feel good for reading this classic. It took me two false starts to finish. I'm glad to have read it."

3,"I'm one of those people who prefer King's earlier works from the beginning of his career, but this sounded interesting, so I gave it a try. 
 It's not often that you can say about a Stephen King book that 'you wish he'd written more' but that is definitely the case with Revival. The main spooky aspect was, to me, a little Lovecraftian, and the characters were interesting, but there was very little detail about events in the book. The most exciting stuff happens at the end and then - the book's done. It kinda feels more like a novella that got stretched into a full-size book. 
 'Revival' is definitely worth reading, but it won't be going on my 're-read' shelf."
4,"Wow. 
 Haunting, beautiful, amazing, must read more! 
 The characters were engaging and did not fall prey to a lot of cliches that YA paranormal books sometimes have. 
 Adele was a smart girl even among the supernatural creatures of the French Quarter. I could see many more books being set in this world with these characters. 
 Full review up tomorrow (11.13) at hermitlibrarian.blogspot.com."
3,"I loved so much about this so much, especially the incredibly fresh setting and the few times we see the inserted ""Adventures"". Wein maintained her streak of writing books about girls who are too busy flying planes to think one way or another about dating, a niche which definitely needs filling. I maintained my streak of being politely interested in planes as needed. Unfortunately, the ending felt like a fizzle to me. It was exciting and rich but then it was just sort of over."

 ""If I had not fought, you would have had my hand. And my foot. Sometimes I sit under that tree there and look at my feet and ask if I couldn't have spared one. How could my foot be worth a prince's life? And the other two as well, the Humfreys, they were good men too."" Ser Humfrey Hardying had succumbed to his wounds only last night. 
 ""And what answer does your tree give?"" 
 ""None that I can hear. But the old man, Ser Arlan, every day at evenfall he'd say, 'I wonder what the morrow will bring.' He never knew, no more than we do. Well, migthen it be that some morrow will come when I'll have need of that foot? When the realm will need that foot, even more than a prince's life?"" 
 Maekar chewed on that a time, mouth clenched beneath the silvery-pale beard that made his face seem so square. ""It's not bloody likely,"" he said harshly. ""The realm has as many hedge knights as hedges, and all of them have feet."" 
 ""If Your Grace has a better answer, I'd want to hear it."" 
 Maekar frowned. ""It may be that the gods have a taste for cruel japes. Or perhaps there are no gods. Perhaps none of this had any meaning. I'd ask the High Septon, but the last time I went to him he told me that no man can truly understand the workings of the gods. Perhaps he should try sleeping under a tree."" He grimaced. ""My youngest son seems to have grown fond of you, ser. It is time he was a squire, but he tells me he will serve no knight but you. He is an unruly boy, as you will have noticed. Will you have him?"" 
 ""Me?"" Dunk's mouth opened and closed and opened again. ""Egg... Aegon, I mean... he is a good lad, but, Your Grace, I know you honor me, but... I am only a hedge knight."" 
 ""That can be changed,"" said Maekar. ""Aegon is to return to my castle at Summerhall. There is a place there for you, if you wish. A knight of my household. You'll swear your sword to me, and Aegon can squire for you. While you train him, my master-at-arms will finish your own training."" The prince gave him a shrewd look. ""Your Ser Arlan did all he could for you, I have no doubt, but you still have much to learn."" 
 ""I know, m'lord."" Dunk looked at him. At the green grass and the reeds, the tall elm, the ripples dancing across the surface of the sunlit pool. Another dragonfly was moving across the water, or perhaps it was the same one. What shall it be, Dunk? he asked himself. Dragonflies or dragons? A few days ago he would answered at once. It was all he had ever dreamed, but now that the prospect was at hand it frightened him. ""Just before Prince Baelor died, I swore to be his man."" 
 ""Presumptuous of you,"" said Maekar. ""What did he say?"" 
 ""That the realm needed good men."" 
 ""That's true enough. What of it?"" 
 ""I will take your son as squire, Your Grace, but not at Summerhall. Not for a year or two. He's seen sufficient of castles, I would judge. I'll have him only if I can take him on the road with me."" He pointed to old Chestnut. ""He'll ride my stot, wear my old cloak, and he'll keep my sword sharp and my mail scoured. We'll sleep in inns and stables, and now and again in the halls of some landed knight or lesser lording, and maybe under trees when we must."" 
 Prince Maekar gave him an incredulous look. ""Did the trial addle your wits, man? Aegon is a prince of the realm. The blood of the dragon. Princes are not made for sleeping in ditches and eating hard salt beef."" He saw Dunk hesitate. ""What is it you're afraid to tell me? Say what you will, ser."" 
 ""Daeron never slept in a ditch, I'll wager,"" Dunk said, very quietly, ""and all the beef that Aerion ever ate was thick and rare and bloody, like as not."" 
 Maekar Targaryen, Prince of Summerhall, regarded Dunk of Flea Bottom for a long time, his jaw working silently beneath his silvery beard. Finally he turned and walked away, never speaking a word. Dunk heard him riding off with his men. When they were gone, there was no sound but the faint thrum of the dragonfly's wings as it skimmed across the water. 
 The boy came the next morning, just as the sun was coming up. He wore old boots, brown breeches, a brown wool tunic, and an old traveler's cloak. ""My lord father says I am to serve you."" 
 4 1/2 stars"
3,"Actual Rating: 3.5 
 When is Goodreads going to let us start using half stars? I mean really! 
 Anyway, I enjoyed this story! The reason I gave this 3.5 stars is because I figured out the twist pretty early on. It was kind of obvious. I wish I had to think harder to figure it out. I had about 300 pages left after I figured out the twist. I didn't deter me from wanting to finish the book, though. 
 The other reason I gave it a 3.5 is because it was a little repetitive, especially the phrases dealing with clinching of fists, knuckles turning white and the such. In almost every chapter there was something written about how tense their hands were. 
 I liked the characters. There was the right amount of action. The world building was nice. It kind of read like a TV show. There was a bit of insta-love happening, but that seems the case in pretty much every YA book; it's something you kind of have to deal with. 
 I will definitely continue with the rest of the series."
3,I didn't particularly find the story that interesting after the first half of the novel. It was a little too dense for me to jump right into and finish it on time for class.
4,"I've been waiting for Dark Eden to be released in the US since it was published in the UK. 
 The premise is intriguing: two people are left behind on a world with no sun. Five generations later their descendants number over five hundred. John Redlantern is 15 and the first person to ever publicly question not only the decisions of the family elders but also the assumptions upon which the family bases itself. He questions how long they should hold on to the hope of rescue, how long they should keep retreading the steps and arguments of their ancestors, and whether there really is no room for dissent. More and less than all of that is John making himself the hero of his own story in a place where stories are important. 
 My first thoughts when finishing the book were that I wished it was a different book. I wanted to cherry pick the things out of it that I liked and leave behind the things that made me uncomfortable. I wanted the story told in third person so that I could get lavishly adjective-laden descriptions of the landscape. I wanted an ending tied up in bows. I wanted the themes of incest, gender, and power to have empowering messages. But that isn't this book and being disappointed in it for not setting off my five-star-tinglies when it is not only skillful and intelligently executed but also walked the line of making me feel uncomfortable while falling to neither the side of glorifying the state of the society nor the other side of creating an unrealistic fix. 
 After digesting the book for a while, I think I can let it be exactly what it is. I can wipe my expectations off the windshield, look around, and be glad that I did."
5,"4.5 stars 
 I skimmed this book and although I had trouble catching an interest in it, by the end, I was hooked. I like the idea of something supernatural helping you find your mate. Also. I like know the wolves do not need moonlight to shift, just to heal. I find it interesting that a werewolf fell for a vampire. The romance and love between the characters just jumps off the page. 
 A girl managing a mental hospital is almost raped, but is saved by a wolf who immediately knows that she is his mate. When he and his wolves are about to be attacked, she stands strong. When a zombie was at her back, she swung an axe perfectly. She helped the wolves navigate long since forgotten tunnels. During this chase, the team's beta wolf, second in command, realizes that his mate is the vampire hunting the team down. The vamp is going to go against the organization for killing her friend because of their experiments. However, she still works for them. In a cabin in the woods, the human girl and alpha wolf mate for the first time. Soon after, the vamp attacks the wolf team. The beta tells the human girl to run and he himself faces the vamp, but is captured. The wolf pack save the human girl from being raped, but she is shot when they are running away from the Project. To save her life, the alpha bites her to turn her into a werewolf. Since he hates his inner animal, he hates himself for being forced to do it to her, but she loves him anyway."
4,"Since I've read Falling Kingdom series, I sort of do a comparison. The organising isn't as good as that series, in my opinion ; however, it's still understandable. 
 Celaena is a dauntless character just like Katniss and Beatrice. We love to see our girl win, be the hero, and rebel. 
 Triangle is here. And I'm always on the side of poor loyal friend. I stood for Jacob and I lost. I stood for Simon yet I lost again. Why the girls only choose the good-looking one instead of their best friends? This time, I'm still the same. I stand for Chaol. I know that most of you girls like Dorian because he can read with you and give you puppies. That's very sweet of him. But I prefer the captain. I like the easy-going side of him which he shows only to me. I like it when he tells me to think instead of following my heart. 
 It's a fast-paced good read. You won't be able to stop yourself from turning the next page. 
 4 out of 5 stars"
2,"Maybe if I were a teenage boy, I would've been more interested, or even impressed by all this misogynistic rebel crap. But I am not. 
 And the analogy between McMurphy and Jesus? Are you freaking kidding me, Ken Kesey? Ugh, this book just irks me."
4,"The Rose Garden is a sweet historical romance that's not especially deep but is warm, light and generally happy. It is set in the cosy atmosphere of Cornwall in southern England, complete with its peculiar Brontean landscape and its changing weather, friendly people who are so easy to like, ancient customs and traditions and the long history that has matured the whole package like good wine. 
 Time travel takes us right back into history and is necessary for the development of the story, though it interferes very little and is more romantic than scientific. It facilitates the characters' meeting and nothing more. 
 The romance is sweet and ... romantic, and the characters almost live things in the right order, just a day or so out. It was a relief to find no description at all, and without it the atmosphere and storyline hold perfectly. 
 This is a good book to give a bit of comfort when needed, a light and warm pick-me-up that is a pleasant read from beginning to end."
2,"~2.5 
 This entire book was ruined for me by one small subplot, and I'm still fuming over it. In fact, other than the culmination of Irvin Irving's flanderisation to the Evil Schemer, I'm finding it hard to remember the plot in light of that subplot. 
 The subplot: one of the major suspects is a man who was ""sacrificed to the mob"" when he was thrown out of the LAPD for killing people with the choke hold. (That's right--the same type of chokehold that caused Eric Garner's death.) Here is Connelly's interpretation (spoken through Bosch's mouth, but taken as truth within the novel; in fact, it's spoken to an African-American woman who completely agrees with his conclusions) of the whole civil rights angle: The statistics [of choke hold deaths] matched up across racial and geographic lines. Sure, there were more choke hold deaths in the south end. Far more African Americans died than other races. But the ratios were even. There were far more incidents involving use of force in the south end. The more confrontations, scuffles, fights, resisting arrests you get, the more uses of the choke hold. The more you use the choke hold, the more deaths you will have. It was simple math. But nothing is simple when racial politics are involved.What Connelly takes for granted there is that a disproportionate number of African Americans needed to be ""subdued"" in the first place. And yet by another interpretation, these same statistics are proof of endemic racism within the department. Consider this possibility: the LAPD discriminates in their use of force against the African American community, which leads to a horrific increase in the number of deaths by police force. Shockingly, this might lead more people to resist arrest because they see what happens to the people who end up in LAPD hands. Those darned politically correct pedants; why do they assume this is related to race just because of the evidence? 
 But it doesn't stop there. According to Bosch:The task force recommended that the bar hold be dropped from the use-of-force progression and it was. Funny thing is, the department told officers to rely more on their batons--in fact, you could be disciplined if you got out of a patrol car without carrying your baton in your hand or on your belt. Added to that, Tasers were coming into use just as the choke hold went out. And what did we get? Rodney King. A video that changed the world. A video of a guy being Tased and whaled on with batons when a proper choke hold would've put him to sleep."" 
 This shows such a monumental degree of willful misunderstanding of the situation that I simply can't wrap my mind around it. Let's be realistic: Rodney King wasn't beaten to subdue him. He was already subdued; hell, he was on the ground. They were just beating him. Over and over and over. I find it so disgustingly offensive that Connelly tries to turn this into an example of political correctness gone amok that I can't really be coherent about it. 
 So why is my rating even a 2.5? Well, like everything else Connelly writes, this was eminently readable. I like the way that Connelly is developing Maddie, Bosch's daughter, as a character. One of the most common tropes in Connelly's book pops up again here--twice--but the way it is dealt with is more interesting than most of the other books where it appears. (view spoiler)[The trope is, of course, the exponentially increasing probability of Betrayal of Bosch's allies the more times they appear in the books. I don't think any character has ever been in more than one book without betraying Bosch, to the point that my first guess for any and all shenanigans are the repeat characters. In this case, Kiz politicks in a particularly despicable manner and his partner sells him out to the paper. It's the latter case I found more interesting, because I personally found the whining vastly irritating and was surprised that the generally unforgiving Bosch actually gave his partner another chance. (hide spoiler)] But even though I still find Connelly to be compulsively readable, this book left a sour taste in my mouth."
4,"I probably did more graphic novels this year than I've ever done in my whole life. Probably. 
 But even so, I've made my way through a few dozen heavyweights like Infinite Jest, The Complete Short Stories: Volume 1, The Complete Short Stories: Volume 2, and great number of other doorstoppers like Great North Road. 
 What did I love the most? 
 The Library at Mount Char, Radiance, Children of Time, The Boat of a Million Years, Life During Wartime, Stations of the Tide, and The Fortunate Fall. 
 Of course, there's a ton of runner-ups, like The Fifth Season, Luna: New Moon, Lolita, Illuminae, The Traitor Baru Cormorant, and Cuckoo Song, but we have to draw the line somewhere. I loved all of these books. 
 There were a few unknowns that stood heavily in my mind, too, such as The Bones of the Earth. I have a real sweet tooth for great over-the-top horror/dark fantasy. 
 I loved a lot more, too, or there's no way in hell I could justify my reading schedule or my devotion to the text. 
 There were a number of other beauties, but still, none were quite as beautiful as the ones I've mentioned. :) 
 For the year, I sit at a grand total of 499 books for a total of 117,451 pages. This includes a few short stories, novels, and all graphic novels. 
 I'm kinda surprised. I don't even feel ashamed that I couldn't squeeze in just ONE MORE TITLE. :) Oh well! Maybe next year! 
 Update 2/6/2016: 
 Just nominated my favorite SF for the 2015 HUGO, and here's the list: 
 The Library at Mount Char 
 Children of Time 
 Luna: New Moon 
 Radiance 
 The Fifth Season 
 I didn't nominate any shorts or novellas since I haven't read much of anything there, BUT, if anyone has any suggestions for the short categories, including Short Stories, Novelettes, or Novellas, throw them at me and I'll see if I can read them all before March 31 this year. Thanks!"

4,"Surprisingly, a wonderful read!"
2,"I was into this and I was kind of buying it and then it all kind of went to shit. 
 This is a modern retelling of The Scarlet Letter. Except our Hester is not married and had an affair with a married priest, became pregnant and had an abortion. In this dystopia, that means committing murder and your entire body is dyed red, called 'chroming'. 
 By the end of the book you're left with the message that for her to have this affair and have an abortion was God's will as a means to end chroming. And it's so much bullshit. Their love affair comes off as an obsession. She only knows him from a distance, he has her on a martyr pedestal. She grapples with her sexuality at the end of the book out of nowhere. I don't even know what that was about. That just left me thinking this character is so wildly confused any decisions she was making were completely out of left field. So for the author to insist that it was her finally taking control of her life? Um... bullshit. This book took the path of trying to strengthen a character who was questioning her spiritual surroundings but it never quite made it to the conclusion that she had solidified her convictions. 
 And can we just discuss how her 'protecting' him is total crap? In a heavily male dominated society like this one, he wouldn't have been cast out if she had named him. In fact, at the end of the book when he (view spoiler)[ confesses that he had an affair (hide spoiler)] people still bow down to worship and pray for him. Fail."

 4th&up 
 When fifth grader Rose Howard's beloved dog goes missing during a major storm, she begins a quest to find her canine friend- even if that means pushing past her comfort zone and making some hard choices. 
 Rain Reign is a lovely, emotional story that hits all the right notes. Martin does a wonderful job of giving voice to her autistic protagonist, and she masterfully conveys Rose's at times challenging, always unique and often beautiful view of the world. The storytelling in this novel is tight, concise and completely engaging. 
 Highly recommended."

 I received an advance reader edition of this book from Simon & Schuster and Net Galley for the purpose of providing an honest review. 
 4 Stars! 
 When I saw the opportunity to read an advance copy of this book, I was more than a little excited. I have read all of the books in the Gretchen Lowell series (some more than once actually) so I knew that I enjoy Chelsea Cain's writing. This book did not disappoint! Chelsea Cain is a master at writing characters that are deeply troubled. She puts that skill to use in this book. 
 One note of warning for some readers: This book is focused on crimes against children including, child pornography. Any readers who wish to avoid these subjects will want to avoid this book. 
 Kick was abducted by a stranger when she was 6 years old. She learned to survive in that environment until she was rescued 6 years later. As an adult, she finds herself dealing with the emotional scars directly connected to that time. Anytime an Amber alert is issued, she searches hoping to save that child from what she has been through. 
 Bishop approaches Kick and asks for her help in finding two children that have recently been kidnapped. Kick's knowledge may be the key to finding these children. Bishop and Kick work together in some very dangerous situations trying to find the victim in time. 
 This book was filled with troubled characters dealing with issues from their past. All of these characters came together to tell a story that was hard to put down. I would definitely recommend this book to others. I look forward to reading future books in the series."
3,"I'm not really sure how I feel about The Kingmaker's Daughter yet. The Neville sisters are interesting, and while I wouldn't say they're obscure figures in history, their stories certainly haven't been overtold. 
 That said, I'm not sure I really liked where she went with this book. (view spoiler)[I felt like Anne's preoccupation with making her dead father proud was misplaced. The first part of the book, afterall, goes out of the way to show us that daddy Warwick didn't care a bit about his daughters. He wasn't even particularly concerned with making them queens, but rather was determined to be the power behind the throne. Only once he realized he couldn't control Edward did he start thinking about making queens out of his daughters, but later on both sisters act as if their father's one true ambition in life was to see his daughters as queens. Once he died was like the Warwick of the first quarter or so of the novel never existed. (hide spoiler)] This might have been what she was going for, but at the same time, the disconnect was never really addressed and it bugged me. 
 I think the choice of narrator also limited the scope of the novel a bit too much. Anne Neville had a short life and although lots of action took place around her, she herself was not a key player. Gregory tries hard to make her into one, but a lot of the action still takes place ""offstage,"" that is, Anne learns about it secondhand. I know that Gregory pretty much always writes in 1st person but I think this novel might have been better with a 3rd person narrator. 
 Anyhow, it wasn't horrible and I did enjoy it, as I've enjoyed most of the other books in these series. I can't say that this series is the best ever written on the Cousin's War but it entertains well enough."
3,"3.5 stars 
 Between Saints and Sinners shines in many ways; the skillful handling of abuse and PTSD, the inclusion of a very sticky subject in religion and theology, difficult and absentee families, and a complicated relationship. This book could have gone horribly wrong but Sexton is a great writer and kept the subjects complicated yet not overwhelming. None of the characters are perfect or evil but show various shades of grey. They have intolerance yet also an ability to learn and change. Although not wholly successful for me, I think the story is an excellent example of complex issues and characters that never verge into extremes yet remain fascinating. 
 The plot begins with bartender Levi Binder avoiding his Mormon family to go surfing. Levi's life consists of surfing, bartending, random hookups and the occasional guilt ridden phone call from his very religious family. So when he meets massage therapist Jaime, Levi's predictable actions are to come on too strong and try to seduce Jaime. Unfortunately for Levi, Jaime was abused as a small child and has severe PTSD from his experience. Slowly Levi comes to understand Jaime's past but more importantly, falls in love with the person Jaime is. Together they heal each other and find happiness. 
 First of all the characters of Levi and Jaime are wonderful. Both are scared and hurt in various ways but find what they need in each other. Never one for relationships and preferring anonymous sex, Levi turns into a man that puts Jaime's needs first and doesn't obsess about sex. Jaime in turn learns to control his fear and not let the things that scare him control him. Both men are compelling and interesting on their own but it's their interaction together, the gentle love and obvious affection that really charms. There's a scene with Levi's family when Jaime is slightly anxious about the kind of Sprite Levi is buying and it shows not only how well they know each other but how well Levi handles Jaime's neurosis. It's lovely and romantic and shows the real connection between the two men. 
 The story unfortunately does stumble in a few areas. The first is religion. On the one hand the writing does a really masterful job in presenting the reality of the Mormon Church. It's not all Big Love so it's nice to see a much more intelligent example of a loving and caring family. The politics and religion presented are pretty close to the religion and its beliefs as well as the rhetoric also shown. Unfortunately, there is a lot of it in the book. This is important since Levi's family is a major secondary character but at the same there is a lot of God, religion, and theology in this story. So much that some readers may be turned off by it. I walked the line where sometimes I really appreciated the inclusion and other times I got sick of reading about it. I think the final scene with Levi's father is very nice and important yet way too much religion by then. But each reader will vary on how much religion and discussion they want in their romance. 
 On the flip side though the story simply shines with it's portrayal of Jaime's abuse and aftermath. Jaime is fragile yet incredibly brave and strong. Jaime initially lets his fear and abuse control his life but meeting Levi changes things. While both Levi and Jaime are great characters on their own with Levi's need to rebel and Jaime's desperate need for safety, this is a case where the sum of the men are greater than their parts. Together the couple is wonderful, charming, romantic, and lovely while apart they feel tragic. There's no great question of the two getting together although Jaime remains a little too naive and clueless, drawing out the happy ending. 
 Overall this is an excellent story with heart warming characters that will definitely appeal to readers. The religion aspect may be a sticking point for some as tastes vary. I find it's not wholly successful yet it does offer a very realistic and honest portrayal of the religion. However the real stars are the wonderfully complicated protagonists. You can't help but adore them and root for their much deserved happy ending."
2,This was OK. it was a little funny. I chuckled. Mostly it was pretty boring though.
3,"This was exactly what I wanted, so it was not at all disappointing: a page-turner that makes one feel like a child again, in terms of how one reads, staying up until 2 a.m. to finish it. Bits of clunky writing that improved in parts as the book went on, though the gimmicky structure of the book itself can't be helped--such is the nature of commercial fiction that bills itself as a thriller? It was one of those things where I wanted an unchallenging but gripping book and I thought of this one, since the movie is out. Emily Blunt's best role, in my opinion, was in The Devil Wears Prada and so I want to see her play a woman who is the literal opposite of that. 
 Rachel is a woman who has not succeeded in achieving a nice, middle-class life in the multiple roles of Wife and Mother and Successful Wage Slave. Due to these multiple ""failures"" she has started to drink more than what's socially acceptable. Thus, she is subjected to so much contempt from other people that it was heartbreaking at times, because this is reality as I've seen it play out in so many women's lives. (Not so much the alcoholism as the contempt; they're slowly and steadily marginalised the more they ""fail"" in the roles regarded as requisite for Ideal Womanhood.) 
 The most interesting thing about the book is that Hawkins has made bourgeois women complicit in their sabotage of each other. There is no happy ending of rah-rah sisterhood here, even though the book is told from the point-of-view of three female narrators, with Rachel as the protagonist. The competitiveness between the women, and the way women who have ""won"" the prize of heterosexuality (husband, child, private property) judge women who have ""lost"". Even when the prize turns out to be poison, women are encouraged to be in denial. In another way, then, Rachel's blackouts and her inability to remember what she has seen is also a commentary on how women aren't allowed to have a gaze and to trust it. Or rather, how the gaze is put to use by men in power, how control is gained by making you think you didn't actually see what you saw. It made me think about Nicholas Mirzoeff's essay, ""The Right to Look"": ""The right to look confronts the police who say to us, 'move on, there's nothing to see here'"". (No surprise that in this book the police are not saviours or even remotely interested in justice. I mean, it's not like Paula Hawkins is all ""FTP"" but you know. Rachel is aware she can't expect help or even protection from them.) Rachel insists on the right to look even though society has deemed her a useless, slobby, undesirable drunk who should just get out of the way of everyone else's fun and success and good times. Perhaps this is a common trope in crime fiction featuring ordinary women who become obsessed with solving a crime, especially ones where the victims are women and children: it is an insistence on the right to look. 
 The point about ""unreliable narrators"" is a key factor in what one expects or takes away from the book, I guess. It's about what ""unreliable"" means, especially in the case of Rachel, who's battling depression and addiction. She was the most reliable one of the lot because at some point she decided the truth mattered more than her reputation, her status. Her memories became unreliable because of how men (and the women who love them), as well as the police, discipline her through shaming and insults and contempt, into undermining herself. She is ostracised, increasingly isolated. The others are unreliable because they have something to lose and will do anything to protect their vacuous, bougie lives, and so they lie. This is not to say that Rachel is outside of this or that she did not lie; she wants many of these things, too. The women are alienated from each other through the arena of competitive sexual display; but the women who ""have it all"" are fine with that. It's only when you're on the outside of it that you see the steaming pile of shit for what it is. Of course none of these women are ""nice"". Who the hell can afford to be if they want the things they've been trained to want all their lives and can only acquire it by competing with someone else?"
4,"4 Short and Sweet STARS! 
 Coming off an intense read (Complete Submission and CODA by CD Reiss) I was looking for something light-hearted, and not too long. These stories did the trick!! 
 Remember your first time? Most of us do, for the awkwardness and fumbling... not exactly swoon-worthy either! But what we should remember was the way it felt building up to that moment!!!!! These stories will bring back those feelings of .... intensity, sweetness, passion, anxiety, and the heart-pounding love for another human being!!! It will make you wish you had exactly this type of first time! 
 I started reading and could feel my heart soaring, and smiling along with all these timid, nervous, in-love couples. 
 If I had to pick a favourite, and because M/M genre is one of more favourite genre's to read, Two in the Morning by Roni Loren, absolutely tore at my heart and had it smiling. 
 All the stories were intense. Some had more intimate moments, and others that didn't have sex, but eluded to it, you didn't feel cheated, they all had something sweet. 
 Worthy of the price and your time!!!"
5,"I've read Wicked three or four times now. It's one of those novels that I keep coming back to. Though, admittedly, I need to be in just the right frame of mind to do so. 
 I love the way Maguire tells Elphaba's story. It's this wonderful balance of literature and fantasy--a balance that not many writers can pull off properly. And while the story focuses on Elphaba's life, it also manages to pull in discussions about issues like religion and class differences in a way that seems natural. It doesn't pull you away from the story the way it might in other novels. 
 Admittedly, though, Wicked is a bit of a slower read than most novels. And I have a tendency to slow down when I'm reading it. That would annoy me with some novels, but it doesn't seem to happen with Wicked. But, it is the reason I need to be in just the right frame of mind to pick up the book. I need to be ready to take my time with it. 
 *This recommendation was originally posted on my blog."
4,Well that was certainly interesting! It certainly appealed to the psychologist in me. It is dark and disturbing and sometimes that is just what I'm looking for in a book.
4,"This was not as great as the first book, for it was a little lacking in the spontaneity of it. While it was still a good read (4 stars), I'm waiting for the third book to try to restore me. It had the right amount of surprises, and the moral dilemma of the main character realistic to that of a real person (like, we're not always morally good, which a lot of ya seems to forget). The tension with the love triangle thickened, but it's becoming quite obvious which relationship is going to prevail in the end (I quite enjoyed not having the knowledge in the 1st book). Hopefully, it will continue to dazzle me. (it might not help that I read the book all through one night)"
2,"Thank you for giving me the opportunity to read this. 
 I dont like to give bad reviews as I knowhow hard an author works to create the wonderful world of stories we love to read. But I do believe in giving an honest review. 
 I love the taboo stories. Never read a book where the main characters were 100% siblings before though. But this book was not for me. 
 Its mainly written in flashbacks, which I am not a fan of. Then the story would take a massive jump from one thing to another, leaving me going ""huh"" 
 Example. (Excerpt taken from beginning of page 38. Getting to Know Eachother) 
 ""I'm gonna come..."" he breathed out, as he gripped hold of her hips. 
 ""Faster... fuck me..."" Sarah gasped out, as he made his movements faster at her request. She responded with a loud moan. 
 ""Shh... you're not meant to be in my room."" he whispered to her, placing his hand over her mouth. Moaning into the back of her neck as his orgasm came. 
 ""You broke my ankle chain."" Lilli sighed, holding up the broken silver chain as she rolled over and snuggled up to her brother. ""Trust you to break it though,"" she teased with a frown, pulling the bed sheets up over their legs. 
 I found the constant jumping hard to keep with a good reading flow. I was having to stop, re-read, think huh and carry on. 
 For me if a book is about a taboo subject then it has to go whole hog and really get into the scene. 
 Readers read it for the taboo factor. Well i do. I want the build up, the fighting the attraction, the inevitable caving in, details, lots of details, the guilt over thier actions etc etc etc. All built around a budding romance. 
 All this I felt was lacking. I read to page 22 before I started paragraph jumping, I got to page 45 before I was skimming. After the awkwardly played out love scene on page 56, im sorry but I gave up. 
 I may go back and finish it at some point though. 
 Im not going to compare this author with others out there. Thats unfair. I have read thousands of books over the years and each one is differant in their own right. 
 This book will appeal to some audiences and not to other's. 
 Sorry my review could not be more positive. 
 Keep up the great work you can only get better as your writing grows with you."
5,"I can't believe Fire and Thorns is over; it makes me sad to leave Elisa and company behind. I really enjoyed the other two books in the trilogy, and The Bitter Kingdom met all of my expectations for the final chapter. 
 Nothing new here: I loved the romantic pairings, I still love the main characters, and once again I loved the way royal politics, the non-head-clobbering kind of faith, and adventure intertwined. 
 I don't want to talk too much about the plot in my review; I mean, if you've read and liked the first two books, you're going to read this one anyway, right? I do think Elisa remained a strong, admirable heroine through the conclusion, and I really enjoyed the supporting characters Carson arranged around Elisa in this installment. 
 If I had to nitpick, I'd say there were some slow spots, but nothing that stalled the book for me. There were also a few plot turns that seemed contrived; they may have been necessary so that nothing would be left dangling, but they were a little awkward to read. Regardless, I am fully satisfied with this series, and I think Bitter Kingdom wraps it up nicely. 
 (four-and-a-half stars)"
2,"A good try, but through most of the middle of the book I was bored to death. We have parallel characters, one who's plot moves forward at a turbo speed, the other's is painfully, excruciatingly slow. They come together in the end in a rather predictable way, and then we just need to skim the last few pages to see if it's a happy or sad ending. It's a happy ending for me, because it is the end. 
 When I am... 
 When he is... 
 When one is... 
 Please, just pick a pov and stop messing around. 
 It is very hard to write an exciting story about a boring small town where everything is boring. When your point is ""this is boring,"" you take a risk that your writing will be boring. Mixing up pov does not equal ""exciting,"" it equals ""confusing"" and ""distracting."""
2,"Where do I even start? 
 I bet many of you will like this book. Is has that type of snarky, sarcastic main character who feels real and as if she were telling us her story while simultaneously living it. She's vulnerable and she's strong. She's funny and she's morbid. She's real. 
 But she's very sarcastic and says things that leave a bad taste in my mouth, such as: It's possible I've ingested enough of my own fingers to call myself a cannibal. 
 *shudders* 
 Furthermore, I found the idea of exploring the theme of mental health with agoraphobia quite interesting. (Norah also has OCD.) However, it is extremely reminiscent of Everything, Everything, which is a book I found heartfelt and powerful in themes. 
 They're comparable vis-a-vis the subject (girl cannot leave her home), the romance (neighbour to the rescue), the mother (single and crazy about her daughter) and the way the story unfolds... slowly and heavily on the romance. 
 Sadly, the romance is one of the things I least enjoyed. Don't get me wrong, Luke can be sweet, but he sure isn't realistic. Guys his age (seventeen) don't talk the way he does (like a robot)--or so I think, but it may be me who expected more charm out of him. He's calm and a beautiful listener, but he certainly does not know how to woe a girl. 
 Plus, it just isn't romantic. Norah and Luke's interactions are extremely awkward. I understood that they both had little idea of how to react around each other, but hell, does no teenager nowadays know how to flirt? What. And truly, I got that it was a HUGE deal for Norah to even clasp his hand, but the whole romance felt so anticlimactic, instead of adorable like in Everything, Everything. 
 The writing is one of the things that could have made me up my rating to 3 or 3.5 stars even, because there is nothing I hated about this book (aside form the weird, unexpected, what-the-hell ending). Louisa Gornall has a way with words, I'll give her that. She does... So why is she trying so hard? I swear, every single descriptive paragraph contains a comparison. 
 I'm all for figures of style (and hers are quite imaginative) but that's too much! It takes away from the realisticity of the story (and annoys the reader). 
 It wasn't a chore to read it for me, so do keep that in mind in case you're interested in reading it. If what bothered me will not bother you, it can make for an incredible read!

0,"The hook to this one caught my attention right away. The first line is about nail polish, after all, which you know I love if you pay any attention to my Mad About Nails feature. I was more thrilled than I probably should have been every time Parker painted her nails in the novel, although, wow, that girl paints them a lot. Sometimes more than once a day! Parker seems to have decided that nail polish is the answer to any equation beginning with BOYS, and is trying her hardest to be more girly, but it doesn't come naturally. 
 Parker has been trying to change who she is ever since the fallout that came from her mother announcing that she was gay and moving out. Even though Parker was on the all-star softball team, she quits the sport she once loved. Former friends called her butch and said she was like her mom. She's even shunned at church. Parker decides to be seen with as many boys as possible, because then no one can confuse her with her mother. She becomes the quintessential girly-girl, down to the Bubblegum Pink and Passion Peach nail polish. She even becomes the baseball team's manager. She's not allowed to date the guys on the team, but she can flirt, right? And Brian, the Assistant Coach, isn't that much older than her. What's six years? Besides, he isn't off-limits, though a relationship with him would be frowned upon if anyone found out... Parker's already used to everyone talking about her for things she can't control. Maybe it's time to show everyone that they're right about her by becoming that girl. 
 Parker goes through so much pain and turmoil over the course of STEALING PARKER. She's so hung up on what happened with her mother and allows everyone's words to cut right through her. She becomes the girl everyone says she is, even though she isn't like that at all. She makes some big mistakes and gets into a lot of trouble that could have otherwise been avoided, but she learns and grows. Parker is far from perfect, and I loved seeing her grow up over the course of the novel. She gets away from the stingy Church she grew up in and finds one that's more willing to embrace her for herself. She befriends some guys on the baseball team who truly have her best interests at heart. She learns to trust again, to grow a thicker skin, to embrace things beyond her control. There are so many issues at work in STEALING PARKER; this isn't a traditional breezy romance, though it has that, too, of course. It's about growing up and discovering yourself, about learning from your mistakes. The story and characters will really resonate with teenage readers struggling to make the same discoveries. 
 There is even more emotion and heart than in Kenneally's debut novel, CATCHING JORDAN, and it makes a strong companion novel. You don't need to read the books in order, either, though characters from the first book do make a cameo appearance. I would, however, recommend reading STEALING PARKER before THINGS I CAN'T FORGET because two of the characters come back in a bigger way."
5,"Ok, I have to gather my thoughts now, because this book has blown my mind! I absolutely loved it! This is my first book by Jennifer, but it definitely won't be my last. I will now stalk all of her work - beware! There is no wonder she has been getting rave reviews so far. 
 Obsidian gets us acquainted with Katy, who has just moved to a boring small town in West Virginia, and with not-so-boring Daemon who is the most arrogant human being she has ever met. And, lucky her (seriously! lucky her!), he lives right next door. But at least his sister is great. When Katy finds out they're all aliens, though, her life kind of gets weird... a little. 
 I instantly clicked with Katy- and not just because she is a book blogger even though that was awesome -, I found her to be a lot like me. Her reactions, her emotions, her attitude were all very realistic and I could completely relate to her. I particularly appreciated her reaction to finding out Daemon was an alien. First of all she actually HAD a reaction! Secondly, she questioned it. Much better than the ""Oh so you're a (insert paranormal being here)? That's neat! So...*awkward silence* wanna make out?"" reactions I've too often encountered. I loved her friendship with Dee. I think Dee is a great person and she's absolutely a lot of fun. I was also very happy with Katy's mom. She was down to earth, funny and caring. 
 Daemon, yes, you need your own paragraph. Daemon is very likely going to end up on the top of everyone's ""most sexiest male character"" list. He is definitely on mine! He is irritating, infuriating and downright bullheaded, but holy damn is he ever hot! Daemon is incredibly protective of his sister and others of his race, but even when he was being... difficult, it wasn't without reason. He did love to push Katy's buttons and I mostly found it hilarious (though if I was her I would have punched him in the face). What came out of his mouth actually made me gape with disbelief a few times. Despite his loveable personality, he is an incredible character who fit extremely well with the story, even more-so with Katy, and gave it a very attractive vibe. 
 Together, Daemon and Katy were fantastic. There was enough chemistry between them to give Marie Curie a run for her money! Their relationship was very love/hate. You never knew what Daemon's intentions were from one page to the next and it drove me crazy as much as it did Katy. However, you still couldn't help but adore him to pieces. 
 Now for the plot, I found it was very exciting and well thought out. I really enjoyed Jennifer's take on the aliens in Obsidian: how they got there, their powers, the villains. It reminded me a bit of Smallville but it was still original and incredibly exciting. The book definitely does not lack in action and the climactic ending was completely fulfilling. 
 I really have no negative aspect to mention in regards to this book. It was everything I was hoping for and more than I was expecting. No doubt that Jennifer is the up and coming author to watch out for!"

 ""What have you done to its eyes?!"" From Fantomas to Polanski, much has been lifted from this classic horror book. 
 I'd seen the film a few times and was always surprised at how well it translated into this day and age. I'm a big classic movie buff so I know a lot of what they found ""scary"" back in the day doesn't really scare people anymore. But Rosemary's Baby holds up as a genuinely creepy, suspenseful and disturbing film. 
 And the book? It's exactly the same. Really, Polanski followed Ira Levin's novel to the tiniest detail, so I had no problem at all envisioning all the actors and I could see the apartment and the scene in the laundry room and I could hear the pitch-perfect dialogue. Polanksi also did an excellent job of casting Mia Farrow as Rosemary. I know this isn't a review of the film, but sweet and fiercely determined Rosemary was portrayed so perfectly. 
 This book plays on one of my greatest, well, fears. To be more precise, it casts a shadow of doubt on the protagonist so that no one around her believes her and that even she herself doubts some of the things she's suspecting. Then it takes the few people who could help her and reach out to her and it, um, disposes of them. 
 Feeling all alone, not knowing who to trust...I just can't think of anything worse. 
 Oh wait, yes I can. How about marrying an absolute shit-for-brains, immoral, reprehensible douchebag of a man? Her husband Guy represents the most vile, two-faced, self-absorbed monster I have ever read. I mean it. Sure he's not outright DOING anything (except letting SATAN IMPREGNATE HIS WIFE)but his unbelievable passiveness, selfish, happily ignorant attitude and quick, easy descent into evil just boiled my blood until I was RAGEASAURUS. I was so happy when Rosemary finally caught on that he was the scum of the earth and Satan's little bum buddy, I just wish she had opened her eyes sooner. 
 Overall, I can't find any flaws with this book. The writing was wonderfully descriptive but it only helped to build the scenes. Do we NEED to know that Rosemary grabbed a blue and white colored robe or that Minnie's silk was lime green? No, not really. But I saw the colors in my head and I think Levin's use of color helped to create a subconcious foundation for the events to come. 
 Perhaps not everyone will like this book...the ending is as vague and completely frustrating as the film's. There is resolution, just not the one you'd want. But I think Levin was wise to stick to his guns, play on the ferocity of a mother's instinct, and let the end be what it is: memorable."
5,Loved this book! Read it!
2,"I am sad to say I actually couldn't even finish the book. Jennifer Lawrence you have let me down. This book is dull and vaguely reminiscent of Perks of being a wallflower where the protagonist's internal voice sounds like a six year old. 
 Parts of it were hard to believe, he really didn't know he was their for years? BULLSHIT! He would of fucking aged. 
 Tiffany was the shiny light of the novel, she brought comedy and actually seemed like a mentally unstable person rather than how pat seemed to be what people think mentally disabled people are like. He had bipolar, that doesn't make you think like a 6 year old. However Tiffany was barely their and she had a weird dirty old lady feel to her in the book which was unpleasant and the letters were stupid. 
 Also Pats mum is a bitch in the book. Well up to where I read. 
 DON'T BOTHER READING, JUST GO SEE THE MOVIE! 
 You'll thank me later."
5,"I will not be afraid. For the first time in a while, the words felt true. 
 This is probably about the fourth or fifth time that I have read this book and I am JUST NOW getting around to reviewing it. Honestly I am kind of glad for that, though, because having read it this last time after the craziness that was Queen of Shadows, there are so many things that I have picked up on this past time around. So many little clues for the upcoming books and so much heartbreak when I realize that what was in this book, isn't what is by book four. And that's alright. I have adjusted and know that if I ever need a certain fix, I can come back to these books and feign ignorance if only for a little while. 
 He found her beautiful, if not a big strange and sour. It was something in the way that her eyes sparked when she looked at something lovely in the landscape. He couldn't understand it. 
 This is a series that I wish I could back with and start from the beginning, without knowing what happens in books two through four. This is a series that, no matter how old I get, will leave me speechless time and again. It also might have one of the craziest fan bases. Let's be real, people either love or hate these books, the characters, and even Maas' writing. My ship of ships, my OTP CRASHED and BURNED and I still love this series. That has got to count for something! Right..? 
 Still the image haunted his dreams throughout the night: a lovely girl gazing at the stars, and the stars who gazed back. 
 When we first start this journey, we are introduced to Celaena, a supposedly renown assassin of Adarlan who has spent the past year in a salt mine (essentially a slave/prison camp). The crown prince, Dorian, and his best friend who also happens to be head of the King's guard (and the light of my life) show up and take her out of that hell hole so that she can compete in a tournament to become King's champion. Celaena is pretty messed up from having spent so much time there but it hasn't fully broken her spirit. Once they reach the castle she slowly but surely regains her strength and sanity back. 
 One of my main peeves about people's complaints with this series is how they view Celaena. FIRST of all I think it is essential that people read all of the novellas first. I think those give some vital information that we don't have access to in this first book. We see her as the assassin that she once was, we see her freeing slaves, we see her falling in love for the first time, and finally--we see that good ripped from her life in the worst fucking way possible. Then, in this book, she is at the lowest of all lows when we first meet her and when she is taken from that camp, she gets a second chance at life. And yet, when she shows signs of being a girly girl, people FREAK OUT. First of all, yo, she's an eighteen-year-old girl and was used to living a very extravagant lifestyle. I think she is entitled to loving her dresses and her candy. Second of all, SHE IS A RENOWN ASSASSIN, DON'T YOU THINK SHE COULD BE ACTING LIKE THAT ON PURPOSE?! Not everyone knows who she truly is and even those who know she goes by the name ""Celaena Sardothian"" don't know everything or what she has gone through. No. I love Celaena through and through. 
 ""Guards are of no use in a library."" Oh, how wrong he was! Libraries were full of ideas--perhaps the most dangerous and powerful of all weapons. 
 Chaol: Chaol is going to be, hands down, the hardest part about re-reading this series. Every single damn time. I want to shout it from the rooftops: I AM CHAOLAENA SHIPPER. For life. No one can convince me I'm wrong, even though I accept where things have progressed. Chaol is this book is my favorite. Having re-read it after all this time, it's honestly hard for me to see how people could have thought that Dorian and her were endgame. Don't get me wrong, I love Dorian, but Celaena and Chaol form an actual bond and friendship. He may like to kick her ass in practice and is always gruff, but there are SO many moments where we get to see his true feelings shine. UGH HE IS THE BEST. He truly is a cinnamon roll, too good for this earth. 
 She used to play--oh, she'd loved to play, loved music, the way music could break and heal and make everything seem possible and heroic. 
 Dorian: Reading Throne of Glass Dorian and knowing the kinds of things that he will be going through is a pretty crazy thing. It's almost relaxing reading these first few books before all hell breaks loose. They are still relatively (ish) carefree and all Dorian really cares about is how in love he is with Celaena. Now, as you have all read in the paragraph above, I never shipped Dorian and Celaena. Not even the first time I read this. However, I did truly enjoy reading about their puppy love and banter. I think that it was needed in order for Dorian to start becoming the man that he becomes by book four, truly. I really wish there was a whole novella centered around Dorian, Chaol, and Celaena off on a silly adventure together. Pure fluff is what Dorian is (at first). 
 ""Courage of heart is very rare,"" she said with sudden calm. ""Let it guide you."" 
 Nehemia: Ughhhhh. Okay even though I love Nehemia and the friendship that she brings Celaena, I can't help but be pissed at her, just knowing what it is that I know. Those of you who have read the rest of the series know. Even then, I GET it. I do. Celaena wouldn't have gotten her act together for the greater good if the terrible THING wouldn't have happened. Still though. It was such a horrible thing that she orchestrated and I just wish things could have happened differently. 
 She kissed him, hoping to steal some of his air. 
 Amazing characters aside, this whole series has got some series world building and engaging writing that help make it so highly ranked in my book. I say engaging writing because I still hold to the fact that Maas' writing isn't the best I have ever read BUT..but I have also never had any other book suck me in like these do. OMG like the love scenes give me legit butterflies, the war and fighting sometimes make me feel physically ill--it's insane in the best way possible. And even though these books are based on a whole new continent with all new lands and people that we are not familiar with at first, I have no problems picturing it. With some fantasy novels I do, and I hate it. Sometimes you don't get a feel for a place until book three or four. With this series, even though we aren't introduced to all of them just yet, you catch a good enough glimmer that holds you over until you are actually reading about a character in that country. I never found any of it lacking. And, like I mentioned earlier, if there ever was anything that seemed obscure or strange, it's only because Maas was setting up for later books. Going back and reading this after reading book four, I caught every single little clue and had so many ""aha!"" moments. It was insane. I am SO READY for Empire of Storms. Bring it on, Maas. I'm waiting. 
 ""Celaena,"" he breathed, his voice laced with pain--and hope. This was all she had left--his outstretched hand, and the promise of hope, of something better waiting on the other side of that line. 
 Moving her arm made sparks dance before her eyes, but she extended it until her fingertips reached the line of chald, and stayed there, not a quarter of an inch from Chaol, the thick white mark separating them. 
 She lifted her eyes to his face, and found his gaze lined with silver. ""Get up,"" was all he said. 
 And in that moment, somehow his face was the only thing that mattered. 
 **ALSO--CAN WE TALK ABOUT CELAENA ASKING NEHEMIA ABOUT TRAVELING TO OTHER WORLDS THROUGH A WYRDGATE AND NEHEMIA NOT GIVING A SOLID ""NO"" ANSWER??!?!? UMMMMMM crossover plz? 
 ""You could rattle the stars,"" she whispered. ""You could do anything, if only you dared. And deep down, you know it, too. That's what scares you the most."""
4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 wow. So Celaena is the lost queen of Terrasan and part fae. That's why she was chosen to be the one to bring peace and whatnot. Now she's going to where her fae family will be in order to kill the king and queen of wendlyn, and if she doesn't then the king, Dorian's father, will kill Chaol. Chaol now knows pretty much everything including about the whyrkeys and hopefully he can figure out if the King has just the one or if he has two. Also hopefully they can figure out where the 3rd one is. Just fyi, She totally belongs with Chaol but I still love Dorian. It was sad about Nehemia but her death caused things to move forward so it wasn't in vain. So now Celaena has another name Aelin Galathynius, great grandaughter of the fae queen Mab. Crazy!"
4,"That ending... This book was simply amazing. 
 The only thing that I didn't like about this book was the romance, and the repetition that occurred in the first 120 pages. After finishing the book, I understood why Suzanne Young wrote those scenes, and I loved that she did. 
 The idea for The Program was actually quite brilliant, but also a bit frightening. This book is not a dystopia, it's more or less the exact same government that we have today. It's scary that something as horrible as suicide could become an even bigger issue than it is right now, so much so that something like this has to happen. The fact that it could happen in a mere 20-30 years from now is also so mind-blowing. I swear, if anything like The Program comes into society, I will never let anyone send anybody there. I loved to hate the ""cure"".

2,"Oh boy. Why do I write shitty reviews for books I get for free? 
 Because I'm a crusader for candor, my ducklings. I do it for you. 
 This review may trigger some people, as the novel deals heavily with abuse and I'm going to be wildly candid about the subject, and the author's failings with the subject. 
 This book is a love story between the world's most well-rounded abuse victim and a really hot rich guy with no problems. It really should be two different books. A gritty, pseudo-memoir of abuse and family problems, and a quirky love story of that awkward girl and that hot guy. You know. Every New Adult book released in the last three years. 
 What we get is a fully formed...neither. Neither of these things are properly flushed out. The abuse is handled like our narrator is, in all honesty, special needs, and the romance is slapped on, strained to death for tension, and really fucking stupid. No teenage boy is resilient enough to withstand that many mixed signals. I'm sorry. They just don't. I don't pull even half the shit Emma does and all the guys I've hooked up with are still screening my calls. Sorry, what? I didn't say anything. 
 But perfect teenage boy is perfect and her savior and emotionally supportive and romantic and athletic and smart and handsome and talented at everything ever. Ever. 
 Where are you finding these guys, YA fiction? Where are they? Should I have not cut so many classes in High School? Should I have participated in more clubs instead of hooking up with my friends' boyfriends? 
 Evan is almost sexist in his portrayal. He's not a human. He's the emotional equivalent of a Victoria's Secret Ad: sexy, unattainable, edited as hell to be a completely unrealistic ideal. 
 And despite Emma's fervent rejections, he just doesn't give her any privacy. I'm an incredibly private, kind of openly obscene person. But I keep my personal shit under wraps. So his invasive personality was more of a trigger than anything else in this book. 
 I'm going to say something horrible: Emma gets snuck up on way too much for someone going through abuse. Her reflexes are way too dull. 
 There, I said it. It's awful that I know this, but honestly, the fact she doesn't sense the abuser in the room...I'm calling bullshit. Sorry. Them's the rules. The fact she's humming to herself, oblivious, while her back is completely unguarded...god I hate that I know this... it's not a realistic place to be. Years of abuse would have sharpened her senses. 
 Here's my problem, Emma is too normal. She is too smart, functional, and completely un-fucked up. Yes, she has social problems, but it's played off as an inconvenience instead of a complete emotional deficiency. She mostly comes across as a total bitch. But not in an emotionally damaged way. Her coldness seems more rooted in being spoiled, which doesn't really match up with anything in her life. Emma has no interests, only behaviors. She's boring. We have nothing to connect with her with, only our pity for her. She's too resigned to the abuse, and closed off to the rest of the world. She honestly puts up with way too much. The first time the bat gets brought out was a line that shouldn't have been crossed without consequences for Carol. 
 Also, the abuser has no depth, no humanity, nothing. So you have no motivation to have this bitch not imprisoned from chapter 1. I don't give a shit about the young, happy, impressionable kids. She was too selfless, it made her seem masochistic, or stupid. Emma should know how hard it is adjusting as a teenager, giving them a chance to move on while they're young and adaptable is the best gift she could give them. 
 The biggest middle finger is when Emma seemingly dies in the epilogue of the book. The last chapter is her strangulation, caused by to be quite honest, her own stupidity. Of course this if the first book in a trilogy (really? Was that really necessary?), but let's say this book never got a sequel. Say this is where Emma's story ended. (It's where it ends for me, because I have no fucks to give). She had the chance to leave, even stay the night with a friend, and instead gets tied up and strangled by the aunt. STUPID. Emma has no survival instincts. Katniss Everdeen would have her dead halfway to the cornucopia. This is what you have to appreciate in a character raised in abuse: they typically are tougher and self-reliant. Emma needs her friends, or her boyfriend, and can't function enough to just get out. 
 This book...makes the abuse victim as helpless as the abuser wants them to be. It's offensive how Emma literally lies there like a corpse and doesn't fight back. She plays three fucking varsity sports, push her off, show George the bruises Carol left, and take care of it that way. Jesus."

5,"This review first appeared on I Heart Romance & YA 
 I have to really honest about this book, Illuminae by Amie Kaufman & Jay Kristoff and admit that it took me a while to finish reading it. And as much as I loved it, and was blown away by it, I still had a hard time getting into the book. In fact, this is the first book that I read in this format because I thought, hey, I wouldn't be interested in reading a book in email or chat form. 
 What makes the book so unique? 
 Let's start with the format. The book is written in hacked format form - emails, surveillance incident reports, unique ASCII, chats, interviews, and just unique formatting all in all. I mean, there's also a page that is akin to our Wikipedia! And a two pager with the images of the casualties of war (so sad). 
 So yes, it took a while for me to get into it, but I finally did when I obtained the audiobook format.

5,"Chief Inspector Gamache is in Quebec visiting a retired mentor and recovering from a terrible trauma and as he is walking down the street, police cars surround a site containing a dead body . . . . . 
 While the 4 plot lines were a bit much, they actually held my attention, and were reasonably worked into the point of the story to the point of being less grating to me than the numerous over-the-top implausible situations of the 4th book. I liked this book the best of all in this series so far. >>Make sure your read the previous book, The Brutal Telling, before you read this one. (Ideally read all except for maybe the 4th in the series.) I loved the history, the poetic descriptions, the English librarian trying to speak French was an ingenious touch of humor juxtaposed into serious situations for maximum effect and the sudden shocker (not Champlain's situation) toward the end got to me. Watch the movie Incendies(2010), first, for maximum effect on that. 
 I really enjoyed the character development. A detraction is the common Penny incongruity I find in all her books: the writing in a number of the books pulls you into the seriousness of a murder, sometimes in a small town of someone of no national consequence, as it becomes intertwined with some deep psychology of Gamache and other characters, while the murderer him/herself never has a compelling psychological reason for committing the crime. This always leaves me with a disconcerting letdown and distancing at the end of her novels and the shocker near the end would have been even more gut wrenching if the novel provided this. Ms. Penny: why not delve also into the mind of the murderer to make the stories more compelling and believable?"
2,The last 5 pages were good. Everything else was crap. Doubt I'll continue the series.
3,"Heinlein, argh. 
 Much, much later with one star added. I think John Scalzi is an awesome, awesome blogger. So I wish I'd liked this book more, but alas, aforesaid Heinlein issues. However I'm going to give Scalzi's novels another chance, also possibly because he may have been sending up Heinlein and it went whooshing over my head. And it's a new day here at Goodreads with a new policy about not discussing authors or sumfin'. Frankly I'm a little curious about what happens if I say in a review John Scalzi is a really really great guy, a terrific human being, a Brilliantly Behaving Author."
5,"Irresistible sexual tension, explosive chemistry, swoon-worthy romance-- 
 Loliver's story has it ALL. Wildly fun to read. 
 Loliver!!! This may be my favorite Christina Lauren novel yet--Lola and Oliver's story sizzles with a geeky, endearing, irresistible charm. Their amazing connection comes alive on the page, making it wickedly, wildly and wonderfully fun to read. 
 There are so many elements I loved about the novel. That they were such amazing friends. That they were brilliantly geeky. That there was tremendous honesty between them. All those elements combined made their story feel special and fresh and remarkable. 
 Lola and Oliver met and married in Vegas, as did the rest of their crew. Whereas the others holed up in a room, however, Lola and Oliver talked for hours, establishing the foundation of what would be an enviable friendship. As that night came to a close and desires braved mentioning, practicality prevailed and they departed as soon-to-be-annulled exes. 
 ""Oliver is both my former husband and my current crush, but it will forever remain unrequited: our marriage was never really a marriage. It was that-thing-we-did-in-Vegas."" 
 As close as they are, their hidden feelings intensify day by day, each yearning for the other. Oliver is busy running his comic book store and Lola's career takes off as her book tops the charts and gets optioned for a movie. As war rages inside, each wonders whether taking the step and voicing their feelings could ruin it all. 
 But one wild night, truths tumble out and the hunger for each other becomes uncontrollable. Their chemistry is explosive. Oliver (who quickly became one of my favorite book heroes ever) is refreshingly honest and caring. Their relationship is so right, so perfect, and while it seems inevitable and impermeable, it's also dangerously fragile. 
 ""I can't mess this up, Oliver. This is huge to me. I know enough to know it doesn't happen ever day, and I will be sick if I mess it up."" 
 And break it does. Lola's fears get in the way. Work dominates. Insecurities consume. Hearts get broken. Lola and Oliver must find a way back to each other, tackling deep-seated issues in order to be happy. 
 This book just had it all. The Wild Seasons trilogy continues to get better and better. Because when it comes to sexual tension that keeps you furiously flipping pages, no one does it quite like this talented duo of authors. I love their characters, their edgy and unique stories, the scorching sexiness, and of course, their sharp, infectious wit. Read this book!

3,"In the midst of World War II, young David is mourning the death of his mother. Withdrawing from family and friends, he notices that the books in his bedroom have begun whispering to him, late at night as he lies in the dark in his sleepless bed. Soon fantasy takes a more active role, and he is catapulted into the midst of an otherworld that comprises a mixture of various classic fantasyland precursors (the snow-and-wolves theme of Narnia's early stages, for example). He is, natch, a chosen one of sorts here; he must quest to the castle of the dying king to retrieve the volume called The Book of Lost Things. Various humans and nonhumans aid and befriend him along the way, although most of the world seems out to get him; his recurring foe is the sinister Crooked Man, ye5t even he might not be so antagonistic to David's aims as he seems . . . 
 This is for the most part extremely jolly stuff, conveying something of the affect of the original English and European fairytales before the Victorians came along and stripped out all the good bits -- the blood and the sex. It is not, despite the age of its protagonist, a children's book. And it's not without its teeth. There's a powerful passage towards the end where the Crooked Man, of all people, argues strongly against our reflexive reaction that we should always return home from our forays into fantasylands, that the real world is the place we ought to be. Here are this longish passage's first few lines: 
 Listen to me. [. . .:] Let me tell you the truth about the world to which you so desperately want to return. It is a place of pain and suffering and grief. When you left it, cities were being attacked. Women and children were being blasted to pieces or burned alive by bombs dropped from planes flown by men with wives and children of their own. People were being dragged from their homes and shot in the street. Your world is tearing itself apart, and the most amusing thing of all is that it was little better before the war started. [. . .:] 
 And, the reader inevitably adds, it is little better now. 
 Yet there are doldrums in the tale too, as if Connolly experienced a few periods where inspiration deserted him but he kept on churning out the words anyway, then later lacked the ruthlessness to slice them out again. By far the worst of these is where David encounters analogues of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs; the latter form an autonomous collective that's a straight pinch from Monty Python and the Holy Grail, complete with Eric Idle's accent. I very nearly threw the book at the wall at this stage; later, I was glad enough that I'd persevered. 
 I read this book some months ago (the bookmark I left in it is covered in notes I scribbled to myself while writing my novella The Lonely Hunter [forthcoming Fall 2010 from PS Publishing, folks!:]). By strange coincidence I'm currently reading Brian Hall's The Saskiad (1997), a book with a remarkably similar initial premise yet an absolutely different development. It is certainly the case that The Book of Lost Things loses in the comparison between the two (at least, so far as I've got through The Saskiad), but overall it's a pretty damn' fine book in its own right."
5,"Happy to read a YA book that has kids with good relationships with their caregivers. While this book deals with bullying and the changes it inflicts on ones personality and behaviour, it also deals with domestic violence and first love (in a way), as well as coming of age. This book would be a great discussion starter for race/class issues, domestic violence and bullying, as well as cultural observations of this small group of NYC living latino(a)s. I felt like the ending was a tad abrupt, but the ends were tied as nicely as anyone could do them. I'd totally read a sequel to this book as Meg Medina makes you care about the characters and their well being. The title totally has the word ""ass"" in it, sure, but that's about as controversial as it gets, besides one quick sentence that mentions sex."
4,"I've been wanting to read Simon's story ever since I read Fangirl! I really liked this one, especially all the ""spells"" and how a saying could become a spell. That was basically my favourite part, and I have a lot of favourite parts. This reminds me so much of Harry Potter, but at the same time they are two completely different things. The main difference being that there are really no bad guys, everyone is just trying to do good. With varying results."
3,"2.75 stars 
 This book, rather this series did not make me feel much. 
 So the starting of the book. First, how come an entire regime just crumbles without anyone fighting back? I read somewhere in the blurb of the book 'Condie doesn't waste time getting to the action'. Uh,one question? Where was the action? And this is coming from the person who won't be counted in top million fans of action, anytime soon. [Last million, maybe. Hey still a fan :P]. 
 Then there is huge wastage of a dystopian platform. I mean apart from people not being allowed to create, how exactly did the author dear use the world-change? I mean going the less traveled road is one thing, a waste of potential another. And they didn't even have a President Snow (The Hunger Games). :3 
 And of course, the names. The society is called the Society, the rising is called the Rising and the Pilot is, wait for it, a pilot. Nothing's wrong with simplicity, but still. (Inside joke, refer to Last Sacrifice's Rose). 
 All in all, I guess my main issue with the series was the anti-climatic happenings of it all."

 When I read what happened, I couldn't believe it, I immediately thought it was unnecessary drama. I was so sad. But the epilogue and Caleb's lyrics made me changed my mind. Now I see why Cassia Leo chose this path for her book.. And I respect it. It's a beautiful ending !

4,"I promised Chris that I would read this book as it is one of her favorites. I probably would have skipped this one, but she's convinced me that it has merit. 
 So far so good. 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book, although I'm afraid I've disappointed Chris in that I didn't breeze through it or burst out in tears at the end. 
 None of the time travel conundrums that appeared in the book were new to a veteran sci-fi reader such as myself, but the beauty of this novel is its unwavering dedication to exploring the emotional consequences that time travel has on both the traveler and the one who loves him. The repeated references to Odysseus and Peneloope are quite appropriate. 
 My one niggle that lasted from the beginning of the book to the very end is that Clare never seemed like a real person to me. She feels idealized, the sort of figure that I suspect some of the female readership would like to see themselves as, rather than a living breathing warts and all character that I could imagine bumping into on the street. Of course, this idealization likely makes the book even more popular with some folk, but not so much with me."

 I prepared myself that I might hate some of the characters in this book. I think you have to have a certain mindset when reading books with sensitive issues. Anyway, did I get the angst fest that I want? I sure did. :) 
 From the blurb we already know that Nate and Sadie used to have the perfect marriage where Nate worshipped his wife. What would cause him to do a total 180? In order to understand the characters you need to pay attention to their background and their personality. 
 Was Sadie selfish and self-centered? I believe she was to a certain extent, but she is generous to the ones she loves and I think Nate had enabled her, because making her happy made him happy. But something happened that he suddenly withdrew from her. Sadie had a history of an unstable family life and she had built walls, but Nate broke down those walls and made her trust in their relationship so him behaving differently took away that security leaving her lost and lonely and unsure of their seven years of marriage. 
 Enter Finn. Her sexy neighbor and a shoulder to cry on. I alternately liked and disliked Finn's character. He had his own issues. 
 This book is told through Sadie's POV, and I can see why because the reader is left guessing throughout the book as to why Nate is suddenly acting like an asshole. There were really some shitty things he said and did to Sadie that I could almost say I didn't blame her for finding solace and comfort in another man. 
 Almost. My personal feelings -- despite how difficult your marriage is, it had only been a few weeks. Now if Nate had checked out of their marriage for more than a year, then maybe separate. 
 However, my personal feelings aside I must say Finn was a big temptation, so to enjoy the book, I went with the flow. 
 The sex scenes were super steamy. 
 There were some parts that were slow and I really got impatient for Nate to finally reveal the reason for his actions. Was he cheating or was it something else? Also, Sadie's indecision drove me crazy, but I guess that's part of the angst. :) 
 Some might say Nate was weak and he was responsible for making Sadie that way. But the thing with him, he had a good soul. He finds happiness in volunteering in the soup kitchen. Sadie said that Nate believes that everyone is inherently good. Nate was selfless, so I understand how he would put the person he loved the most on a pedestal. But everyone has their breaking point and it leaves them questioning if they deserved more. 
 Why not five stars? The ending was easily resolved. Who will Sadie pick in the end? Or will she pick no one. I hated Sadie for her indecision, but I can't say I blame her because I can't decide who I liked more either, Finn or Nate? :)"
5,"What do other people's opinions matter compared to your own? We're all different, thus, I feel fine with saying this book was beautiful. 
 This book is infamous for its incest. In fact, the reason I picked it up was because I heard, and I quote, that it was ""about a brother and sister who get locked in the attic and start having sex"". Yet, if you actually peruse the book, you'll find there's several moments of sexual tension but only one actual sex scene. People are overdramatic. 
 Some people are just disgusted after reading the book. They can't get over the incestuous taboo because it's so ingrained in them. For an open mind like mine, however, it was easy to overcome that and really get myself thinking. What Cathy and Chris had together wasn't disgusting, it was tragic. If an adolescent girl or boy are locked up in an attic together, growing up with no outlet for their sexuality unlike other kids their age, something is going to happen. But it wasn't just lust that drove Cathy and Chris to do what they did. They spent years actually BEING the mother and father to their younger siblings, Cory and Carrie. In their roles, they came to actually love each other, because they weren't living as a brother and sister...they were living as husband and wife. I could feel that. Thus, Flowers in the Attic got me past the social stigma with the way it was written, just as Lolita's beauteous prose had me feeling far from disgust for the pedophilic relationship described. 
 Also, can I speak about Chris for a moment? I love Christopher. He's the only character from a book I've ever fallen for. Imaginative, yet intelligent and pratical...caring, fatherly, husbandly...After reading the Andrews books, I told myself I would name one of my sons Christopher when that time came. 
 You know you're reading something amazing when an author can get you to think differently, to change your mind over something so great. V.C. Andrews did that in this book. She also managed to get me emotionally invested. I felt horror at what the children had to go through, the tarring, the whipping, what happened to poor, poor Cory... 
 I wish the incestuous aspect to this book hadn't leaked out so people wouldn't read it just for shock value or make criticisms on it without even reading it (I have a friend who insists it's a disgusting book, yet she's never even read it to make that judgment rightfully!) But then, if it hadn't, the books still wouldn't be around today. 
 I've read the whole Dollanganger series, three of the Casteel series, and several other V.C. Andrews books. Only Flowers in the Attic, Petals on the Wind, and My Sweet Audrina have captured me. The stories are so different from anything I've ever read that it's refreshing. I thank Andrews for this, too."

5,Maybe 4.5 stars but I couldn't put this book down so I went ahead and gave it the full 5 stars.
4,"I'm not a big fan of steampunk -it seems more about the Victorian costumes than anything else - but I really enjoyed Westerfeld's steampunky take on the start of World War I. The concept of a living zeppelin, with its own ecosystem, was great."
0,"I just couldn't get into the book.. 
 The writing was okay, and the characters were a little stupid. 
 _____________ 
 I probably might revisit it later and give it another shot."
5,"Oh. My. God. 
 This is one of the hottest books I've read in a long time. Talk about dirty, dirty smut. And the best part? The romance wasn't lost in translation. I loved how in love the guys were with each other and how they genuinely wanted to find the woman who would complete their triumvirate. This isn't the typical menage where the men both love one woman, but are hands off with each other. The fact that the guys are in love with each other AND individually fall in love with their girl gives the romance so much more depth. Polyamorous relationships in this sense are amazing!! I want to read more books like this. More more more!! 
 This was my first by Jade West and won't be my last...in fact, I've already clicked her backlist. Can't wait to dig in! 
 Five stars and Five Plus Wet Panties. 
 READER BEWARE: the smutty goodness has a fetish... these kinky boys want to stuff their lady's kitty cat with both their man meat at once. It took me out of my comfort zone, but man did it end up being hot. I'm apparently a kinky book whore. (Okay I already knew that, but this is a new kink for me!)"
2,"Initially I was super excited about this book. Like crazy. OMG fantasy mixed in with romance type of crazy. And it was good. Just not as good as I was expecting. But it made me happy and the ending was huge so here we go. 
 The Plot: Hmm yeah cool stuff happening. Rachel, our main character, has just lost her courier father, he is presumed dead after not returning from a mission. Her guardianship (women have like no rights, they need an escort to even go for a walk, seriously) then transfers to her father's apprentice, Logan, a man she once loved, now hates (not really). She decides to go find her father and the mysterious package he was carrying with or without Logan, and with the threat of the Commander (super evil) looming over her. Pretty straightforward premise I think. Just one thing. When and where the heck is this happening? There was no worldbuilding at all. None whatsoever. I didn't know if this was after our modern civilization post-apocalypse, or a completely different world, or a kind of steampunky (they had tech) historical dystopian earth. It was bizarre. And it took away from the book. 
 The Characters: 
 Rachel Adams: Headstrong, feisty, red-haired Rachel was initially fun to read. She made a lot of stupid decisions along the way though. And then she just became plain scary. I guess in a slightly good way because I couldn't stop reading about this crazy, revengeful girl-thing she becomes, but she really changes and not really in a good way. More like an ohmygod that's chilling kind of way. 
 Logan McEntire: A nerd who can fight. He's intelligent, especially with technology; he has a dark past so he can kick-butt. However, he is really overbearing. Blah at first, then kind of protective and endearing. I'm glad he is reminded women are his equals because at first he doesn't tell Rachel anything as if she's too stupid. Blah once more. But he's cute I guess. 
 The Commander: Whoa, evil alert. Especially with the suppress all women agenda and kill them if they walk in the street alone. Seriously, Logan's mother....so sad. That doesn't count as a spoiler does it? Anyway, yeah. He was awesome to hate. I hated him a lot. 
 The Romance: Hmm now this was...what's the word....hurried? It was also a little peculiar. A few years ago, Rachel swears her love to Logan....he rejects her. Okay, so now she hates him right? She is forced to live with him after her father dies, and all Logan does is nothing right? But no, now they must fall in love, this time with Logan falling back and being all ""I will let nothing hurt you Rachel!"" But seriously, it just happened too fast! I wanted more hate, more denial, more angst! It wasn't satisfying... 
 Overall: There were goods and bads I guess. The creatures were interesting, the Commander and his regime were also fascinating. The premise drew me in easily and I enjoyed reading it because of the dual POV's even without any background. It was fun seeing what was happening in both of their heads. But it wasn't as awesome as I had hoped it would be and that's my final judgment."
4,"This one was heading straight for five stars--I was enjoying it so much in the beginning. But I had to ""ding"" it one star for the protagonist's tiresome and repeated focus on women's hair, legs, asses, skin, lips, etc. etc. etc. Okay, we get it: Judd Foxman's ""hot,"" out-of-his-league wife cheated on him; he is now horny and tempted by women at every turn. But his adolescent breed of sexism became grating and insulting after awhile. I don't think there was a single time Judd spoke about a woman when he didn't objectify her in these trifling terms. 
 Other than that, This is Where I Leave You is an engaging, fun read about a dysfunctional family sitting shiva after the death of the family patriarch."
5,"It has been over a week and I am still drowning in my book hangover. 
 Review to come when I can handle it better. 
 And maybe after my hard copies have arrived.. and I've broken them in.... 
 ""For a moment Neil felt trapped, stuck between what he wanted and what he needed, what he'd never have or be and what he wanted but couldn't keep."" 
 -- 
 So I have read this book 4 times since April this year. 
 And I could literally pick it up and read it again at any point. 
 ""Don't look at me like that. I am not your answer, and you sure as fuck aren't mine."" 
 I just adore the foxes and their loyalty, the fierce way they band together and don't let life break them. 
 I love Neil and his unique way of observing things, the way he cuts past the bullshit and sees beneath what people want him to see. 
 I am obsessed with Andrew Joseph Minyard, who is the most real character I have ever read, simply because he does not give enough shits to pretend. Ever. And how he does these tiny things with indifference, so if you're not looking, you'd miss the fact that he cares. And, you know, he'd deny it. 
 I love their tentative relationship, both holding back because they have been hurt too many times to think that anything can last. 
 ""But I'm more afraid of letting go than I am of holding on."""
5,"Review originally posted on Book To Book Reviews 
 And I thought I loved Pushing The Limits... 
 If you have read Pushing The Limits, and you liked it, then you need to read this book...this book is better than the first. At least in my opinion it is. 
 I had always liked Beth's character, there's just something about her character that appeals to me. The damaged character. I don't know why, maybe because that's what I see as realistic. A damaged, flawed and afraid person. And so getting to know Beth's character in this book, I liked that. It made me see why she was damaged, helped me understand her character more. Beth was probably my favourite character in this book. 
 Ryan, hmm... I did quite like Ryan's character. A jock that isn't just dumb for once. I liked how... persistent Ryan was. And how he saw things for what they were...most of the time. He was a great character. 
 All of the character's were great, the plot and the whole book was great. I wish we could have seen more of Noah, Echo, and Isaiah. 
 Whether you have read Pushing The Limits (and if you haven't, you should) or not I recommend this book to you. I can't wait for Isaiah's story next. And I will definitely be buying myself a copy of this book when it gets published. It's one I could reread."
4,"It is such an adorable book, and great if you are looking for an easy read. 
 I loved Alice's character; she's so quirky, and weird, and lovable."
2,"Review: 
 Actual rating: 2.5 Did-I-Really-Consent-To-Read-This stars. No story spoilers. 
 Oh boy...where, oh where do I begin?! 
 Let me backtrack a bit here. Many years back, I'd somehow gotten out of my love affair with reading. WAIT...before you start yelling at me, allow me to explain myself. I loved books as a kid, then became an asshat of a teenager, then was in college and nursing school, then working full time in my new RN career while also going to school full time. So. Books fell to the wayside. I became friends with one of my now best friends (she was my Maid of Honor). She told me I needed to read these books, and leant them to me. (Thank you, Lisa, for getting me back into reading!!!) They were the Mortal Instruments books, back when it was a trilogy. Lisa was right, I did love them!!! I fell head over heels. You know that feeling...when you're swallowed up by a world. When you go to sleep thinking about the book. When you wake up excited to read it. When every moment of the day you aren't reading you spend thinking about and pining for the time you can read again. When you close the book that last time and feel the deepest sadness you have ever felt. THAT is what those books did to me. I was enamored. When I discovered she was writing three more, I thought I was going to die of excitement. I read the fourth and fifth as they were released. And I wasn't ready to admit to myself that they were less than stellar. Then...I made a grave mistake...I decided to reread the series... 
 I reeeeeeally shouldn't have done that. It turned me off so much to the series. I don't know what it was. Maybe I'd read too many well written books and her flaws stood out more to me. I wasn't able to look past them anymore. So. I said screw her, and chose not to finish the series. It's sad really. Because I love the world. The concept is fun. The characters are somewhat annoying, but I enjoy them still. 
 My best friend was reading this series. And I was having fun watching her love it. I was jealous of how much she was enjoying it. I remembered feeling that excitement, and I wanted it again. I told her I would read the final installment with her when she got to it. I read recaps of the other books since it'd been years since I'd read them. I was able to pick right up where it'd left off. 
 Are you still with me here? I'm sorry if I'm boring you. Those of you that have known me for a while know how long it's been since I've written a REAL review. So just be happy I'm writing anything haha. 
 So...back to this book... Well, it pretty much sucked. More of the same happened. Every book is the same really. Jace is troubled. Clary loves Jace. Clary wants to help Jace. Simon wants Isabelle. Isabelle is too busy being pretty. Alec is all somber constantly. Then ERMAHGERD the world is going to end if this group of misfit teenagers don't save it!!!! 
 I'm so sure... Ugh. It just annoys me to even think about it. 
 You're probably wondering the same thing my husband is right now: why did I continue to read it with what I've just said? Well, I didn't hate it totally. I like the world, as I've said. And part of me just really, really, really wanted to know how she'd wrap up this seemingly unending merry-go-round of a story. So. There's that. I may pick up the spin off series she's started, but the jury is out on that still."
4,"Of all the women whom I have ever known, she, the outwardly calm, the ever-placid Ligeia, was the most violently a prey to the tumultuous vultures of stern passion. 
 Even though Ligeia is well within familiar territory for Poe (there is the eerie and gloomy scenery, the misterious muse who is counting her minutes left, and the main character whose twisted mind you get to know) it still manages to stand out as a unique and wonderfully crafted story due to Poe's magnificent prose and his talent for creating an atmosphere that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end. Highly recommended."
5,"This review contains NO spoilers. Just what you should expect from the novel! 
 Okay, so being an unbiased audience to the book, I can confidently say that Tahereh Mafi absolutely nailed the book. She has a swoon-worthy plot; the whole important-leader-but-troubled-man-who-falls-for-innocent-girl-thing is kind of overused. And usually, (I say this from experience), when a writer has a great plot line he/she destroys the novel with terrible writing. 
 BUT Mafi managed to single-handedly created the illusion of a dystopian setting (that the previous book was unable to set), but ALSO establish the undefined feelings Warner had towards the Heroine. 
 And although Juliette failed to make herself seem desirable or understandable in the first book, which was one of the major drawbacks, the way Warner describes her makes her seem more intriguing and interesting, which more than makes up for that. And unlike all the other sappy-romances that exist, following a similar plot line, the story wasn't completely focused on the romance aspect. 
 Which was really fortunate, because sometimes the diary experts and Warner's thoughts just get too intense to be taken seriously. The distribution of action and romance was evenly paced, and the author managed to string together a few memorable sentences that made me want to go over them again and again until I had them by heart. 
 Of course, no novel is perfect, and I wish Julliette had done something other than observe about the cracks in the walls all day. I understand that she has been tortured and mistreated all her life, but maybe she should talk about that more, actually acknowledge the feelings she has rather than recounting numbers again and again. For me, that is just what makes her such an un-relatable protagonist. 
 Overall, I am SUPER excited for the next book. Hopefully one of the characters won't be killed off because the author can't make a decision between the two, like authors usually end love triangles. I don't care who it is (Although I am pro-Warner), as long as her reason is justified and not completely circumstantial. 
 Unravel me cannot come fast enough."
4,"I really did like this book. The world-building is awesome - this very detailed, invented history of a world with dragons in it. The level of detail to the history reminded me of Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, which is paying this book a very high compliment. 
 Owen and Siobhan are great characters. They are normal human beings, and are portrayed in a very genuine way. I also liked all the side characters - Owen's aunt Lottie and her wife; Sadie; the helpful contingent of online forum-goers. 
 Still, it's a hard ending - could be worse, but still hard - and I'm not sure if I can commit myself to the sequel, because I've heard it's devastating. I am tempted to Wikipedia it and move on with my life. (This isn't the fault of the author - it's just that I know what a book like that will do to me.)"
3,"I don't know why I continue to read these things. Maybe because I'm a sucker for love stories that end, but don't really end - you can keep going back for little snippets later. Or maybe I'm just a sucker in general. 
 But yet, here I am, reading this and smirking like an idiot. Oh well. I enjoyed it. It was nice seeing Bennett and Max again. Someday I will actually continue the series and read the third book. But I think I love their other series better. Wild Seasons, I think it is? Whatever, that one."
5,"A pledge, to drive the fear into those who will confront us. 
 I pledge myself to the Rose Society, until the end of my days. 
 To use my eyes to see all that happens. 
 My tongue to woo others to our side. 
 My ears to hear every secret. 
 My hands, to crush my enemies. 
 I will do everything in my power to destroy all who stand in my way. 
 -- Adelina, Sergio, Magiano, Violetta 
 ""Right now, all I want is the throne. Enzo's power. A perfect revenge. And all the Inquisitors, queens, and Daggers in the world won't be able to stop me."" 
 I HAVE NO IDEA HOW I FEEL. 
 Honestly. I don't. 
 I mean, holy heck was this book good. I LOVE Adelina's darkness. But at the same time, I don't. 
 I have mixed feelings. I can't go one way or the other. I can't just hate the fact that she's a sadistic, badass, evil villainous wolf! When do you ever get a character like that?! 
 But some of it is just . . . ugh. It makes my heart clench. Like, oh, Adelina, how can you BE so cruel? 
 It's just . . . it's all so sad, what happens to Adelina, the whole concept of the Elites now that Raffaele started realizing things. 
 I REALLY hate the Whispers in her mind. I want to punch them in their nonexistent faces. They leave Adelina so irrational and broken that I just can't stand it. 
 But the heartbreaking moments, scenes that gave me an adrenaline rush, the romance, all together, made this book amazing. 
 ALL HAIL MAGIANO'S HOTNESS! 
 No seriously he's amazing. I can't bear to see him have a sad look in his eyes like nO DON'T BE SAD MAGIANO!! D: 
 Enzo is great, but Magiano . . . Enzo cannot compare to him. Even I felt alive when Magiano was there. :3 
 But yeah. Marie Lu, you're AMAZING!! How you let us walk along Adelina as her mind slowly shatters, it's just . . . how do you do it?! 
 I am asking myself constantly: Do I want Adelina to live? 
 Does she deserve to live, when she's becoming a villain? When she's seemingly starting to go too far? 
 My answer: I. DON'T. FRICKING. KNOW. I hope the third book can answer my questions for me."
3,"This was gonna be 4 stars but then it really went downhill in the last 50 pages like she had no idea to end it so just threw in a bunch of crazy stuff. I loved getting Vivia's perspective, one of my new faves. Merik was annoying and his treatment of Cam and refusal to acknowledge his pronouns was infuriating. Safi was fine but her plot was kinda boring and went nowhere, although I was into her blossoming friendship with Vaness and hope that goes further in the future books. Loved Iseult, she's my bae, and learning more about her magic. The tension between her and Aeduan was cool but now I guess he isn't evil so that's kinda lame. It was fast-paced and fun but the multi perspectives was a bit of whiplash esp. when it went back to a boring plot or a person I didn't care that much about (cough cough Merik). Even if the plot went downhill, I do think Susan Dennard is an accomplished writer and her books feel like they've been professionally edited unlike some YA fantasy books, so I look forward to reading the next one."
4,Nice end to the series.
5,What a beautiful love story. I loved the hero and heroine and their love story was amazing.
4,Rating: 3.5 out of 5
1,"I really wanted to like this book. The premise sounded intriguing and I thought it would be a wonderfully psychological read. Man stranded on Mars? How could that not be gripping and thrilling to read about? 
 Sadly, it was boring. It was one of those stories I think would have been amazing if it had been written by someone else. That's not to say that others would not enjoy it or were wrong for enjoying it. I just prefer my sci-fi to be more about the story and the characters rather than about solving problems with science and engineering. If you like reading about tech/engineering, than you might really like this book. 
 It started going downhill rather quickly. I felt like I was reading the journal of a frat boy stuck in space. It is hard for me to take a character serious when he names a unit of measurement a pirate ninja, or when he is cracking childish and unoriginal jokes. I can see what the author was trying to do with this character. I suppose he is supposed to come off as a real person, flaws and bad jokes and all. But he was written too one dimensional and it failed. In all actuality, it was not just the character that was one dimensional. It was the whole story. The whole premise is that Watney is left behind. Something breaks. He thinks about it for a bit. He then fixes it. Then something breaks. After some more thought he fixes it. Then something breaks and he fixes it. (view spoiler)[I never once thought that the character wasn't going to make it. There was no drama, no thrilling will he or won't he survive moments. It was pretty clear from the beginning that Watney and NASA would fix it so he could get off of Mars. (hide spoiler)] 
 Maybe the movie will be better. I certainly hope so. At the very least some really cool special effects couldn't hurt the story anymore than the gay probe joke does."
2,"I didn't dislike this book, but I kind of had to force myself to finish it. It was not what I was expecting, and I never really felt for any of the characters. This book isn't what I look for from le Guin."
1,"It's hard to even start with the ways that this book is a disaster-- from the map that appears to be a map in which all planets in single heliocentric solar system (and nothing in the book ever contradicts the idea that they all orbit a single sun except that the characters refer to ""the galaxy"" ""the universe"" and ""the world"" [while in space] interchangeably)... divided into ""quadrants"". This is as sensical as the ""worldbuilding"" ever gets. To the fact that the protagonist has been raised as the only surviving heir to the Galactic Empire-- without ever, apparently, ever learning what her own regent's positions are on the biggest political issue of the day. That the alternating viewpoint characters never meet and their stories barely intersect. That a major new character is introduced in the last quarter of the book. Or how about the fact that the protagonist's father, when emperor, bombed an inhabited planet into smithereens, but we're supposed to consider him heroic and noble because after that, he graciously concluded a peace?"
4,"7.5/10 
 I loved Matched. I was disappointed by Crossed. My feelings on Reached fall right in between the two...I really enjoyed parts, was disappointed by parts, but all in all it was a good finish to the series. There were flashes of the brilliance that had me captivated in Matched...and the writing was better than in Crossed...but, like Crossed, the book gets bogged down in details that don't really move the story forward, and at times seemed to add confusion just for the sake of ""mystery""...which was just annoying. Still the emotions wrapped up in the end had a big lump in my throat, and I loved the hopeful tone it ended with. 
 Not perfect, but very good."
4,"Outcast wizard with ability to look at future (like Nicolas Cage in Next) is suddenly in high demand. Sadistic baddies and officious, bureaucratic baddies and other baddies want him to help them access a booby trapped powerful relic. Meanwhile, the vulnerable girl he's been training is targeted by some of the same baddies because she stumbled upon a key. 
 An entertaining, pacey romp. Good second tier contemporary fantasy. (It's less flawed than Mike Shevdon's Faerie-in-contemporary-Britain materials, but not as amazing as Ben Aaranovitch's genuinely urban fantasy / myths / police procedural / humour crossover series)"
1,"DNF @ 5% 
 Yeah I'm giving up. I've been ""reading"" this for over a month now and I'm only 51 pages in. I'm going to give myself the breathing room to get to other books (I don't like reading more than two books at once) that I actually want to read. I'll get back to this at some point. Maybe..."
4,"** spoiler alert ** 
 I just got done reading this book for probably the third time this month. 
 ** tiny spoiler alert** 
 I originally scored this a one star, because frankly, I couldn't take one more minute of Bella. ""Whine, whine, and more whine. It's all my fault, I'm such a bad, unworthy human."" That's my biggest qualm about the character. Good God, enough! 
 But, now that I've read all of them, I can see where SM had to set up the whole ""I know I need to let you go, but I'm too selfish to do that, so you're still going to love me Jacob, and you must be a part of my life"" thing so that Jacob can imprint later. 
 But in all honesty, EVERYONE just wants more of Edward, and less of Bella's internal pity party."
2,"This book is supposed to be in the regency style, and I suppose it was, but something was lacking. The characters did not seem to get quite enough development, I guess. This book was a little boring until the middle, where the pace picked up considerably. The end is action-packed and quite interesting! (Maybe too action-packed for a regency novel? I haven't read very many) The glamour was awesome though! This book was pretty good, but I don't think I would reread it."
1,"Armstrong's books are hit or miss for me, and this was a miss. The constant viewpoint switches, coupled with a main character that I couldn't care less about, meant that I really had no interest in this story. 
 Will I still read Armstrong? Yes. Her good books are quite good--but this one just didn't work for me."
4,"This review will have a different format than any of my others thus far, but it's a book that deserves it. The book has a distinguished individuality that makes it deserve special attention. 
 Layout-Amazing. Blue ink to match cover makes it seem seamless. The two interchanging POV's that have their own unique voice that shows incredible talent from the writer. The temps posted at the beginning of each chapter help to show both if there was a break in scenes and foreshadows events within the book. 
 Characters-Sam is easy for me to associate myself with. He is a character with true depth that his life has developed. Grace is mature for her age due to negligence from her parents. The only character that was a 'typical' teenager was Rachel, but she was still likable. A problem I often have trouble with in reading YA as they often have problems that seem insignificant. 
 Plot-This is the only aspect I had a problem with. It was slow and had repetitive parts. If you have read my other reviews you'll notice they are often character focused, which is my priority in any format of story whether it be book, movie or game. Character. So the plot problems where insignificant in retrospective.

 Wow, this was SO impressive. I've been trying to find a realistic YA contemporary about teens who care for their autistic siblings and this was so perfect. I'd recommend it if you like Sarah Dessen or Kasie West! 
 Chloe is seventeen, popular, dating the most attractive guy in school, and looks like she has an easy life. Her older sister Ivy is autistic, so Chloe has spent most of her life protecting and caring for her (their mother is a little self-absorbed and easily overwhelmed). Their home life has realistic complications, too, like a challenging stepfather and the pain of their father's death. 
 When Chloe sets out on a mission to get Ivy a boyfriend, she happens to pick the younger brother of David, a rude guy in Chloe's English class. Chloe and David have to accompany their siblings on all of their dates, so they start to bond and see a different side of each other. 
 David has no social life and has never dated before because he's his brother's caretaker. He's a really refreshing male character because he CRIES, expresses his feelings, and is a feminist. Chloe's actually an awesome main character, too, with her confidence and sarcasm. Claire LaZebnik does an amazing job writing authentic teens! I totally adored these two and their whole hate-to-love relationship. 
 But what really made this book so amazing was how realistic the characters were while they dealt with everything. Chloe's thoughts & responses were honest -- she's a flawed human who will become irritated with her sister at times. I thought the way she interacted with her sister was wonderful, though. She was super inspirational because I'm definitely not always that patient with the people in my life who are on the spectrum. 
 Chloe's popular boyfriend makes the typical unaware remarks like calling her sister ""messed up"" or referring to ""people like her."" Her friends don't really understand and provide the type of comments and situations that so desperately need to be called out... but it's all done really well. Like everyone honestly means well in this story, but sometimes they act from places of ignorance/fear or don't understand the whole picture: 
 An elderly couple is walking by, and the man maneuvers around his wife so he can put himself between her and our group. He's being gallant. 
 It hurts, especially because he's probably just some sweet old guy who loves his wife and wants to protect her from bad things. 
 But Ivy and Ethan aren't bad things. 
 I'm so grateful that the story was still funny, endearing, and hopeful because so many books about realistic challenges become unnecessarily depressing or try to sugarcoat it. These characters seemed like real people and the whole thing just felt honest. Chloe asks David ""don't you feel like we're living in a different world from everyone else at school?"" And that is exactly what I've felt like with most of the YA contemporaries where the biggest issues are boys, drama with friends, or getting into college. I feel like I'm living in a different world from those books. 
 This book is SO relatable, important, heartwarming, and aaaah I don't want to spoil the main story so I can't properly gush. But there were seriously so many powerful scenes! You can feel the characters growing as they try to maintain the best possible world for the people they care about, even though they're not always right about what that might be. 
 Oh, and I do want to find a way to highlight that one of the main characters is gay without spoiling anything, so... I'll just leave this here? 
 Thank you to the publisher for sending me an ARC!"
5,"Shadow and Bone is simply fantastic. I feel like a won the book lottery the other day. I read two fabulous books back to back! Now that's something that doesn't happen every day. 
 Okay, back to Shadow and Bone. The story is all about what happens when you let your deepest secrets free, and choose to be yourself. I loved that. It was also fast, there was a lot of action, and there were some interesting secrets:) Read it for yourself to see how fabulous it is."
4,"I have not read The Widow. Based on the cover of The Child, I expected a mystery thriller with some sort of dastardly killer going around and snatching a baby. 
 Instead, I got a novel that was focused far more on the developing characters and their relationships to one another. Of course we know that eventually it'll lead us to finding out how the child bones got to where they were, but it didn't read at all like a hunt-for-the-killer type of novel. I expected something more along the lines of Pop Goes the Weasel with a race against the clock. 
 That isn't to say it's badly written; I merely wanted to express my expectations. I still managed to finish this far too quickly because I was dying to see how all the different players fit together. I was able to figure out most of it, but that sweet, sweet moment of confirmation is always what I crave at the end of these things. 
 It's a good book, though I can't attest to its likability compared to The Widow. Probably people will like it."
4,"Jess Walter continues to impress. After reading Citizen Vince, Beautiful Ruins, and now this, I've come to realize that he certainly doesn't write the same book twice! Financial Lives is so resonant about events that have taken place in the last few years (the financial crisis) it's sometimes a bit painful to read. Walter sustains a bittersweet comic tone throughout and he really sticks the ending. His denouement is realistic, hopeful, and touching, all at the same time."
5,"Cute contemporary. Nothing special, but I love how the books tie together. But it goes to show that the superlatives actually change people!"
5,"IS IT THE END?????? 
 It's simple......... I.LOVED.EVERY.SINGLE.MINUTE.OF.THIS.BOOK!!!!! 
 It's a 
 MUST 
 read if you've read the Dark Duet. I would be a shame to come this far and not finish the dark and intense journey. 
 It may be dark and twisted, but Caleb and Livvie's love is REAL and GENUINE. It may not seem like it, but in the end the saved each other. Their story is hard to read, but Caleb's epilogue makes it so much more worth it. 
 There's not much to say aside from this is trademark BRILLANCE from Ms. Roberts. It's just as emotional, chilling, captivating, aaaaaand for the best part..... told by Caleb. Yay! Male POV! Yes, he's still cocky, twisted, and oh so alluring; but, he's also changed since he left Livvie at the border. You'll be surprised at what time can do..... 
 Should I feel guilty that I was laughing out loud at certain parts??? Maybe...... maybe not. But in my defense, it IS written from the male POV which can be very simplistic and black and white at times. Caleb is quite funny under that brooding-I'm-gonna-kick-your-ass exterior. It was quite entertaining. 
 Of course I think there's more to the story beyond what is laid out in Epilogue. You're naive to think Livvie and Caleb are lucky enough to have a HEA in the true sense. I'm not even sure I'd like the story if they did - that's just not who they are. Would it be nice if Ms. Roberts bought us more Caleb and Livvie the future? Abso-freaking-lutely! But, I'm fine drawing my own conclusions........ for now. 
 ""There is no real ending. It's just a place where you stop the story."""
5,"My thoughts are all over the map on this book. I love it and i dislike parts of the book. I don't want to wait for the next book to come out but I know have too. This book was greatly well written and developed in a lot of ways. I felt my heart seeping out of my body at the end of the book. To me, it a sad ending but a necessary one within the series. 
 I can't wait to read the last and final book but i don't want it to end at all."
4,"Cute story, well-written"
4,"4.5/5 stars 
 After reading: 
 I'm sorry you if didn't like this, but this is the Fever series and I loved it. This is Mac and Jericho Barrons and Ryo and Dani (and WTF was that twist?) and Lor and even Jo. What's not to like about it? 
 Like usual, I don't have words to describe how obsessed I am with this characters. I want to know more. Gimme more. More of the Nine. More of Mac and the book. More of Jericho Barrons (always more, never enough of him). 
 I'm going with Barrons here: Actions speak louder than words. And so do gifs. 
 --- 
 Reading: 
 So that's how you choose to start this book? With that scene from Barrons' POV? That f** scene? You're a woman after my heart, Karen. You are! Here, I'll give it to you so you can pass it along to Jericho F* Barrons!! My ovaries exploded! That's all I'm saying! 
 -- 
 Before reading: 
 I honestly don't know if I should. I mean, it took me FOREVER to get over my book hangover after reading the first five books in (what?) a week? It doesn't sound healthy to get back to this series, does it? I'll fall for Jericho all over again and my life won't be the same after I'm done reading it, and and and... I shouldn't, but I probably will."

 Original review published on: In the Closet With a Bibliophile 
 Buried in secrecy and fear, DARK EDEN by Patrick Carman is eerie and suspenseful, every scene built and dedicated to the emotions surrounding Fort Eden. As readers we can feel the fears that seep through each individual character, throwing up red, flashing warning signs in our peripherals that we do our best to ignore and so we can carry on through the murky depths of the base, looking for a cure to what haunts these petrified teens. 
 Fort Eden 
 The place sent a chill of dread down my spine from the moment I saw it. Low slung to the ground, made entirely of concrete slabs crawling with moss and vines. My first impression was of a massive casket left alone in the woods for years and years, overrun by a menacing forest of gloom. 
 My feelings concerning DARK EDEN are a little twisted in and of themselves. I agree with many of the reviews I've read --parts of them anyway--in that the book was pretty good. The characters, while not fully people I grew to love, I enjoyed them from a detached point of view. I wasn't sure how Mr. Carman was going to develop his characters because for most of the book, our narrator, Will Besting, isn't in the compound with them at all. The clever use of the televisions in the underground bunker proved to be even more of a development then I could have asked for. It's quite amazing at what you can learn from a person when they think no one is watching them. Still, I never felt any real connection to the characters, including Will, until after their ""cure"". This worked for the book, I think because seeing those fears was like an instant way I could relate to that person. Not that I have experienced anything they had, but it made them more human and gave them ""more"" as a character. 
 The compound, Fort Eden, became its own character. With the many doors and the paint and the whispering voices it was the secret that we are surrounded by but don't have a clue what it means. It's frightening and the heightened sense of awareness we suddenly get whenever Will ventures into Fort Eden cannot be denied. Really...it's freakishly creepy. 
 I held one of the rails and started walking, but stopped short at the sound of a distant whispering voice radiating from the deep. It sounded like someone was searching down the long hallways of my mind, trying to find me but failing. 
 All of these factors made me really enjoy the book, but it was the ending that frustrated me. A ton of people loved the ending for its serious whiplash effect. I mean, we're reading along and all of the sudden, that ending hits us out of nowhere and BAM!! we are suddenly looking back trying to figure out if we missed something. Was there a sign of what was happening, a sign of what everything really was? Normally, I love a good surprise in a book and this was a whopper of a surprise. But, I it still frustrated me. I keep trying to pin down why, but I guess it's because I was expecting the book to be a contemporary, teen horror of sorts and that ending was a genre changer. But, after a couple conversations with Jenny I think it's mostly that the main characters in the book got a raw deal and I'm angry at a character I think deserves to die. I don't want to give anything away because the surprise is kind of fun, in a way, and I don't like spoiling anything. 
 So, for all those who've read it, here's my spoiler portion (view spoiler)[I'm upset that Will has to wait 60 years to kill Rainsford/Davis. I mean, what if he doesn't live that long? I know why he is waiting, but I guess I have anger issues. I want vengeance, NOW! o_o (hide spoiler)] 
 Overall, I really liked the story. The writing was good and perfectly creepy. The characters were well done and the fears were excellently played. My only complaint is parts of the ending, but that is only a personal preference. I think that so many people will love what Mr. Carman has done. He's taken something that could have been similar and mundane and given it a very unexpected twist. Funny thing is going back and rereading it, knowing how the ending is, I like it a lot better than the first time. So, I give DARK EDEN a 3.5/5 and recommend it to those who enjoy YA Fiction with a little bit of creepy mixed in."
4,"I truly like this book. Payne is one of my favorite females. 
 I like Vishous - Jane - Butch more in this book. 
 But I missed John M. a lot he had been in all the books since book 2 and I needed more Qhuay time. 
 My heart is broken for Qhuinn, but he deserved a little pain (sorry he hurt too much Blay). 
 And I got misty eyes in the last scene Blay - Saxton. Saxton is a good male. 
 I'm team John Matthew....I'm team Qhuay...I love the boys!!!!"
5,"Many thanks to the author & publisher for providing The Bandwagon with an ARC. 
 Anyone who knows me, knows that before I received a full BSc in Criminology & Criminal Justice Studies from Plymouth University, I studied Policing at a small college in Cornwall. It was very much like when Sergeant Angle - sorry, Angel - arrived in the arse-end of nowhere in Hot Fuzz. A girl from London, with a huge amount of distrust for the police, found herself studying the enemy in a place where the civilians all know their local bobby, and wet themselves at the idea of policing in the big city (i.e., Plymouth, with 3 F's). 
 Anyway. My point is, I love this series. It a) tests my knowledge of PACE, my old nemesis, b) reminds me of my glory days with my policing buddies, pretty much none of whom have actually gone on to be police officers, and c) has enough fast-paced car chases and magically-charged fights to get the blood pumping. 
 For those of you who don't know, Peter Grant is a police officer for a special branch of the Met, Falcon. Special meaning magical. Peter and his boss Nightingale are wizards, or practitioners, of the magical arts, and it's a good thing too, since there seems to be a high level of magical criminals, including enraged river goddesses, unicorns, and, of course, the Faceless Man. 
 In case you haven't already started this series, The Hanging Tree is the sixth installment, and provides just as much action, hilarity and enjoyment as the rest of the series. The books released so far are: 
 Rivers of London 
 Moon Over Soho 
 Whispers Underground 
 Broken Homes 
 Foxglove Summer 
 The Hanging Tree 
 The Hanging Tree sees Peter back in London, caught up in another fight between magical beings, still attempting to apprehend the Faceless Man and his old partner and friend, Lesley. Will our dashing copper about town make it out of this one? 
 Readers are anxious to get their hands on this book, having been waiting for about two years since we devoured Foxglove Summer, and it definitely promises to excite. Fear not; The Hanging Tree is out on Nov 3rd, and you can get your hands on your very own copy.

5,"Confession: I never had any interest in the Oz stories. Not as a child, when I felt pressured to read them...and not as an adult, when I never gave it another thought. 
 That is, until my sister couldn't stop raving about the musical and was so obsessed she scoured her local bookstores for the book. 
 When she first approached me about it, I felt obligated to smile and nod, because aside from Twilight, this was the only other story that she's ever spoken to me about. I really couldn't be bothered. 
 Confession #2: I was upset when she forced me to borrow her copy so I, too, could be amazed. 
 You can't imagine how happy I was when I fell into a reading rut. I overdosed on horror books and needed something to break the monotony. 
 Enter, Wicked. 
 Let me say that I expected to be bored. I expected to be annoyed. I expected to hate it. None of these things came to be. From the first page, I fell into a trance. I couldn't imagine what I thought would be a cheesey childrens' book would actually be more of a grown up's fairy tale with characters a lot more multi-dimensional than I could ever hope for. 
 I loved Elphaba. Green, harsh, cold little Elphaba. She, who wasn't evil at all. She, who endured being virtually invisible to her parents, neglected, yet a spectacle to everyone else. 
 Her family's background was also fascinating. 
 (view spoiler)[ From her lonely, self-centered, cheating mother...to her pious, yet self-indulgent father that couldn't stand to look at her without feeling as if she was his punishment. 
 Elphaba's supposed ""deformities"" actually had nothing to do with her father, though. They had to do with a potion her mother drank before fornicating with some whimsical stranger. 
 The true wicked witch, Elphaba's younger sister, also had a deformity, but this was due to pills their mother took during pregnancy to keep the child from suffering the same fate as Elphaba. (The meds come from Elphaba's grandmother) 
 The younger sister is also not biologically their ""father's,"" but it's eluded that he knew but didn't care...and at the same time, he seemed to love the child he knew wasn't his more than the child he assumed was his. 
 (hide spoiler)] 
 This is just some of the drama in the book. 
 There is so much more to it than that. This book focuses on how she was destined to play a role that she physically fit, but internally, she wasn't. (She did have her bad moments, but who doesn't?) The book is written in such a beautiful way...almost poetic, but not to the point where it'd lose the reader or distract. 
 If you have a taste for drama, love/hate relationships, infidelity, sibling rivalry, and a wee bit of sex, this is the book for you. 
 There's also a big surprise at the end. I'd love to spoil it for you, but I can't bring myself to do it. 
 I just want to thank my sister for not allowing my disinterest to sway her. If she hadn't been pushy about me reading Wicked, I would have lost out on one hell of a story. I also thank the author for making me a fan of an Oz character."
3,It's a pamphlet of common sense.
4,"I loved the quirky and tongue in cheek shenanigans of the bluestocking heroine Alexia Tarabotti, the soulless preternatural of the title and a cast of interesting and campy supernaturals. Set in a steampunk Victorian England (is that tautology, I'm not sure that steampunk can be set in any other time) vampires and werewolves have been disappearing and it is up to Alexia and her trusty parasol with the help of the very virile ( and somewhat ""annoying"") werewolf alpha Lord Conall Maccon to get to the bottom of the mystery. With some clever observations of the Victorian age, witty banter between hero and heroine and a well paced plot, I really enjoyed this first book of the Parasol Protectorate series."

 First Season 
 The Flesh Cartel #1: Capture 
 The Flesh Cartel #2: Auction 
 Second Season begins with this book #3. 
 Per Riptide Publishing: 
 Reader discretion advised. This title contains the following sensitive themes: 
 explicit violence 
 non-consent 
 Fair warning, this is NOT MM Romance. This is a psycho-sexual thriller which includes rape and torture. Please proceed with that knowledge. 
 One of my updates described this as a ""speeding bullet"" and holy hell it is. Each episode has just, flat out, been one hell of a ride. This speeding bullet will hit you hard with pain, torture, mind fucks and god, this underlying gut-twisting need for these guys to hang on. It's like you know you you'd already be totally gone, but Dougie and Mat just can't lose it...not yet. Then, at the same time, losing it would be the best kindness they could get. 
 You WILL feel these books, these characters, this crazy intensity that doesn't slow down for one minute. 
 THE CHARACTERS 
 ___ 
 They killed me and I'm a ghost and this is limbo, and they sent me here for hurting my own brother. 
 Dougie - A PhD grad student isolated with only his devastating guilt for company, he is being prepared to meet a psychological master. 
 ___ 
 ...and it didn't escape him how fucked-up his worldview had become when the thought of being claimed by his new owner was something to look the fuck forward to. 
 Mat - The Fighter. His endurance is his worst enemy; then he meets Nickolai, who plans to teach Mat to endure...everything. 
 ___ 
 Nikolai preferred transformation and ascension to brute terms like ""breaking,"" 
 Nickolai A fucking, twisted fuck. Who's character is this? Rachel, Heidi? Damn, I know I hate this guy, without question...but.... 
 ___ 
 THE STORY 
 Out of the fire, into the frying pan. Yeah, that about sums this one up. 
 THE WRITING 
 Again, if a story with this level of intensity wasn't written perfectly, it would be a glaring problem. In my opinion, this is written perfectly. In fact, beyond perfect. The hidden, twisted mental turns just kept screwing me to my chair. I want/need to look away but I can't begin to put this series down. Bring me more. 
 The title, Choices, seemed innocent enough, heh. The next is Consequences Holy hell! 
 A very sincere thank you to Netgalley and Riptide Publishing for providing me with a early release version of this book, in exchange for an honest review.

3,"Very readable book No 11 of a series I've really enjoyed. Hunky vampires, solid world building and one of the best sidekicks in PNR, Levett the slightly imperfect gargoyle. 
 This series is hopefully moving towards its natural conclusion, although there is at least one more couple set up (Fallon and Cyn) as Roke the Nevada Vampire Leader and Sally Grace, witch come Fairy Princess find out if their accidental ""mating"" is a spell gone wrong or the real deal. (view spoiler)[ Yep, its the latter! (hide spoiler)] 
 (3.5 stars)"
4,"Alexi Littrell is keeping a secret. Something happened to her over the summer, something that drives her to hide in her closet and scratch the back of her neck to the point of bleeding. She's lost but she can't show it. That all changes when a tragedy rocks their town and Bodee Lennox, known as The Kool-Aid Kid due to him dying his hair wild colors with packs of Kool-Aid, is suddenly living with them. He gets Alexi in ways no one else does and together, they just might be able to start facing their pasts and start healing. 
 This is definitely the kind of book that stays with you. Alexi's voice, her confused thoughts, everything about her, just came off as so real that there were times while reading that my hands were shaking. This is a voice that could easily belong to someone you know. 
 There's a lot of books out there that deal with rape but this is the first one I've come across that deals with the victim making excuses for her rapist. The 'I let him', the 'he was hurt/vulnerable', the 'other than that night, he's a good guy'. With all this, Alexi's mind and thoughts are an understandable mess. I felt for her through the whole book. 
 Bodee, I definitely fell in love with him. He was so caring and gentle with Alexi, even while facing his own demons. The slow development of their friendship was absolutely amazing. Alexi's two girlfriends, Heather and Liz, were also great characters. Very different from each other so each had their own voice and their own issues through the book. 
 One of the favorite things was how Alexi latched on to Captain Lyric, a person who had written a song lyric on her desk and when she wrote the next line, it became their thing. I completely understood her desire not to find out who was Captain Lyric because knowing would change everything. 
 I did suspect who the rapist was early on but that didn't matter. It's not a story full of twists, it's about Alexi trying to come to terms with what happened to her. The writing, the pacing, the sensitivity to such hard topics, it's really hard to believe this is a debut author. Courtney C Stevens is definitely someone to watch for. 
 *I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."
2,"This book was a bit of a disappointment for me. There are so many rave reviews of it that I expected some profound piece of horror. I didn't even shelve it as horror, because it did nothing to unnerve me, save for one line. 
 (view spoiler)[When Julian said that Merricat was dead, I got a shiver. But then the author backs away from that choice. (hide spoiler)] Other than that, the story was bland and predictable. There was nothing that really kept me engaged, other than the fact that this is a short book."
4,"Man I am sad this series is over. I want more Kaiden and Anna! So Sweet Reckoning is the third and final book in the Sweet Evil Trilogy (though there will be a book from Kai's POV covering all three books so I cannot wait for that to come out!!!). It starts off with everyone having to be really careful to not be noticed doing anything wrong. The Duke's are suspicious of Anna and her friends so they have been watching them closely. They finally have started to let up since for the past months they haven't stepped out of line, but the Duke's are worried that Anna is the one from the prophecy. Obviously they don't want that prophecy to come true as it would be bad news for them so things are a bit tricky. 
 One of my favorite parts came pretty quick, quicker than I thought it would. I will say that I literally did a happy dance around the room when I got to the part where they figure out how to fool Kai's dad into thinking Anna is not the one that the prophecy is about. I mean it is what I thought they should do anyways, but when it happened so early in the book I was just like YES! I love them! So so good. 
 So they are able to fool the Duke's for a bit, and try to assemble as many allies as they can, but things come to a head at the end. I will say right after I finished the big showdown I was like yes!! Way to go! Oh no, that means this will be over soon...but then I thought about the big showdown and it was a little not as epic as it could have been. There were some parts, like the sword's roll, which were not really that key of a part. I mean the sword is talked about a lot so I did expect it to play a main roll in the showdown at the end, but it didn't really. Still I did enjoy the book. I was sad when it ended and now I will just have to wait to read Kai's version of events. I cannot wait!!

3,"This was my second time trying out Jaci Burton, and while it was significantly better then the first it still wasn't great. Burton is excellent at writing male hero's but her heroine's leave something to be desired. These supposedly independent and successful heroines are doormats, even when their decisions make sense. While I wish Burton's fans the best, I'm definitely not one of them."

3,"Beautifully written, but really weird. 
 Review in Swedish at Boktycke."
2,"You know who would like this book? Lit majors who went to a fancy private university in Paris. ;) Lookn' right at'cha, Caite Dolan-Leach. (I'm just guessing she's a lit major, the way this book reads.) I guess I can't be overly critical, because she did do a good job painting her picture. But the writing style is so off-putting, and the story so uninteresting that I can't muster more than two stars for this novel. 
 Generally, I really enjoy word play and having fun with language. I was hoping for a more clever use of this based on the promise of the book's title, blurb on the back, and general set-up in the beginning of the book. There's a lot of alliteration, a kinda half-baked promise of a word game that seems conveniently placed throughout the whole ""mystery"" aspect... I don't know. It just didn't come together for me. I didn't find the word play interesting enough. It didn't tie in seamlessly with the suspense portion of the novel. It was a gimmick. Something that author clearly found interesting and did her best to build a story around. The author spent a whole ton of time on thesaurus.com, but that doesn't make for clever wordplay. It makes for writing that reads unnaturally, as you trip over uncommon terms and phrases every other sentence for no reason whatsoever. 
 Speaking of tripping over stuff, I found many Dolan-Leache's references unclear and ill-placed in a novel that's supposed to be a suspense. Again, the story read like it was written for a specific audience. Am I the only one who didn't know what Oulipo is? Is ""constrained writing"" a common term among casual readers who didn't specifically study literature and literary devices? Maybe I'm just a moron, but I had to stop and take some time to look both of these up. And then, after presenting all this, the flippin' author didn't even follow any interesting constraints in her own writing! I mean, yeah, there's the stupid word game that was baaaarely interesting nor did it have any meaningful place in this story other than to give the illusion of clever writing. There was so much missed opportunity for creating all sorts of word games throughout the novel. Maybe I missed them? IDK. I went back and read through all the letters and noticed just the alliteration. The important chapters followed an alphabetical order. What else was there? I wish there were more fun linguistic puzzles for the reader to solve. Maybe they're there and if I missed them please someone point them out to me. 
 Other than the annoying writing style, there wasn't much else I really noticed about this book. The characters are all horrible people. Including the protagonist. They lead miserable lives and have shallow, unhappy relationships with each other. They never grow, they never develop, they're all petulant, immature, uninteresting people. I have no idea why Wyatt loves Ava, because she's awful. But he does. It's just stated like, ""Yep, he's always been in love with her. Whatever. Accept it. This is the love story of the book, so you gotta believe this feelings part of it."" There's no complexity to the characters or any of their interpersonal relationships. I don't really get the driving force behind why a common reader would enjoy this book. But it's got a lot of good reviews so far. It's pretty new though, so it may all be downhill from here. I suggest you skip this one."
4,Awesome! I could totally see this being made into a movie.
3,"I am still a little conflicted about my overall feelings. The reason this book receives 3 stars, is because though the plot is very...(makes you really want to read), sometimes the narration drones on a little too much (the letters from Nettie to Celie ESPECIALLY drag), and...I just felt like the characters were really impulsive. 
 This is the first time I've read a book, in which the characters are changing hearts and dropping lovers like a person goes grocery shopping. It felt really awkward for me, since this is the first time I've read a book like that. 
 I guess another reason I'm unnerved by the book is the relationship between Shugs Avery and Celie. I just...(no words can explain)... 
 When I read a book, I like to be able to know what the characters' sexual orientation is, so that I can write off some actions as normal or suspicious. I like a little mystery in my books, a little deception, but The Color Purple just dominates the Mystery of Human Feelings. WAIT! Let me rephrase that...The Color Purple is simple to understand, yet also strange; I am just completely baffled about the sexual orientation of Celie (I think I've figured out Shugs Avery's, but not Celie's), why Celie let Alphonso do what he did, and why the characters in the book seem SO VERY IMPULSIVE. 
 On another note, I find it intriguing that when Celie finds the letters from Nettie, Nettie was very engrossed in letting her sister know about what it was like in Africa, living with the Olinka. I liked that part of the letters, because it was especially realistic. 
 However, after Celie stopped writing ""Dear God,..."" and switched to ""Dear Nettie,..."", I found it really hard to follow the story because I couldn't really tell if this was another diary entry, or another letter (the only distinction between the two was the ""Dear Nettie/God"" and ""Dear Celie"". 
 (view spoiler)[Nettie x Samuel seemed a little...wrong to me. After Nettie and Samuel spent a lot of time trying to convince Corinne that they met each other the first time the two parties met each other, they still end up together anyway?! I felt like they were betraying Corinne's memory by doing that. I'm glad that they are happy, but I still felt a little betrayed. 
 AND THE TIME LENGTH!!! OMG, time passed so fast, I had no idea that by the end of the book, Celie and Nettie were eventually old women! I was SO dang surprised! (hide spoiler)]"
4,"This is based on the fairy tale of the 12 Dancing Princesses, which has always been one of my favorites. I liked this retelling better than any of the others I've read. I'm still waiting for the perfect version though - I'll probably have to write it myself! :)"
4,"[review written 2013] 
 so yeah i just finished code name verity and i liked it a lot. i've heard a lot of good things about this book, but i didn't find it as good as everyone else said it would. for me, the book picked up about two thirds of the way through. (it's hard to not spoil anything because there is a lot to spoil and a giant painful plot twist that comes near the end that i still cannot believe.) 
 both maddie and queenie sounded the same, i think, there wasn't much of a different voice to them. i also felt that their friendship went from acquaintance to soulmates with no in-between. that was jarring for me. 
 it also felt very technical to me. that might be because i don't know much about world war 2 air pilots, but i loved that women handle everything in it, i love that it's a story that features mainly two young women. i loved that. 
 the diary narration felt like a diary some of the time but other times there was dialog, and trust me, i've tried to write diaries like a story-real ones-and it doesn't work, you don't remember what it said and real life speech can't translate to page too well. but it felt more diary-like than many other stories i've read with character's writing in diary form, with underlined and crossed out words, with no punctuation sometimes 
 so that was a good. it was a book that was hard to get into, but once you did, it was a lot more interesting. or maybe i'm just tired."
4,"Solid 4 stars! 
 Expectation: a fluffy contemporary 
 Reality: me crying by the last page"
4,"I read and loved the Fionavar books when they came out. Part of that was a matter of timing - I read them just as I was really becoming a dedicated fantasy reader and I would have been in my mid to late teens at the time. These were the first ""out of our world"" type books I'd read that had adult protagonists - before that I'd been reading books about teenagers having adventures - and to meet these university students (or they may even had been graduates, I don't 100% remember now) was like entering a new world. I loved it. And as good (but depressing) as I found Tigana, I missed that element in Kay's second work. Historical fiction/fantasy isn't as much my thing and I think that's a significant factor in my I didn't read Kay's other books. 
 In Ysabel it seemed that I might get the best of both worlds - that unreality in our reality theme I like combined with Kay's more matured writing talents. 
 For the first half of the book, I wasn't exactly sure. The book moved well, the characters were excellently drawn and I was very interested - but I admit I wasn't captivated. I wondered if I had been expecting too much; if the combination of probably inaccurate memories of books I'd really liked joined with Kay's current reputation built on the books I hadn't read had made me demand far too much from one book. Then, about half way through, some new, but familiar characters turned up, their presence made some of the previously mysterious illusions make sense and the book really took off. And in the end, I loved it. It loses out on a perfect score because of that marginally weaker first half, but I recommend Ysabel whole-heartedly. And for all that I said the presence of those other characters (I didn't guess who they were going to be, so don't want to spoil it for anyone else who might otherwise be surprised) marked the turn in the book, I still believe the book would be just as satisfying for anyone who hasn't read Kay before. Their arrival in the turning point, but I doesn't matter if the reader has met them previously or not. 
 So, the book itself. 
 Nick, the protagonist, seems to me to be very well drawn. I admit I don't have any personal experience with 15 year old boys in 2007, but he felt real to me. He runs, listens to his ipod (verisimilitude or pop culture reference that will date?), emails his friends back at school and embarks on a tentative friendship with an American girl his own age on an exchange in Provence. But all is not as simple as it seems and an encounter with a strange man in a cathedral sets Nick and Kate on a strange journey, caught up in a centuries old love triangle. He's forced to discover, first that he isn't as grown up as he imagined and then to do that growing up as he must deal with adult issues and new mental abilities waking inside him. 
 The minor characters are also well drawn, especially Melanie with her green hair, organised mind and post-it notes. Of all the people filling the book, it is probably Kate who is the most broadly drawn, an odd situation considering that she, along with Nick, is part of the story from the beginning. Yet somehow, she never truly became part of the central, or at least it seemed that way to me. I'm still not sure if this was intentional or accidental. 
 The first half of the book is full of mysteries and unanswered questions; something I found a little frustrating and that reduced my enjoyment of that part of the book. There were so many hints of what was going on without telling me anything and that drives me nuts! However, my faith and persistence was rewarded, because once the answers started coming, around the halfway point, all the pieces that had been so carefully set up began to fall into place and everything began to pick up pace beautifully. 
 This is a tale about how history impinges on the present, not only the ancient history that is the central plot of the book, but family history as well. As the book progresses we discover that Nick's mother, a doctor working in the Sudan with Doctors Without Borders is running from her own past issues, focussing on her estrangement with her sister that has lasted the better part of twenty years. This is addressed and developed as Nick's aunt arrives to help with the mystical aspects of the tale and while a healing is begun, I was pleased that the two women still had work to do and it wasn't possible to dismiss two decades of acrimony overnight, no matter what the pressing world issues they might be facing. 
 All in all, I really enjoyed this book. While it is absolutely a stand alone novel, it would also be possible to see Nick and Company return in a future novel and I would be delighted to do so. A lovely book, it has also inspired me to put A Song for Arbonne on my TBR pile and The Summer Tree on my to-be-reread pile.

5,Can we just...stop...and appreciate this book. I love it so much. So darn much. Review to come.
4,"4.5* 
 Even better than the first one! Writing feels smoother; we are already familiar with the characters so the storyline engages you instantly. And then it's just insanely fast roller-coaster of non-stop action moving from one Pov to another. Hell of the ride - just buckle your seatbelts and hold on tight."
1,There is nothing I enjoyed about this.
3,"3.5 
 Though this book feels in many parts like an awkward blend of The Hitch-hiker's Guide and The Time Machine, but lacking in Adams' trademark humour and oddities (and Pratchett's, come to think of it) The Long Earth is still an interesting read. Focusing on ideas rather than plot has been pretty unusual in recent releases so it's quite refreshing to be allowed to explore all these worlds - different earth versions - without having to keep up with multiple relationships and character developments."
3,"While the dust jacket introduces us to our main protagonist, there are two boys at the heart of this story. Ryder does not believe in the witches. He is more practical than that. While he has always been such, at the start of the novel he has also taken on the responsibility of his family after his father's death. He has given up his own big dreams in order to keep the family farm afloat. Falpian is in mourning for the loss of his twin brother, and wants nothing more than to prove himself to his father. 
 The fact that these two boys play such a prominent role in the novel raises an issue I have with the cover design. At first appearance the cover appears to be a frigid winter landscape. A second glance reveals the profile of a young woman. There has been a lot of press lately about the idea of gendered covers, and how such books are perceived. I for one am fine picking up a book regardless of it has a ""masculine"" or ""feminine"" cover. Unfortunately, this is easier for women to do than men. For some reason there is a stigma against men reading ""girly"" books. This cover seems like a small, inconsequential issue. Or, something I wish desperately was a non-issue. Regardless, I fear that the design of this cover might prevent some boys from picking up this book. That is a shame. The main characters are men, something it can be difficult to find in young adult fantasy right now. Additionally, the story explores some really interesting ideas of beliefs, expectations, and coming-of-age. 
 Within the story itself, the land dispute and the Witchlanders forcing the Baens in their territory into the Bitterlands after the war present parallels to the Israel/Palestine conflict to me. I'm not trying to say that the book offers any specific commentary on that situation or bashes one over the head with one point of view; rather, that even fantasy is based in some sort of fact. Granted, the connections I draw are filtered through my own experiences (""experiences"" here being a class on the Israel/Palestine conflict). These parallels may also help explain some of the Baen's backwards ideas about women. We open an entire section with the idea that in the Baen women are not allowed to practice magic, while Falpian also informs us of the fact. However, this also establishes that differences between the two people are cultural as well. Coakley also describes racial differences between the two people. Those made me uncomfortable, and I do not know if it was my own conflict-aversion, PC world, or that I felt it was unnecessary with the other elements. 
 At times the world can seem cramped. I get that Ryder wants to protect his family, primarily his sisters, but at times the stakes feel off. For most of the book I have no real concept of the Witchlander's world. I think the third part of the book does the best at painting a vivid picture of where we are, but I'd like to see that throughout. Overall, I was happy to see a fantasy that tackled some of these big themes. I think that it could have been fine tuned a bit. I also think the jacket summary and cover could have reflected the tone and themes of the book better.

5,"Loved it, adored it, reread it and loved it more. 
 The book made me think about so many things, and I feel that with every sentence of it, it altered my thinking a bit (opened my horizons more). I was actually amazed to see that this is a debut book of the author (at least, published one). 
 The story is about a thirteen year old boy who claims himself to be devil. How the world around him react to his presence, and who is the true devil is the question that book asks with every page. I won't say it is an easy read because of the topics it covers (racism, AIDS, homosexuality etc.) but it is indeed a rewarding read."
5,"""This above all: to thine own self be true, 
 And it must follow, as the night the day, 
 Thou canst not then be false to any man."""
1,"After 40 pages I'm giving up this one. Steampunk can go either way for me, sometimes I love it, others it doesn't really work for me. Sadly this one was the later. 
 I did really like Jess's love of books, how when people would damage them he was appalled. I didn't care for Jess's family at all, hated how his father put him in danger with no thought, hated how his twin seemed to disdain him. In the end this one wasn't for me."
4,Possibly the best of the series so far. Looking forward to book 4.
4,"Still loved it, but somehow a teensy bit disappointed. Bittersweet? 
 The writing was also a bit different. But still great. 
 Maybe I'm just sad this amazing series is over? I don't know.. 
 Review to follow."
4,"At first I was wary about reading a book about a 16 y/o kid and a 30 y/o adult that was labeled romance but I'm glad I did. 
 I laughed, I got hot eyes (no tears fell :), I got upset...I basically had every emotion. 
 Faced with the same circumstance I'm not sure how I would react but love is a beautiful thing. 
 I really enjoyed this book."
5,"At some point more detailed review might come but so far I will say WOW, just WOW. 
 This series starts as fun little adventure with witty dialogues .In second book we get more worldbuilding, characters get more layers and plot thickens but it's all setting stage for what happens in this book.By far longest of the 3 it's culmination of everything that happens in previous books and I was astonished to see how some small details and side characters had impact later in story.I am also glad Sullivan didn't writer any sequels since this books has very satisfying conclusion and I hate when authors ruin good ending with unnecessary sequels."
4,"4.25 stars 
 What a creepy and swoony book. I loved it. I NEED to continue."
2,Couldn't finish - wanted to read it before seeing the movie. Was a bit slow for my listening tastes.
4,"A well written and entertaining historical novel set on Anglo-Saxon England during the Danish invations and Alfred the Great's reign. Without a doubt, a novel our Jorge Luis Borges would have enjoyed immensely."
2,"I wasn't overly impressed with this one.

 https://kirstyandthecatread.wordpress..."
5,"""I live in a world without magic or miracles. A place where there are no clairvoyants or shapeshifters, no angels or superhuman boys to save you. A place where people die and music disintegrates and things suck."" 
 Wow... just wow... so much to say I'm having a hard time narrowing it down... I'm gonna' give it my best shot! 
 The Sea of Tranquility not only surpassed my expectations... it has quickly soared to the top of my all time favorite books that I have ever read! It is beautifully written... and I was pulled into this book emotionally from the first page and stayed that way until the very end. 
 This is the story of Josh and Nastya... two young people who have unfortunately had their lives defined for them in the wake of their own personal tragedies. Josh has lost everyone he loves and he is alone. Nastya experienced an attack which affected her so badly that she longer speaks. Somehow these two are drawn to each other and as they spend time together they help each other break through their protective barriers and they allow themselves a second chance at life. 
 There are some amazing supporting characters. I enjoyed so many of them but most especially Drew... Josh's best friend. I didn't know what to think about him in the beginning but I was so pleasantly surprised at how the author turned this character into someone you not only liked but respected. He just made me smile. 
 This is a book that you need to read slowly... take your time. It is long but never did I feel that it was too wordy and everything was relevant. I found myself wanting to pause every now and then and just reflect. There were so many quotes that led me to think about life a little differently. Here are just a couple of my favorite thought provoking quotes... 
 ""People like to say love is unconditional, but it's not, and even if it was unconditional, it's still never free. There's always an expectation attached. They always want something in return. Like they want you to be happy or whatever and that makes you automatically responsible for their happiness because they won't be happy unless you are ... I just don't want that responsibility."" 
 ""It doesn't matter if you do everything right, if you dress the right way and act the right way and follow all the rules, because evil will find you anyway. Evil's resourceful that way."" 
 Aside from the healing that takes place with Josh and Nastya I was also very touched emotionally by the journey Nastya has in healing wounds with her family. As a mother with daughters I can tell you that the scenes with her mom and dad touched me deeply. My kids are wondering why I'm hugging them today... it's all because of this book! 
 I'll wrap this up by saying that this is heartwarming not heartbreaking. Well, of course their tragedies are heartbreaking but the healing is heartwarming. So... don't worry about getting attached to your favorite characters... go ahead and attach yourself to them and join them on their emotional journey. This story is all about healing, accepting and finding a way to take a chance on living even when you think it's impossible. 
 ""It's about the dream of second chances,"" he says finally. He hasn't raised his eyes from the paper on his desk and I feel him looking at me without looking when he uses his grandfather's words. ""The narrator doesn't respect the beauty of life and the world around her, so it crushes her into the ground and once she's dead, she realizes everything she took for granted and didn't see right in front of her while she was alive. She's begging for another chance to live again so she can appreciate it this time."" 
 ""And does she get that chance?"" she asks Josh while I desperately focus on the poster of literary terms on the wall and wait for absolution. When it comes, I barely hear it. 
 ""She does."" 
 Kleenex... does anyone have a Kleenex???? Just go buy the book... you won't regret it!

5,"** spoiler alert ** 
 wow. I finished the last little bit yesterday morning and I'm still getting my head around all of it. early on, I described the book as a ""hot mess of a story"" and it is (all in a very good way). The plot is a wild and crazy ride (I don't think I'd like to be in one of David Mitchell's dreams - yikes!) and the characters are so well written, I didn't want it to end. But of course I had to find out how it ended. and I cried. it was beautiful. 
 ...and not too much of a spoiler, but I found the last section the most terrifying. 30 years from now could look just like that. and I'm thinking I need to make some changes to help it not turn out that way."
4,"Was up until 2:30am reading this bad boy. So much running around my head about this book! 
 Really great book, another fantastic addition to an interesting series that seems to draw me in that little bit more with each book. 
 Only thing to say is this book would have been a 4.5 stars if it wasn't that for that bit near the very end very disappointing for me although it didn't ruin it it did put a dampener on the book for me. 
 For a full review go read someone else's because their are a ton of reviews out on this book that could sum it up better than I ever could! 
 Behind with my reviews from September as I had a week's vacation and didn't review or blog a thing and struggled to get back into reviewing since."
4,"I picked up The Girl in the Clockwork Collar after reading The Girl with the Iron Touch (yes, I'm effectively reading the series backwards), which I got for a Christmas present. I really enjoyed Iron Touch, and I was definitely interested in reading more of the series and finding out what led to the events in the third book (knowing how a certain character died, for instance). 
 Needless to say, I enjoyed Clockwork Collar. Maybe not quite as much as Iron Touch (I think it was the better book, but then, aren't series supposed to improve as you go along?). 
 I liked the world (and enjoyed learning about Jasper, Mei, and seeing a bit about Wildcat in this one), I enjoyed the romance (though not as much as in Iron Touch, but then, their characters had more time to develop by that point), and how the romance didn't seem heavy handed. Yes it plays a large role in the lives of the characters, but it felt natural and it worked. And they knew when to focus on 'hey-- there's a danger here--' rather than how attractive the other person looked. (Ah, happiness.) 
 The adventure was fun, the writing was lovely, and the characterization routinely made me happy. Plus, we get to see some fun powers (Jasper's speed), nifty devices (Emily and Tesla) and a steampunk America. All in all, an enjoyable read. :-)"
4,"I'm not sure I'll read further in this series because fantasy really isn't my genre (here there were just too many types of clairvoyants to follow and for that world to keep my interest). But I genuinely cared about this character and her journey, and this book definitely kept me riveted."
3,"I really liked the idea of this book - not the murder - but the that a girl is died and she narrates her families life as they come to terms with it, which the book was actually like, ""...Life is not quite finished with Susie yet..."" 
 The Book started amazing, the first chapter - 30 pages (or so) was really good. So intense and shocking, but after this is slowly started to change, it started to get boring - until the end- and the middle was so full of baffle, like a sandwich there would be the important point followed by a metaphor or some irrelevant past experience followed by the point again and this is good but it felt like it was all the time. 
 I watched the film about a year before and Lindsey was my favourite character because she got off her ass and did something about Mr. Harvey, In the book I liked both Ruth and Lindsey equally. Ruth had her story lines which were really interesting. (view spoiler)[ The Mother was my least favourite character because her family is falling apart and her daughter has died and she chooses this moment to have an affair, and with Len, that was kind of weak, this made me hate Len. Later she returns and everything is back to normal, except Jack doesn't know about the adultery. (hide spoiler)] 
 At the middle I was so bored of reading about this families problems I had to put the book down for a few days, I then picked it up and forced myself to read and found it slowly started to get better again. This is why I am glad Ruth had her own story that was separate to the families. I loved the end, Susie was happy and got what she always wanted a kiss and a few minutes to be grown up before sinking further into heaven. 
 There are some amazing quotes in this book and one of my all time favourites; ""These were the lovely bones that had grown around my absence: the connections--sometimes tenuous, sometimes made at great cost, but often magnificent--that happened after I was gone. And I began to see things in a way that let me hold the world without me in it. The events my death brought were primarily that the bones of a body that would become whole at some unpredictable time in the future. The price of what I came to see as this miraculous lifeless body had been my life"" This ends the book so perfectly summing the whole thing up. 
 I was thinking for a while what I wanted to rate this book 3.5 ... 4, because I wasn't a huge fan of the writing, however the more I think about it the more beautiful this book is so I rate it 4.5 or maybe 4."
3,"Lakshmi is one of the 12,000 Nepali girls who are sold into sex slavery each year. She leaves her mountain village believing that she is going into the city to work as a maid for a wealthy family. When she arrives at Happiness House, Lakshmi quickly realizes that something isn't right, and before long her horrible fate becomes clear - her stepfather has sold her into prostitution. Mumtaz, the proprietor of Happiness House, tells Lakshmi that she will have to pay 10,000 rupies - the amount Mumtaz claims to have paid for her - in order to regain her freedom. Though Lakshmi initially refuses to have sex with the customers, she eventually comes to believe that it is the only way she can earn the money to buy her freedom. Then one day she gets an American customer who offers to help her. Lakshmi has heard that American are deceptive, promising to help girls like Lakshmi only to leave them begging in the streets, but Lakshmi wonders if the chance of getting out of Happiness House is worth the risk. 
 Written in verse, Sold is a quick read, but the subject matter is by no means easy. Lakshmi's situation is horrifying; however, McCormick is rarely graphic in her description of the treatment that Lakshmi endures. She focuses instead on Lakshmi's emotional state and the relationships that she forms with the other residents of Happiness House. Though she is at times on the brink hopelessness, Lakshmi maintains her determination to escape her circumstances and find a better life. Overall, this was a very worthwhile read. My only criticism is that the ending, though hopeful, may be a little unrealistic, and it left me wondering what lay ahead for Lakshmi."
3,Was quite disappointed with this book :/
1,"The Redbreast is book 3 in the Harry Hole series. It is a well known, popular and award winning piece of crime fiction. It was selected by my IRL book club to represent Nordic Noir. I don't usually like skipping to the third book in the series, so I did read The Bat earlier in preparation for this. (I didn't like that book really either so I did skip book 2) I really did not like this and only one other person in the book club persevered and finished. Everyone else quit, some relatively early on (first 100 pages). The storyline is convoluted and time switching is rampant. Characters are introduced willy nilly all over, with name changes. There is a pretty eyebrow raising coincidence involving a female police officer and the cases they are working on. Harry Hole is your typical alcoholic with issues police detective. The book spends a great deal time on the historical (WWII) piece and it bored me to tears. The resolution is tied up by a series of diary entries basically retelling the book and it is over 500 pages long..."
4,Could not put this volume down. The connections between characters grew so well. And the first page. Holy frak. I can't wait to see how it continues.
5,"Seen at Bookish Antics! 
 How do you end one of the best YA series out there? Barry Lyga has written a perfect conclusion to the I Hunt Killer series, one that made me want to reread the series from the beginning after finishing and just sob because it was that amazing. I didn't want to say goodbye to Jazz, Howie or Connie, but Lyga made parting with these characters a lot easier by giving me complete closure. Blood Of My Blood lives up to its ominous title with a plot that is as gory and action-packed as possible; I'm in awe of this book and I wouldn't have wanted this series to end any other way. 
 I'll refrain from summarizing this book in fear of accidentally spoiling even a minuscule plot point. Jazz is trying to stop Billy Dent's reign of terror and that means he has to kill the King Crow. This book taps into a lot of the recurring messages of this series: Does nature win over nurture? Are children doomed to turn into their parents? Can you ever right something so wrong and evil? This is my favorite novel in the series and it managed to give me everything I loved about the first two books, while still introducing exciting new elements. 
 Lyga is an excellent writer that much is obvious after reading Blood Of My Blood; this novel is deliciously creepy and is filled with such dark, intense imagery. Even though Lyga writes for a YA audience, he never holds back from making this book as bloody and twisted as humanly possible. It's scary how genuine Billy Dent and the other serial killers feel in this novel and Lyga never skims over the horrifying details that occupy the lives of serial killers. To say this novel is well-researched would feel like an understatement, Lyga truly captures the unhinged insanity of serial killers. 
 Our trio: Jazz, Connie, and Howie have grown leaps and bounds since they were introduced in book one. It's a world of difference looking at these characters at the Blood Of Blood and where they were originally in I Hunt Killers; sure, the gang is as witty and lovable as ever, but they aren't the same characters they once were. The character development in this series is absolutely incredible and is unrivaled by the majority of YA series that I've read. The best way to describe the characters in this series is that they're Whedon-esque, few storytellers have managed to create such complex characters like the ones Lyga wrote for the I Hunt Killers series. 
 Blood Of My Blood was the ultimate ending to one of my favorite series and I absolutely loved everything moment of this book. This is the best book in the I Hunt Killer series by a long shot and everything about the plot is perfectly calculated and executed. I'm ready for anything Lyga throws at readers next and I just know that it will be engrossing and unforgettable. The I Hunt Killer series are the perfect books for viewers waiting for the next season of NBC's Hannibal to roll-around; once you start Lyga's series, there's no stopping!"
3,"OK,, lots of build up and Charlee's backstory as to why she was ""freaky"" was a little weak. I've really enjoyed Reyes's books, including the other two in the 5th Street series, and while I love Hector, this book was the weakest in the series."
5,"This book. This book is so complicated. There is so much emotional baggage that I couldn't help but been drawn to it. Even In Paradise has so much grief, its crazy. And sooner than later, I found myself nearing the end of the book. It was so easy to get caught up in everything this book had to offer. 
 The writing in this book is really smooth and coordinates really well with the story. Seamlessly Charlie, the MC, has woven her way into the Buchanan families heart. The Buchanan family loves Charlie, and Charlie loves them right back. She really does. 
 Charlie is an unique character. Quiet and shy, she only has a few close friends. With Charlie being so quiet all the time, she observes a lot of people. Charlie's also wicked smart and wise upon her young years. 
 The main character is Charlie, but the main story itself is about Julia Buchanan, and how Charlie fits in with the Buchanan's. The Buchanan family is a close knit group and has had a tragedy strike them. The Buchanan's seem lost and emotionally distant. And when Charlie comes along, she (Charlie) really distracts them all from their pain. 
 Even In Paradise blew me away with its soulful writing, the emotionally charged characters. In the end though, its Charlie who brings them a sense of home. Charlie somehow worked wonders on that family. 
 Even In Paradise really reminds me of We Were Liars though, to be honest. 
 *Is on the trigger list because of: Car Accidents that result in death."
4,"I personally love the art work from ATLA series and comics more than TLOK, the bright and bold colors. 
 The part 1 of Turf Wars just sets the reader up for the next challenge that Korra will face, after Korrasami's return from their sojourn. The book reintroduces you back to the story and its characters. It spend few parts on their coming out to their friends and family quite well. 
 One cannot review this in full without seeing how the story will pan out in the next 2 parts."
4,"I was surprised that so many threads were left hanging out there in this one. I call it the 'Evil Book', since I really didn't like some of the turns the characters made. 
 Ian and Rollo are always a good time and was glad to have them throughout. Not a fan of William, he seems to have missed out on Jamie's fun gene."
4,"Alice felt she hated that word. ""Interesting"" meant that you attracted the notice of men who would hurt you to possess whatever they found ""interesting"" about you. 
 Ah, Alice is a dark, dark spin on a classic literature, Alice in Wonderland. Under the guise of a fantasy retelling, Alice actually tells a darker story of gangs and sex trades, in a world where women are constantly taken, raped, and sold (which to be fair, isn't that far off from reality). It touches heavy themes like rape, sexual assault, mutilation, and slavery. So here's a trigger warning for readers who cannot stomach such brutal topics. 
 ""I took his keys and threw him down the stairs. That's how I knew the steps were on fire,"" he said. 
 I didn't find the narrative to be super compelling at the beginning, but it definitely got better after the first half, and from then on it's just action, suspense, action and suspense. So the story is about Alice, who is locked in a mental asylum along with a fellow patient the next room over, Hatcher. One day, the hospital is set on fire and both Alice and Hatcher escape, only to find herself entangled in a quest to destroy the dangerous and powerful Jabberwocky. And in her quest, she slowly recovers the memories she has been missing and finds out about her dark past. 
 Of course, along the way, she meets familiar characters from the original fairytale, only that these characters have been transformed into dark, twisted, violent and dangerous antagonists. And it is very interesting to see classic characters reimagined to something so wildly different and morbid. 
 Highly recommend avid fans of Alice in Wonderland to give this book a try."

3,"** spoiler alert ** 
 The enthusiastic buzz on this one had me go find it and read it. I very much enjoyed it. I'd never read anything by this author (though I knew her books as they are so popular among our students) and felt she had a firm and easy/breezy style that was very appealing. 
 I liked the structure, the creepy journal, the quotes from the news and such. But I did feel that it was a bit overstuffed with characters, some of whom were better developed than others. (For example, the grandmother barely factors in and I did feel that Bliss's background didn't matter as much as I would have thought it would. I was probably expecting something more on the lines of Korman's Schooled. In that book, the boy's homeschooled and isolated background has a lot to do with who he is. In this one, Bliss seemed to adjust very easily and her background seemed to matter little to her existence at the school. Kids were pretty accepting of her.) 
 At first I thought the journal was the popular girl's. I was a bit disappointed to learn it was the poor outsider girl. I dunnoh --- just wish she hadn't been so stereotypically awful --- fat, smelly, creepy, hopeless mother (where was her father?), dreadful to her cat, and so on. Bliss who should have been the outsider was quickly and easily made an insider. And her new friends were incredibly accepting of her friendship with poor Sandy. And is she nice, Bliss, to sleep over in that awful place? I had a hard time suspending disbelief by then. 
 Fun indeed; I agree."
5,"I knew that AFTER would be a tough novel to read, just from the first line inside the dust jacket... ""WHO would leave her own baby in the trash can to die?"" 
 Before even picking up the book for the first time, I became intrigued when I saw an interview with Amy Efaw on YouTube. She explained her own encounters with what she called the ""Dumpster baby"" phenomenon and mentioned a few real-life cases that inspired her story. While I've read a handful of YA novels on teen pregnancy, this seemed to be such a sensitive topic that I definitely wanted to give it a try. 
 The story centers on Devon, a model student and star soccer player with a very perfectionist Type-A personality. Her teachers adore her and her coaches constantly brag about her abilities, so nobody ever expected her to be locked up in a juvenile detention center, charged with the attempted murder of her newborn baby. 
 While the novel begins right after the pregnancy and flashes back to the actual incident, the majority of the story focuses on Devon's stay in the detention center and her trial to determine whether she will be tried as a juvenile or as an adult, with the possibility of life in prison. 
 There's no doubt that the most graphic scenes are hard to read. We get glimpses of a teenage girl delivering her own baby on the bathroom floor... stashing the baby in the bathroom sink while she mops up her own blood... throwing the baby in a trash bag to hide the evidence. But, please be aware that while these sensitive scenes are difficult, there's nothing exploitative here at all. Efaw actually accomplishes what one may presume to be impossible... to give a real live human face.. one that may even inspire sympathy from the reader..to what we would assume to be the monster behind this horrific act. 
 I think I'd describe AFTER most as a memorable book... one that I would definitely recommend to anyone."
3,"I picked up this book as a last minute purchase in an airport bookstore. The kids were getting gum and had Pippy Longstockings to listen to on the ipad and dammit I wanted a book to read! Scanning over Wenches, various Dean R Koontz novels and the collection of feel good ""literature"" that is offered by these kind of shops I had given up any hope to find anything interesting and was about to resign myself to buying some crappy vampire murder mystery just to pass the time when I was Across the Universe. It was just different enough from everything else on the shelves to peak my interest, and while my curiosity was rewarded with a fine story perfect for an airplane ride I was disappointed in the missed opportunity the author had with this book. 
 Across the Universe focuses alternately on the story of Amy, a normal girl from Earth who was accompanying her parents on an intergalactic exploration by being cryogenically frozen during the trip and Elder, the teenage future leader of the descendants of the staff who were housed on the ship during the 300 year long journey. When Amy is mysteriously unfrozen and nearly dies she is forced to join the world upon the ship fifty years earlier than expected. The story is intended to be a young adult combination of sci-fi, dystopian culture, romance and murder mystery. While I would say that Revis has an excellent story and a vivid voice she falls short in her ability to create the mystery or romance necessary to propel this novel out of the common and into the amazing work it could have been. 
 Without giving the story away I will give you one example of what I mean. Some of the crew, those considered the ""crazy"" people on the ship are given a medication to control their mental issues. These pills are called ""inhibitors"". What's the first question you would ask when hearing that? Mine was: Well, what are they inhibiting? Not exactly rocket science to figure out much of the plot from that little nugget alone. 
 In format the story is told in the first person voice, alternating between Amy and Elder and while not my favorite technique it does work to help the reader understand the struggles and isolation Amy feels as well as get deeper insight into the culture Elder was raised in. The world created in this book is strange and confusing, but familiar enough to have a haunting effect. The ship is run by a dictatorial system where the leader, Eldest, has total and complete control over the people. Earth's history has been rewritten and historical figures such as Hitler are seen as leaders to be emulated and revered. Elder, being the next in line as leader is privy to some of the secrets of the ship and its history but not enough for him to understand the depth of Eldest's tyranny. 
 The anthropological aspects of this book into issues of leadership, control and free will are the most interesting. I was pulled into the world of the ""Feeders"" and ""Shippers"", the strange behaviors and the mystery of those on ""inhibitors"". I thoroughly enjoyed reading about the world and some of the minor characters like Harley (an artist who ultimately commits suicide upon learning he would never reach the destined planet during his life time) and Luthe (a would be rapist who suffers no consequences from his actions and is never heard from again after the incident...dropped plot line much?) but overall the relationships in this story were the weakest part. 
 The romance between Elder and Amy is lacking in every way. The only connection I can see is that Amy is alone, unfrozen to early without her parents or anyone else she knows, and Elder is the only person who listens to her while Elder is isolated as the future leader and has no one else his age on the ship. I see nothing about their interactions that speaks to more than friendship. Any furtive glances or emotional connection are so framed within the ""last man and woman on earth"" concept it's hard to believe that there is any real love between them. Instead what you have is a girl desperate for anyone to connect to and a boy infatuated with anything different or exciting in his mono-ethnic, classist existence. 
 Across the Universe is a fine book and if you are a connoisseur of Young Adult novels you might well like this one because it is better written and more complex in theme than most. If you are interested in sci-fi, Revis does an amazing job describing this future world and the technology used, she has clearly put in a great deal of research and thought into the hows of her world. Also, as a dystopian world life aboard Godspeed is a perfect test case. However, if you are looking for romance this is not it and if you are looking for a deep mystery that will surprise you in the end, well you will be sorely disappointed. I figured out who the ""murderer"" was and his entire back story by about the fourth chapter without difficulty, it was clear as day, much like the ""inhibitor"" pills. 
 So while I wouldn't recommend it as something that will change your world, it's a fun book, and if you, like me, are just looking for some fluff that is different and engaging go for it. But when you're disappointed by the lack of depth and sophistication in the story don't say I didn't warn ya!"
5,"I have a love and hate relationships with novellas. This was a total win for me though even with the ending being what it was. Anyway our favorite couple is dealing with another friends wedding, while a birth later on. Which brings them to take a big step in the right direction in there relationship. That was until of course Simon gets in a accident across the country that scares the hell out of Carolina. Making her of course go to him as soon as possible. 
 And through the accident more sweet moments and drugged up Simon makes me give this book all the stars because I simply loved it. However I would love to see the reaction more in full from Clives little discovery and Simons reactions."
5,"I thought it was very good. I like all the characters, because they each have their own unique personality. The only thing wrong was that most of the characters seemed like the characters in the Percy Jackson series."
4,"This earns one more star than the first volume, entirely because of that adorable giant teleporting dog <3 Can I have one please? I still love Kamala's personality, though I can't wait to see her ""grow""/mature a bit. The inventor was incredibly creepy and I was definitely surprised about what was really going on. This was a good comic."
5,"Emily is homeless and busking in the subway for money. Logan has quit college to help pay for his brother's cancer treatments. Neither are living the life they have dreamed of. Both have secrets they would like to keep hidden. 
 Loved Logan and Emily's story from start to finish."

 This book was even better second time around! Probably because I knew what to expect so I didn't feel like I would die of anxiety attack every other chapter and could properly enjoy/feel all the tiny details/emotions of this story.

3,"Great backstory. We get all the good and essentially none of the bad. It was quick, short and sweet. 
 I have to say, though, as usual the guys here are all cavemen. Smothering and controlling, which would never work in real life, but apparently these women they find are ok with it. Whatever works, y'all."

5,Rachel Vincent is becoming a favorite author. The first part is slow to start and still seems to make the most mundane tasks interesting. I love the characters and hope jace gets some feminine attention in the next book.
4,"I packed a few books to read during my vacation and found this one in my suitcase from last year's vacation---unread. So I kept it there, thinking I couldn't possibly ever get to it this year. But I ended up in the hospital for days and had plenty of time to read it! Fate! 
 I devoured it in two days, as it was difficult to put down for a minute! As with all Amy Tan novels, I tear through hungrily, only stopping occasionally to ponder the web of connections she makes, and then I end up crying and satisfied. I'm always more into my mother afterward! So this novel helped me appreciate family more--appropriate for a vacation for a family reunion!"

2,"I didn't enjoy this book as much as I could have. My husband got it for me, as one of the ACs I still don't own. But when I read the backpage I realised I have seen the film and I know the whole story... Remembering the details, it wasn't an enjoyable book - unlike Murder on the Orient Express or Paddington 4:30 or Death on the Nile - all these I love to re-read, even if I know full well what's going to happen on the next page. 
 This book was somehow flat, the cues too few, the evidences poor - it wasn't plausible at all how Poirot could guess who the murderer was. 
 Can't wait for Sophie Hannah's new Poirot novel though!"
5,"Tijan never ceases to amaze me. I love her writing, I became a really huge fan of her work. 
 About this book of hers... I'm madly in love with Logan Motherfucking Kade. If he lives in the real world, pretty please, tell me where he is, because I totally want a Logan for myself. The story was action-packed, heartfelt and I felt heartbroken, lonely, happy, turned on, and in love so many times throughout the book, I can't even count them, but that's what I love in Tijan. She makes me feel all kind of emotions. 
 Taylor was a fitting heroine for Logan, smart, witty, brave and beautifully broken. I loved her. She was perfect with all of her imperfections, and I think that's what made Logan fall for her. But in truth, I fell in love with Logan because of his imperfections too, so maybe it was vice versa for Logan and Taylor. 
 I can't really write more without spoiling anything, so I'll make this review short. 
 Thanks for this experience. 
 P.S.: This cover is freaking hot!!"
3,"I really liked the first 3/4 of this book, it was a really good story. For some reason the last bit of the book felt like a real let-down and I'm not sure why. 
 Is it because it's starting to feel like a formula? ie. Mercy goes off on her own without Adam, gets into a situation, Adam gets mad and rushes in to save her even though Mercy has handled it? Or is it because story points are brought up and not explored very deeply? Or maybe I was just distracted by trying to keep the new puppy from chewing up everything in sight. 
 Usually I love Mercy Thompson books but in several places during the story I felt like I had missed something, a book or a lot of background stuff. I may try re-reading this one someday but right now I'm just a little disappointed in it."
4,"*Minor spoilers throughout* 
 3.5 stars. This turned out to be sort of a frustrating read for me. It started beautifully. Tana French has a gift for writing, and I kind of wish she had put it to use on a different subject. For a murder mystery it reads like poetry half the time. Which is pretty impressive considering she's dealing with such a grim subject. 
 The characters are all wonderfully human and flawed and full of life. The friendship between Cassie and Rob started out as something beautiful and wonderful and rare. Sam was adorable in his own childish way. And the result was that the actual investigation sort of took a backseat to the relationships between the characters. Which sometimes sort of sucked. We witness a lot of dinners and a LOT of drinking. (By the way- can someone clarify for me whether the Irish really drink that much?) 
 The murder investigation itself wasn't all that interesting. Most of the stuff Sam did wasn't relevant and you and Cassie and Rob sort of knew it all along. The twist really wasn't much of a twist. I don't know if French really believes she had us fooled (Rob actually says this, ""she fooled me, and she fooled you too...."") or if it's just something thrown in to make us understand the depth of Rob's... well I don't know what you would call it. Naivete? Betrayal? Gullibility? Vulnerability? I'm not sure. I guess vulnerable is probably the right word. Don't get me wrong, it isn't that the twist wasn't good enough, it was that French wrote the culprit's character almost too well. Who knows- maybe I've come across this sort of thing myself before and you just know it when you see it. Maybe I've just watched too much Law and Order. 
 What kept me turning the page was the expectation that the old case would get solved. It never seemed like the two cases were related at all, but Rob kept going back to it, and weird things started to unravel, and I was expecting some supernatural horrifying conclusion to it all. I really, really, wanted that part to be solved. More than I wanted for Rob to stop being such an idiot and fix stuff with Cassie, I wanted his friends to be found. I wanted him to remember. I wanted to know why at least three witnesses heard that strange sound in the woods. That's what it's called right? ""In The Woods""? Wouldn't you expect for that thing that happened in the woods to come to some conclusion? Well it doesn't, and if that's why you're reading than go ahead and put the book down or don't start it at all. You'll be left just as frustrated as I am. 
 I can't help it. I'm drawn to the supernatural and that was half of why I picked this book up. I think the second book in the series is also supernatural sounding and I probably won't bother with it because I have a feeling those threads won't be explained either. 
 I gave it four stars for the characters and the writing, which as I said several times were really wonderful. But when you get right down to it, my personal opinion is that the story itself kind of sucked. It's more a commentary on the human condition then it is a story, which is fine, but not what I bargained for. I saw a few reviews where people said they were heartbroken or sad about the ending, and truthfully I don't understand why. I think the whole point is that Rob is fucked up. As he should be. Everything points to this. Rob is fucked up, Cassie is too a little, but she dodged a bullet and came out happy. And for that I'm happy for her. I have no sympathy for Rob after how he treated Cassie. Why should I be sad? Sure I'd have liked to seen them together in the end, but he did it to himself, and I can only feel so much sympathy for things people do to themselves. That's life. 
 Anyway- if writing and characters are your thing this book is probably for you. If mysteries are your thing then you should probably stay away. The strange supernatural elements were just window dressing to hide the basic everyday run of the mill mystery plot. And lots of the time it felt like the detectives were sort of going in the wrong direction the whole time. Their leads and lines of inquiry felt thin and flimsy, and as a result the middle became kind of boring and tiresome. I might check out ""The Likeness"". But I'm not rushing to pick it up anytime soon."
3,"I must say that I liked Stargirl a little bit more than I liked this one. There's just something special about the way Stargirl lets us see this unique character through Leo's eyes. That doesn't mean I didn't like this one. Quite the opposite actually. I enjoyed the characters who got to meet Stargirl Caraway, in particular, Alvina and Dootsie. Dootsie absolutely cracked me up in perfect 5-year old girl style. :) I'm very glad that I read these."
4,"Pi is a 16 year old boy when the ship he's on sinks, along with his family and the crew. He finds himself in a lifeboat with a variety of his family's zoo animals-- including a Bengal tiger. He is telling his story to an interviewer, looking back on his journey. The story combines a castaway/survival story with some zoology and spirituality, as Pi practices three different religions in order to ""love God."" It's an extremely interesting and creative tale, although I didn't have the stomach for all of the survival aspects of it."
1,"This disappointing sequel to Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children has none of the subtlety, mystery, charm, and psychological depth of the first. There may be some interesting things going on with Emma and Jacob, but it's drowned out by the lumbering, frustrating plot. 
 The story is a journey tale, a particularly difficult structure that is prone to a lethal weakness: delay. If all the characters want to do is get from point A to point B, then all the adventures they can have are just delays. Delays in fiction are the same as in real life: they are frustrating, annoying, they get in your way. And when the delays are mostly caused by the stupidity of the protagonists--""Yeah, I know I'm supposed to be hiding from people searching the beach for me, but instead of going into the cave with everyone else I'll just snog my girlfriend for an hour in plain sight""--the frustration is doubled. Time and again, just at the moment they are going to make progress, the progress is snatched away by another delay. They probably could have dealt with this delay, with their peculiar disabilities, but that doesn't occur to them until it's too late. At one point all they want to do is get on a train, and we have a lengthy delay while the man at the ticket window won't sell a ticket. Overcome that, and we are delayed by the conductor, who won't let them on the train with a bird. Overcome that--with some commendable ingenuity, I should add--and then the men with guns show up to snatch the victory away. Because the moment there's a weapon, they surrender. 
 This is the only book I have quit reading in the middle of the climax. It was too excruciating to watch the heroes stand around and watch until things go bad, and be unable to walk across a room, while the bad guys miraculously appear instantaneously just where they need to be. 
 Ugh."

Do you gasp and thrill at death-defying stunts and punch your friend in the arm when they survive again? Do you burst out laughing at the smooth, eyebrow-raised sarcasm that pierces the tensest standoff? 
 Turn on the lights. You need them to see the pages. 
 I hate to compare a book to a movie. I'm a firm believer in the wisdom of this T-shirt. But Laurell K. Hamilton packs more fight scenes, more blood, more dead and undead into this book than any summer blockbuster. 
 Guilty Pleasures is a quick-paced, incredibly compelling introduction to vampire hunter Anita Blake, the Executioner. You feel this book. You rocket up with the adrenaline spike. You feel your pulse quicken, your breath go shallow. Then you fall back down when the threat is gone, the adrenaline leaves, and your knees go shaky beneath you. It's a wonder the heroine doesn't have a heart attack, but I'd be right in the ambulance beside her, albeit less blood-splattered. 
 What a heroine! Anita is by far one of the strongest first person narrators I've ever read. Anita is beautifully realistic. She's a tough fighter, and she thinks about her fighting. Hamilton shows incredible insight into the fear-anger-stupidity-obligation-nerve-fear-revulsion-strategy-and-did-I-mention-fear when facing a terrifying enemy. Anita debates and chastises herself and hates being short and makes snappy, snide remarks that spark an audible guffaw. She wrestles with a moral obligation that is purposeful and demanding. Very often when reading, you think to yourself, ""I wouldn't do that."" or ""Don't open the door!"" With Anita, you understand that she has to open the door. It's who she is. She may not like it, but she does what she has to do. 
 In addition to our favorite vampire hunter (no, not Buffy), Guilty Pleasures introduces a cast of characters you know will appear and evolve in the upcoming books. There are hard-nosed cops, mindless ghouls, giggling girls, gun-shooting girls, newspapermen looking for leads, and were-animals eating at Denny's. And of course, there are vampires: dangerous mind-manipulators, sultry strippers, and reserved church-leaders. Vampirism is main stream. It's a bright (dark?) spot in St Louis's tourism. 
 Given all that... sorry, but I must mix business with pleasure. This was a fun read, but occasionally the word choice was repetitive. The exact same phrase or word (""fear"" for example) would reappear one too many times. One more edit would have theasaurized that puppy out of there. Not a big critique, but it can bump you out of an otherwise smooth storyline. 
 I know I'm slow to board the Hamilton train. Guilty Pleasures was published in 1993, and there are (holy moly) twenty Anita Blake books now. Like all good readers of series, I stared with the first. I look forward to the blood-curdling, blood-drinking future. 
 P.S. I think Hamilton's recent tweet, just as I was finishing the book, epitomizes what kind of author she is and what kind of heroine she's created in Anita : 
 ""Took Trin shooting for first time. 50 rounds all 7 ring or closer in; we are very proud of our girl. .22 bolt action, single shot."""
4,"I generally steer clear of Nicholas Sparks books. I don't want to read the sad story of someone dying tragically from terminal cancer or the contrived drama. There's enough drama in life already. No, I didn't see or read ""The Last Song"" but that may have had more to do with the starring actress. So I was hesitant to read this book and I was pleasantly surprised and delighted. I think I missed the subtle wisdom Nicholas Sparks infuses in his books. 
 What this book offers is articulation of the middle age mind returning to ""what if..."" If you've never wondered how your life would be if you'd taken a different path, you've not hit middle age yet. He deconstructs the romanticism of first love without destroying it. He also reframes family relationships then subtly uses symbolism to describe the difficult process of accepting reality and describing two broken people. The Stingray represents Dawson, at least in my mind. My favorite quote from the book, I believe comes from Amanda's mother who says, ""The grass isn't greener on the other side, it's greener because you water it."" 
 Sparks also provides a glimpse into different coping mechanisms dealing with tragedy. All of the characters experience profound loss in their lives. There is blaming, finger pointing, and pointed accusations but ultimately, those who flourish are the ones that accept the reality and continue to live. 
 It's a quiet story except for the extreme violence Dawson's kin engage in. Dawson is from the other side of the tracks but doesn't fit in with his criminal family. The attention grabber is that Dawson claims he has been having hallucinations. An apparition of the same man continues to show himself at key moments in Dawson's life that ultimately save it. Dawson doesn't know what to make of it and the paranormal flavor was interesting and mysterious, although not central to the story throughout. It is a key part of the conclusion, however. 
 Overall, I really loved the wisdom Sparks uses in understanding and articulating the adult developmental stages of middle-age through his characters."

 ""What can I say? With you I've always been easy."" 
 ""With me, you've always been adored."" 
 London Legends rugby star Ash Trenton isn't sure what he is going to do once he retires but coaching at a camp for troubled teens wasn't on his to-do list. Not until an old lover shows up out of the blue asking for his help. Though it's been eighteen years, he finds he can't refuse the first and only woman he has ever loved. 
 Camila Morale was sixteen when she and Ash spent a summer exploring their love for one another but he had to leave to start his rugby career and she never heard from him again. She was left with a shattered heart and a very difficult decision to make. She never planned on seeing him again but she needs his help to save her camp from financial ruin and the only way to do that is for him to coach her team to victory. 
 Coaching kids who don't want or care about the sport is hard enough but trying to ignore the attraction and chemistry that burns between Ash and Camilla is even harder. When Camilla begins to fall for Ash all over again, she fears that once his time at the camp is over, he will once again choose his career over her. 
 Taming the Legend is heartwarming contemporary with just the right balance of humor, emotional heart pinches, and some steamy romance. Well plotted with engaging dialogue and personable characters, the story sweeps you up with no hesitation. Second chances love with miscommunication as the villain is a tricky trope combination. To often the miscommunication ends up being something that could have been cleared up with one conversation. Luckily, Latham isn't one to drag out conflict nor employ manufactured drama in order to capitalize on the angst that often goes hand in hand with this trope. Her characters are quick to communicate and resolve past problems in order to move forward. 
 Delightfully humorous and flawed characters open up their hearts and feelings to the reader. It's always enlightening to see a story play out from two different sides and Latham gives us that through Ash and Camilla's POVs. Written in an enjoyable conversational style, the laugh out loud dialogue blends well with some serious scenes that will keep you entertained and engaged all the way to the end. Latham takes her time in giving us insight into this couple's past relationship and the reasons they separated. Youth, circumstances beyond their control, and some external forces came between them at a time when communication was much needed. Feelings were hurt on both ends and only when they meet again does the truth reveal itself. 
 A camp for troubled teenagers is the perfect gateway to reintroduce Ash and Camilla to one another. A lot has changed over the years but the chemistry still blazes strong. Camilla hasn't had an easy time of it; from childhood to now, she has had to fight small town gossip and a very low self-esteem. Ash's ""betrayal"" was the final nail in her coffin and Camilla went off the deep end. This camp saved her life in more ways than one which is why she swallowed her pride and seeks him out to beg for his assistance. 
 Ash never forgot about Camilla but in his defense, they were young, it was only for the summer, and he was already committed to rugby-something he never hid from her. He's a sweet, funny, intense man who, when he learns what happened to Camilla all those years ago, genuinely grieves for her, him, and their past. I appreciated that he dealt with one of the external forces that kept him from her in a realistic and timely manner. 
 While the actual commitment was slow to build, this second chance journey is refreshingly honest and fun; not overburdened with emotional tripe and drawn out anger. The sparks between them are bright and hot; enhanced by Ash's dirty little innuendos. Camilla feels the connection between them but the past weighs heavily on her mind while Ash wants more but knows his time with her is brief and doesn't want to cause her any more pain than he already has. 
 Taming The Legend is another enjoyable read by Kat Latham and a wonderful addition to the series. Fans of sport themed contemporary romances will enjoy the heartwarming coming home feel of Latham's newest couple. 
 RATING: B"
3,"Not bad but not as good as the other King books I have read. Much better than the movie made of it, but still not very convincing in parts. I find that to be Kings great strength, he gradually builds up and eventually has you believing in the impossible."
1,"I don't usually use the ONE star rating, but the characters were quite bland and uninteresting. I felt that the author jumped right into the plot without providing me with any ""oomph."" I felt that this book was less creepy and just plain grotesque. I felt that the book dragged on for me, but I kept reading in the hope that it would get better. It certainly didn't. Just not my cup of tea.

3,"A harrowing story about love, vengance, and, as always in classic literature, marriage between cousins. But seriously, the moral is that one cannot have both love and revenge in their heart."
5,"One of my favorites so far of the Lord Peter Wimsey mysteries. It's set outside Wimsey's usual sphere, filled with biting satire of office life, and for me was a bit disappointing only in its distance from my favorite characters, Bunter and Harriet Vane. 
 It felt much darker than the earlier novels. There were more deaths than usual, some quite casual, and a lot of unhappiness for some characters. That said, it had me laughing aloud in parts, and the resolution of the investigation was very satisfying."
2,+1 star for the birth scene.
5,"The stories were all very different and fun. SA by J.A. Konrath was SO hilarious. Some were sad. Some were funny, some were sexy."
5,"If it weren't for the fact that there wasn't A LOT of Kenji and James around, I would've hated this novella because ADAM. But I LOVED IT OKAY I DID DID DIDIDIDIDIIDIDIDIDIDIDID"
3,"Wow. I'm curious as to how many times Kristen Ashley can churn out the same book, where the only differences are the characters' names and occasionally the location of the setting. My bet is 28."
4,"Ok but not as compelling as Flynn's other books. 
 It was good to finally get Rapp's story. 
 (view spoiler)[Even tho he wasn't a major character, it was sad to see Richards offed. I would have liked to see a little more emotion from Hurly and Rapp over that but ok (hide spoiler)]"
3,"Started really slow and ended really slow for me. 
 Liked the conclusion, but I feel like there was so much missing about Nate and everything in the end was kind of glossed over to rush to the HEA. 
 I wanted to know more about the club and the estate. I felt like there was so much missing back story sacrificed for more sex scenes at the end. 
 Maybe I'm alone, but the ending felt a little hollow to me. 
 Loved Jett and Brooke over all though."

 Prose/Language: 4 stars 
 A very good book about 1930's anthropologists in New Guinea caught in a dangerous love triangle. 
 But there was something a little ... off ... I couldn't put my finger on it at first. Something was keeping me from falling in love with the book and now I think I know what it was: it was too well crafted. The story and prose felt as if it had been refined over and over to the point where it lost all its jagged edges. You know how plastic surgery looks a hyper-real? The face is objectively beautiful, but something doesn't look right. That's this book. A friend used the following phase to describe this kind of aesthetics in literature, ""It reads like an MFA."" 
 I don't want to discourage anyone from reading this book if the premise sounds appealing to you. Read away! Just don't be surprised when it plays out exactly as you expect."
2,"Not a great follow-up to her previous series. This book is pretty long, but actually quite thin on plot. A lot of the plot points are nonsensical contrivances. The main character is kind of a stick-in-the-mud and isn't really likeable, and there isn't a strong mystery plot or romance to keep the book going."
3,Whoa. Whoa. Wtf happened at the end there?!?
4,"Eimear McBride's debut novel is not so much stream of consciousness as a diatribe against the world and its cruel, senseless ways. A relatively short book, every sentence, every breath is punchy and stays with you long after you've turned the final page. I heard about it on the Women's Prize for Fiction shortlist (a prize it ultimately won), and I am happy to say that I picked it up. Reading through the comments here and elsewhere, it is clear that this is a book you will love or hate. In truth, there is no room for half-measures here, and McBride makes absolutely sure of that. 
 The nameless protagonist is a woman, followed from early childhood to her early twenties, growing up in Ireland in a Catholic family and growing up in the shadow of her older brother's brain tumour. It is a deeply personal account, fragmented and exceptionally well put together. McBride's nameless narrator is swept up by her brother's illness and it's incredible to see how the 'voice' changes from that of a child, barely understanding what's going on, to that of a teenager, (view spoiler)[a victim of her uncle's sexual abuse (hide spoiler)] to that of a young woman, confused, scared and utterly alone. It is an utterly alienating experience, and one that you feel every step of the journey. The end, when it comes, is both shocking and expected, almost the normal progression of her trajectory. 
 Normally, this sort of book would have an immediate five star rating from me. However, I just couldn't bump it higher than a 4, a 4.5 at the absolute most. There was something about the main character that just didn't quite gel with me. I was largely sympathetic -- her abusive, guilt-tripping Catholic mother and her constant need for religious reassurance, her largely absent father and her brother, dealing with disability, fits of rage and a sister who tries to be both close to him and live her life independently of her stifling family -- but sometimes some of the main character's choices felt downright bizarre and senseless. It was jarring and I felt thrown out of the story, despite trying to cling to her thought processes. But then perhaps it's simply a lack of experience: I have never had a sibling suffer from cancer, I have never had to deal with this level of Catholic guilt and I have never felt this aimless in my life. 
 Would I recommend this? I would, but be prepared to be battered, be prepared to be confused and hurt, and be prepared to experience a female voice entirely distinct from those in modern fiction. It is a book that touched me deeply (like The Lowland, long ago, due again to its sibling connection) and one that I feel should be talked about more. A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing is an experience, and one that you won't soon forget."
5,"Comparative literature note: this 1968 book bears similarities to Junichiro Tanizaki's ""the Key,"" written in 1956 but not translated into English until 2004. (Many people say ""Hunger Games"" also has a Japanese precedent, but I digress...)

 apprently, like [Book: Catcher in the Rye], this is a serial-killer book-- i.e., one of those books serial killers like"
5,"i am two books away on finishing this series and i have to say this one will be my favorite... 
 so Plague the book title speak for itself the FAYZ has been attacked by a mysterious plague that is killing all the mutant kids one by one. 
 the book is filled with blood,gore and graphic violence, which the whole series is known for. but this time it seems really different cause i get to see the characters in this book in a whole new light, and they are progressing in a way that shocked me. 
 the booked wrapped up with a plot that really keeps me going and would want me to keep on reading the entire seriea until the end. yeah....! let's go find out what will happen to the kids of FAYZ."
4,The Sun Also Rises is probably my favorite Hemingway so I really liked the scenes of the real people the characters are modeled after.
2,"I was bored to tears with this. 
 Sorry but not sorry, I couldn't enjoy this. Boredom, pure boredom. Dull and empty. Tedious and uninteresting. I'm not even mad! I need to feel the MCs' lives are exciting in all their mediocrity. But I couldn't connect with them in any form. I couldn't understand why they fall in love with each other. They are totally forgettable because they didn't start any emotion. The story is just blah. I have to think really hard to find something I liked, but I just don't want to do so. All in all, Sara Alva is not my kind of author."
2,"There was absolutely nothing interesting about the first half of this book and I pretty much predicted what was going to happen even before the half way point, which deflated my enthusiasm since that took the intrigue out of everything. It picks up eventually, but for me it was too little too late. 
 Justine's narrative was absolutely unbearable for me a lot of the time, and I think this book would have benefited from being in 3rd person and switching from multiple POVs because I really didn't care about her at all. Where's the fun in her playing catch up? I could see if it was for a chapter or two, but the first half of the book is spent on this. At least everybody else saw some action, but unfortunately we only hear about it in passing. 
 The atmosphere of this book was very different from the other two where there was more action, gore and grit. There is a ""mystery"", but it was solved in book 2, so Justine piecing it all together is tedious. I'm aware that I am in the minority, but the romance angle in this series does absolutely nothing for me so that didn't help matters. I would have rather had more disillusionist, high cap and cannibal action than to have seen her juggling between her feelings for Packard and Otto. Bo-ring. We knew where it was going to go, so I just wanted the story to get it over with so that it could move along. This was more about the melodrama with an ending that was too ""perfect"" for my tastes. 
 The first book is still my personal favorite. It was really fresh and original to me. This book just doesn't hold a candle to it since you could take out the UF and disillusioning aspect and it would still essentially be the same book. 
 Based on the merits of the other two books, I still think Carolyn Crane is talented and creative, but this entry makes me hesitant to immediately jump right into her next series. If you've read the other two books, then of course you should finish it out, but for me I probably would have been less annoyed by reading a summary so that I wouldn't have wasted my time."
5,"This book was really interesting, much more interesting than it sounds from the blurb."
5,"First, I LOVE Haruki Murakami. (Gosh, his name is so much easier in Chinese.) It's my first time reading his work in a language other than Chinese. (Unfortunately, I don't know Japanese.) I quit reading his books in Chinese halfway through 1Q84, mostly because I don't really get the new translator for his works.(It had always been one Chinese translator who translated all his works, and I liked him very much.) But I found my interest in his novels again by reading in English. I've been reading Murakami's novels since my pre-teen years, and reading his words again, even in a different language, brought back so many memories. I used to sneak out in gym classes to read his novels in the bookstore, I even got caught once. (How I wish I was better at it back then.) So this book contains a certain kind of nostalgia for me, and it brought tears to my eyes as every single Haruku Murakami book before this one. I just hope he keeps on writing, so I'll always have something to turn to when I need this kind of comfort."
4,"Three and a half stars, rounded up to four. This story is loosely based on the real life woman Sarah Grimke and her sister, Angelina. At the end, the author's note explains which parts were pure fiction, and which real events and even real quotes. The Handful and the other slave characters were all the author's inventions. Still, the story reads very true to history. It follows Sarah and Handful from the age of eleven and up throughout their lives. 
 While I did enjoy this book, there were parts that were lacking. I felt the characters grew, developed, and achieved what the author had set them up for mid-way through the book. Consequently, the latter half seemed drawn out, and a little pointless. I didn't know what the author was trying to achieve, since it seemed the story could have easily concluded in just the first half. 
 I found parts of the book to be very repetitive. (view spoiler)[ Sarah's speech impediment and tiring love life were themes that never changed and were just repeated almost verbatim throughout the book. (hide spoiler)] 
 Overall, the story is very compelling, and a realistic look at life in the South during the early 19th Century. I loved how the main characters were strong women. The author's theme of women's rights and abolitionism being tied together was very strong. I hope this book gets made into a movie, so a larger audience can experience the journey. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for their next quick read!"
5,It was SOOOO GOOD. I loved it so much and can't wait to read the rest of the series

 Hunting Ground 
 picks up shortly after Cry Wolf. Briggs' takes her time with these two and their (view spoiler)['so, our wolves are mated' (hide spoiler)] human mating process. They are both slowly, but steadily learning how to read each other and get closer to one another. One thing that is evident throughout the story - they will do whatever, whenever, to whomever that is necessary to protect the other. Seeing Anna become stronger and Charles open up is a joy for A&O fans. I love that Anna is able to surprise Charles with her strength. ""Seattle is a city with a certain ... panache. Never know what you are going to find when you come visit. Good food, friendly people ... Always something different."" Bran, in his determination to out the wolves to the general public, has been frustrated with Charles. Bran is set to meet with other Alphas in Seattle and Charles feels it's too risky. So, Charles goes in his stead along with Anna by his side. While there, they meet some interesting and some twisted weres, one intriguing fae and some wickedly talented witches."
4,"*Since I'm on my mobile device at the moment, I may add more to this review later. * 
 It's official. McKenzie Lewis is the master of escape. Hot damn this girl is lucky. I really thought she was going to bite the dust more than a handful of times. Thank goodness for some Aren healing love. I'm not sure what kind of good luck charm McKenzie was rubbing throughout this novel but I hope she lends me hers. 
 On a side note, whatever happened to Kyol's family heirloom? It was mentioned a few times, I know it was shoved in McKenzie's back pocket, but never mentioned again. Hmm. Or was this some type of foreshadowing? 
 Also, that ending was pretty shocking. Not cliffhanger shocking by any means but still shocking. I can't wait for the next book in this series. I'm addicted."
4,I really enjoyed reading this book. I found the storyline intriguing. I liked the characters. Just an overall good read.
4,"I really enjoyed this book. I liked the protagonist. I wasn't really sure of her age. Usually in urban fantasy books like this one the protagonist is early to mid twenties but I think Harper may have been more in her thirties. That, or she doesn't have a problem with dating people much older than she is who she believes to have a teenage son. 
 I really liked all of the second tier characters. They were fun, interesting, and seemed to have some depth. 
 I do have a few concerns though. First, I'm a little tired of the protagonist having to be just a little more special than everyone else. She's not only supernatural herself, she's the extra special kind. But all the other urban fantasy books are doing it so it's not fair to single out Kat Richardson. 
 I did wonder more than once if this was a manuscript that had been worked on for several years and not updated. There were a couple of minor but glaring things. Most people would not use a ""floppy disk"" to transport programs these days, they'd use a USB Flash drive. Hell, some computers don't even have floppy drives anymore. There was one other general thing, which escapes me, it may have been a reference to videotapes rather than DVDs. 
 I'm from the Seattle area so there were a few irritating things there, too. Safeco Field was named in June of 1998 but is only referred to as ""the new baseball stadium"" in the book (twice). I'm not sure she really gets the feeling of the place either. If it weren't for a couple of landmarks I wouldn't have known it's Seattle. Yeah, there's a lot of coffee being drunk, but no mention of Starbucks, SBC or Tully's. And at one point she mentions the city continuing to get rich off sin, which I don't get. Maybe if you're talking heroine use, but she was talking about strip clubs and I dare you to try and get a strip club started around here. There was an illegal ten year moratorium on them that just ended and they're still fighting about it in court. It says in her bio that she's a recent transplant from CA and I think maybe she just hasn't plugged into the culture all the way yet. 
 Still it really was quite an enjoyable read and I'll definitely read the rest of the series"
5,"I'm outing myself - when I was younger, I tried very hard to learn elbish. Fortunately, I failed. 
 There was never another storyteller like JRR Tolkien, and there will never be."
2,"I was really surprised by THFJ and not in a good way. It read strictly marysue-wish fulfillment from beginning to end. At endless points, secondary characters would pause to regard how amazing the protagonist was and he never had to face any consequences of any action. Instead, he was gifted with the ""perfect pitch"" of cuisine and never fussed to pass any of the tests. At one critical point, a strawman villain monologues about how perfect he is. 
 The whole book was shallow and disappointing, which surprised me given the buzz and word of mouth."
1,"Beastly is probably one of the most popular fairy-tale retellings. After reading Cinder and Scarlet by Marissa Meyer, I fell in love with this genre and Beastly sounded like an interesting retelling of Beauty and the Beast. Sadly, it was a disappointment and a complete waste of time. 
 Kyle Kingsbury is a typical teenage jerk and I have no sympathy for jerks. He's rich, cocky and very pretty and he's used to getting anything he wants. He was neglected by his father all his life, but I don't think that's an excuse. He's such an unlikeable character, rude and evil, I could hardly continue reading the book. But I knew this was part of the story, so I kept reading. My main problem was that I hated him so much in the beginning, that when he became a furry beast, ugly and pathetic, I felt no compassion towards him and it would be actually fine with me if he stayed like that forever - he would deserve it. 
 The love story wasn't my favorite either, to put it mildly. Lindy is a very likeable character, but I still found her shallow. She's an average-looking, bookish and smart girl, so it's easy so identify with her. Her life isn't that pretty with her father being an addict, so she wants to study hard, get a scholarship and escape the ugly life. What bothered me was that she had a crush on Kyle before he became a beast, just because he was so pretty and even though she knew he was a douchebag. In a young adult novel that tries to point out how external beauty isn't everything and that what matters most is personality, I thought this was very wrong. It would be much better if Lindy despised the beautiful Kyle because he was a jerk. There are people who put personality before the looks, but Lindy turned out to be just another shallow girl. 
 With Kyle turning from a character I hated to a soppy romantic (which I still disliked) and Lindy a shallow teenage girl, I didn't care much for them. Will, the blind tutor and Magda, the housekeeper, were probably my favorite characters, at least they were normal, good people. The story also had a distinctive contemporary feel to it, with lots of references to sex, especially from Kyle's part, which I probably don't even have to say how much I disliked. I really, really don't like it when female authors try so hard to create boys who are so stereotypically boyish and consequently jerks. 
 Luckily, the book is pretty short and fast. It doesn't have any deeper meaning and it basically even fails to convince readers how physical beauty isn't everything, which I thought was the point of this story. I don't think I'll read any other books by this author.

2,"Son of a bitch. 
 I was so certain that I was going to stop after this one that I put volume 4 in my bag before leaving for work today. I was going to stop at the library on my way home, drop them in the book drop, and not even think twice about it. 
 I don't like her. I just don't. Either as Kate, or as Batwoman. She's boring, which, seriously, no super hero is supposed to be boring. There should be a law. 
 And this storyline has not held my interest. It should have, but we started off so weird with the drowned woman and children, and then Bloody Mary, and all of a sudden there's a crocodile, which...what? 
 They're using the term urban legend, but I've only ever heard of Bloody Mary. Are we supposed to equate super croc with the alligators in the sewers? Because that's stretching. 
 When I realized Wonder Woman was coming in, I got a little excited. I picked up the Wonder Woman volumes my library has at the same time as these, and I figured I'd get a sneak peek into the type of character she was. Not even Wonder Woman could save this. 
 So, I barrel through to get to the end of this book before my second break was over, and I'll be a motherfucker. (view spoiler)[They bring back Alice. (hide spoiler)] 
 Son of a bitch. Guess I'm reading the fourth volume after all."

 *Beware of possible SPOILERS* 
 Well...the cover of this book looked smutty and reading the synopsis on the book didn't change my mind any. I was told by others that read it that it really wasn't--they lied or forgot or something!! This book was competing at the Smut Olympics. Now don't get me wrong, I think smut definitely has its place and I don't mind reading some from time to time. But I like my smut to have at least 40-50% storyline...this book had like 10% storyline and 90% sex. 
 Merinus Taylor is an aspiring journalist that comes from a family of seven brothers (apparently their parents had plenty of sex as well) and her father who are all reporters. Merinus's father received a package right before a woman he knows died. It details experimentation on humans involving genetic engineering. She explains that she was a surrogate mother for one of these beings, Callan Lyons, a genetic hybrid of a human and lion, who escaped the evil Genetic Council that created him. He was made to be a killer, but he just wants to be free to live his life in peace. This lady wants the Taylors to go to him and help guarantee his safety by making public what was done to him so that the government and public can put an end to the labs that are creating creatures like Callan every day. 
 Merinus is obsessed with Callan and thinks this could be the story that makes her career, but her family thinks it could be too dangerous and would rather keep her at home on a 'safe' story. But luckily her oldest brother, and usually the most protective, Kane, agrees to having her take it on as long as he accompanies her. 
 Kane and Merinus travel several hours to where Callan lives and study him. She doesn't think Callan sees her or knows who she is, but she's wrong and they continue to play little games with each other pretending they don't know who or what the other is for several weeks. 
 Then, Merinus gets an anonymous tip on how to reach the road to Callan's house that she has been unable to locate. She follows the directions the caller gave her, but ends up lost in woods. When she goes looking for help she finds trouble instead in the form of two mercenary soldiers. Callan and his friend (a fellow experiment), Sherra, get there just in time to save her from being raped and most likely tortured. 
 Callan now knows that Merinus is in danger and must do what he can to protect her from his enemies. 
 But neither of them expected the unexplained and insatiable attraction they have for each other. An attraction that forces them together to stop the physical pain they are both experiencing while apart. It is a mating frenzy (kind of like a dog in heat) that none of his pride knows much about, but it will change both Merinus's and Callan's lives forever. 
 Where oh where to begin? First of all I really don't understand why Merinus's supposedly over-protective brother would leave her alone and encourage her to make contact with this dangerous beast while he's away when he's supposed to be there to keep her safe. You would have thought if he had to leave, he would have dragged her back with him. 
 When reading this synopsis of the book and looking at the cover I thought the breeds would be a kind of genetically engineered shape-shifter, but they actually have a human looking form, but just have some of the feline traits that come out in them. 
 This book was way too sexual for my liking and I found the writing to be a bit crass at times. I can't stand the word 'cunt' and it was probably the most used word in the whole book. It drove me insane. There are others ways that Leigh could have gotten her point across. And, I absolutely hated this whole ""submit to me"" ""no you submit to me"" argument that Merinus and Callan kept having. He was very 'you Jane, me Tarzan' throughout a lot of the book and insisted on being the dominant party of the relationship. Which OK, I get it...it's the alpha lion genes coming out, but it didn't stop it from being annoying. I found Merinus to be really stupid. She knows Callan is fighting himself to keep control and from letting his beast nature take over so she teases him and pushes him on purpose to try to make it come out forcing him to nearly rape her at times, which drove me crazy. Also, I found her character to be weak and obnoxious. She is one that is always the damsel in distress. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good male lead swooping in and saving the day, but I don't want that male lead to ALWAYS have to swoop in especially in this case when most of the times he comes to her aid is because of something stupid she has done. 
 Overall, I didn't like this book that much, but it was a quick read. I think if it wasn't one sex scene to another (with little to nothing in between) and that whole domination thing it may have been a different story. I need more than just sex for me to like a book and I felt I was reading the same things over again and again...oh wait I was they just had slight variations from scene to scene. The 'creamy frothy cunt juices' were just too much for me, but if you're looking for something to read on a lonely day to yourself and want to get your blood pumping (among other things)...this may be one for you. 
 I'll probably read the next book in the series eventually and hope it's better than this, but if they don't improve I'll forgo the series for something better. I mean as many people that love this series it has to get better....right?"

 One of the great classics of the 20th century... well, a statement like that will definitely get anyone interested in reading it. Many of you read this in school, but naturally I missed out on this one as well. This one is not only on the BBC Book List but the 1001 books to read before you die. 
 'For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened - then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.' 
 I thoroughly enjoyed the writing of F. Scott Fitzgerald; it was by far the best part of the book. I had a major disconnect with the characters as I found them to be quite shallow and pretentious. The whole story seemed off for me; but I think that was just the overall oddness of the characters themselves. 
 My impression going into this book was that it was to be a great love story... how Gatsby loved Daisy but the war came between them. Daisy, becoming tired of waiting for Gatsby to return, marries Tom who's a loaf of a man that cheats on her quite openly. 
 Now I understand this is a book not set in the 20th century and women were supposed to all be stay out home mothers who took care of the house and the children and kept their mouths shut so I naturally didn't expect her to get fed up with his cheating and hit him over the head with a dinner plate, but I really did expect more. By the end it all felt a tad anticlimactic and there was a resounding 'So... what was the point?' floating through my head. 
 All in all, I'm glad to have read it so I can now say that I've read it, but that it's definitely not going down as one of my faves."

 *Spoiler alert - Some plot spoilers ahead* 
 Far From the Madding Crowd was a book club read for me. It had been on my to-read list for a while so I was excited to start reading. Only...it wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be. I have a friend who loves the book, loves everything about it, but I just...didn't. Really the big problem for me was I really disliked the main character so she kind of ruined the whole thing for me. 
 This is the story of Bathsheba and the men who fancy her. The book opens with Oak, when he meets her, and his proposal of marriage. She of course turns him down, but in such a way that I did almost enjoy it. There were moments, like her refusal of his proposal, that made me think oh, this will be fun. But they were few and far between. Anyways, she turns him down and goes to run a large farm that was kind of left to her. It is there that she meets Boldwood and Troy and where most of the story takes place. 
 So Oak is the guy who is always there. He was the only character I actually liked at all. The only one who didn't get crazy jealous. He wanted Bathsheba to be happy, whether that was with him or not. He also had no problem standing up to her when she would try and be mean to him and talk down to him. 
 Then we have Boldwood (who I always read as Bollywood for some reason so he was this kind of crazy guy for me, which turned out to be quite accurate). He doesn't really have any interest in Bathsheba until, on a lark, she sends him a valentine. Then it is all over for him as he must have her! Ridiculous. 
 Then finally we have Sergeant Troy. The guy who rolls into town and immediately starts telling Bathsheba how beautiful she is and all that. He was the real charmer and obviously not at all sincere. He also has a lady who he really loves on the side (though she is not in a good way when we do see her again). 
 So Bathsheba. She was so incredibly vain and self centered I couldn't stand her. It was always me me me and she didn't really seem to care for others very much. She would be horrible to Oak for no good reason and he would just leave. He always came back when she asked, but still. Then she falls for Troy because he fawns all over her and tells her how pretty she is and stuff. There was one line before she meets him when Boldwood is leaving town for a bit that was like if only he (Boldwood) had told her she was beautiful. Like if he had maybe she would have agreed to marry him and everything else wouldn't have happened. I did not care for her. Way too self centered for my tastes. 
 So of course everything falls apart eventually, how could it not when you decide to marry the dishonest Troy? Then Boldwood goes really crazy - that was a strange scene and seemed to come a bit out of left field, and so she is left with Oak. No one else is around to marry her so it end a bit anticlimactically and to me not too happily. With her finally saying well, I guess you will do since I have no other options. Sad for Oak as he seemed like a good guy. 
 Now one thing I will say that I did like about the story is the author seemed to be way ahead of his time. A woman who runs her own farm? Who doesn't need a guy to do so? At the time this was written it seems like it wouldn't have been looked upon kindly. Like Hardy is progressive in his writing. And not very subtle with his words. The title indicating they are out in the country where no drama would be, only to have a ton of drama. Oak being named Oak and being the strong silent one. All of it. I quite enjoyed the writing, I just wish I would have liked the main character more. I will have to give another of his works a try and see if I enjoy it more."
4,"It was a bit too technical for me, but still a good story. I think it will make a great movie."
5,"I swear that Marie can do no wrong, and each of her books just gets better and better. I think I may like this story more than I like Strawberries for Dessert, or at least as much, since it's like comparing apples and oranges in subject matter. Jaime's fear is heart-breakingly real, and Levi's patience doesn't feel contrived, but legitimate, as do Levi's trials with his family. 
 I love how the title finally comes into play, too. (I say this because I know Marie often stresses over her titles. This one's great.) 
 Highly recommended if the religious aspect isn't off-putting. It's well-treated, and it does end well."
3,"Annoying - I read this ages ago, and then somehow didn't move it off my library list so I ended up checking it out again. At least it seemed familiar enough by the first pages that I figured out what had happened. 
 So, going on my memories of a few months ago, the thing that impressed me the most about this book is that the author made a good faith attempt to get some complicated and thorny questions and issues out there for examination, related to young women and how they view their sexuality. Sex, on its own as a thing, is fine. You don't have to be embarrassed about liking sex. You don't HAVE TO be in love with people you choose to have sex with, and you don't HAVE TO have sex with people you love. It's easy to confuse sexual intimacy and emotional intimacy. Sometimes sexual intimacy and emotional intimacy go hand in hand. You can regret having sex with someone without meaning it was someone's fault. 
 It's challenging, I'm sure, to get that all into a narrative format, but I admire the effort. It was a fine read, but I wish, a bit, that the protagonist wasn't so whimsical and that her special guy wasn't quite so special. This story might have worked even better had they been average people."
5,"As I said before, I wish I had a book like this to read when I was a teenager. I picked it up because there was no lesbian young adult fiction when I was coming of age and had a difficult time finding a reflection of myself and what I was going through in books that were geared toward me. Like everyone else, I turned to Rubyfruit Jungle, and Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistlestop Cafe, and while they were great books, they failed to reflect my life in my lifetime. 
 Cameron is a very believable character. She discovers her desire for girls at age 12, and while she has thoughts about it being wrong or against what is expected for her, she is unapologetic. She initially blames herself when her parents die, but her grief outshines her own shame. When her born-again aunt steps in as her guardian, she is defiant and more self-assure. 
 Emily Danforth doesn't shy away from the topics that make young adult novels often bland and safe. She tells it like it is. Cameron's desires are plainly laid out for the readers, and are very real. She spends less time as a confused kid, and more time seeking out other gay friends, and making out with a variety of girls. She smokes pot and shoplifts and breaks into abandoned buildings. 
 I was really impressed by this one."
5,"This book had me hooked from the start, it was a total page turner. I only put it down once and that was to sleep, because my eyes were stinging and starting to go blurry due to the late hour. 
 The characters were brilliant even Buck. If you are looking for a touching story then look no further this is it! You may even learn a self defended move or two.. I'm a huge fan of the lawnmower, god help any man who may try to attack me in the future. I'll have Erin's voice in my head screaming ""NUTSACK"" LOL."
4,"I read Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise in High School. I didn't care for it at all, so I wasn't expecting to like this one. 
 The story was sufficiently engaging, but what stands out is the way he describes things - vivid and clever and beautiful."
5,"Why I gave this book five trillion stars: 
 Time travel. 
 Action. 
 Time travel. 
 Love. 
 Time travel. 
 Internal conflicts. 
 Time travel 
 World-saving. 
 Time travel. 
 Overall hero-ness. 
 And of course: TIME TRAVEL."
2,"Slow. Dragging. I didn't care for the switching back and forth of perspective, and I had a hard time caring for the characters. Still, objectively it's an elaborate conceit well handled, and I need to go find the next book just so I can see what happened, but of all the persephone-like novels out there lately I cared for this the least."
4,"I liked this. A lot. 
 Facade hit the mark for me with a story about two young adults learning to deal with loss, only in this second book in the Games Series, the circumstances are not exactly typical. Both are working through an incredibly painful situation, and the reader gets very close to their agony in this book. 
 I personally like the deep point of view that we get from Adrian in this book, although it is sometimes hard to take because his wounds are so very raw. When drugs,alcohol and all night parties no longer provide the release from his pain (more like avoidance, really) his struggle intensifies. Then he meets Delaney. At first he's just looking for a one-night stand, but as their relationship progresses she starts to mean something to him. He also doesn't know how Delaney is linked to him, setting up for a huge moment in the story. 
 Delaney is dealing with loss too. Her family has fallen apart and all she has is her brother, Maddox, who tries to help her realize that she can't fix the situation they are in. But Delaney doesn't listen, and she falls for Adrian, knowing that it will probably mean heartbreak for her when he finds out the truth. I loved Delaney's innocence and her belief that she could somehow make a difference. (ps. I wanted to smack her mother upside the head.) 
 This is a very poignant story, full of heartbreak and sadness, so if you choose this be prepared. There's a bit of repetition of their thoughts, but it didn't bother me because it seemed natural for their circumstances. If you've ever experienced this level of grief, you know that it just doesn't go away, and it come back to haunt them both, over and over. That might be cryptic, but I don't want to spoil. I wasn't expected the big reveal from Adrian near the end, and it made his situation all the more heartbreaking. 
 It was good to see Cheyenne and Colt in this story as well, and I was thrilled to read that Maddox will be featured in the next story, because that boy has some issues he has to deal with as well. So it was a nice setup for the next book in this series. 
 This was a beautiful story of how people can accept and move on from really bad things that happen to them and how you can learn to live with the consequences of the past. In the end, I thought Delaney did make a huge difference in Adrian's life and she helped him move to a better place. The book ends on a very upbeat note, making this journey all the more sweet. 
 If you like deep, emotional stories this might be for you.

5,"Very fulfilling since surprisingly, it was very historically accurate (apart from the vampires of course)."
4,"Bought this on sale at Diesel (80%-off) or I might never have given it a shot. Having only read a few other books by this author, I can't say if it was typical of her work. It wasn't sappy or angsty, and no complex world-building that some writers try to shove into an unsuspecting reader's head within the bounds of a novella. Instead there's mohawk-wearing pirates, an oppressive regime, and a fetish-loving protagonist shocked out of complacency into spoiler (view spoiler)[the kind of happiness he never dared dream of (hide spoiler)]."
5,"LOVE LOVE LOVE! 
 I was laughing out loud constantly. 
 I also don't feel so bad about hiding in bathrooms at parties. 
 This is the perfect book for cheering yourself up. 
 Update September 2015: I'm now listening to the audio book. It is making me love the book, and her, even more. 10 STARS!!!!"
4,"As the novel begins, a woman who looks like Leah is found almost dead at the lake near the house Leah is renting in western Pennsylvania. Leah has been getting threatening phone calls and emails. She thinks someone is watching her house. And she hasn't seen her friend and roommate Emmy in several days. In fact, it seems that no one in the town has seen Emmy. Ever. There's no evidence that Emmy even exists. 
 The story weaves back and forth between the past and the present, slowly revealing both Emmy and Leah's friendship and Leah's reasons for leaving Boston as Leah searches for clues to Emmy's current whereabouts. It was hard to determine if Leah's recollections could be trusted, or if she was an unreliable narrator. 
 The Perfect Stranger was a page turner, and Ms. Miranda had me guessing from beginning to end. There were so many questions. Was Emmy real, or some figment of Leah's imagination? Who was harassing Leah? Was any of this tied to the woman found at the lake? And why exactly had Leah left her life in Boston so quickly? 
 The Perfect Stranger is a fun, suspenseful read, full of twists and turns along the way. I was sure I had the answers, but in the end, it turned out I was wrong. 
 Visit Hidden Staircase for my full review. 
 Many thanks to NetGalley for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."
5,"LOVED! A little conflicted about the ending, though."
3,Pretty good. The story is interesting but not really believable. But that's exactly why I love reading. To escape from my boring reality. Sex was off the charts hot so I will definitely be reading more.

 Brought to you by OBS reviewer Omar 
 Cat's Lair is nothing more than a story about trust. Trust in yourself, trust in others, and most of all trust in love. But what can a person do when she has built barriers, kept her head down, and tried to go unnoticed; all of these to be undone by a man that has made his mission to save her from a monster that is hunting her and the world that is trying to use her for their own gain. Everything, while trying to redeem his lies. 
 Author Christine Feehan brings us a new story of her Leopard series. This time with leopard Ridley Cromer and the young fugitive Cat Benoit. Cat is a barista in a cafe, which has turned quite popular lately, and at the same time training in self-defense in a local dojo. To which Ridley is the new instructor in her dojo and the most Zen person she has known. But after the first few chapters you will notice that both of them are hiding something. Cat is running, again, from a man that has been the monster in her life since she was eleven and Ridley seems to be more than what he claims to be, he knows so much of everything and asks questions he shouldn't, but worst of all Cat has a friend for the first time; a friend that can die if He finds her. 
 After an event that leads them to Ridley's ranch in Texas, their carnal passion goes up in flames. As seen in other of the Feehan's books and series, the passion of her main characters is always high. It seems to me that in Cat's Lair, Ridley and Cat burn, a lot, for the need for one another. Cat, who has never loved or felt this passion for another man and doesn't know what to do, and Ridley feels a strong connection, almost a claim for Cat and can't get enough of her. So know that the book contains scenes of their passion, lust, and burning heat as the Han Vol Don (mating heat) happens. 
 I know that dominance is a strong characteristic of the male leads of author Christine Feehan, but I felt that Ridley was a little more dominant than the other leopard shifters of the series and he also looks more in tune with his leopard. But I liked how Cat didn't easily trust Ridley after she found out about his lies. 
 I liked the cover of the book, and I think that it portrays Ridley's tattoos and power quite well. The story doesn't specify his tattoos but the cover gives you an idea of how they look. 
 For the fans of this series, you can see Jake and Emma Bannaconni from the previous book Burning Wild. We also see Joshua Treje and Elijah Lospostos from another previous book. You will see how much Ridley has more in common with these and other characters of the Leopard series, as his name *spoiler* is not Ridley. 
 I really liked Cat's Lair and the idea of leopard shifters. I have read Christine's Dark series and as you know there are Jaguar shifter there, too, but I don't think that they exist in the same world. As Christine Feehan doesn't do crossovers between her stories. 
 If you are a fan of any of Christine Feehan's books, I recommend you to read Cat's Lair from her Leopard series. Here you will meet two people torn apart by lies, but brought back together by their passion and the need to keep one another safe from all. And a story where forgiveness is hard to earn.

4,"This book was something else it sure did keep me on my toes. I think I'am literally one of the last people to start this series, it has had so much hype. I have had this for over a year and haven't felt like picking it up until now. Mainly due to the interesting film trailer for this. The film looks amazing and more than what I thought the book was which was a hunger games rip off. As I'm seeing the film tuesday thought it would be better if I tried to read this before hand. 
 I should of hated this book (I will come to why later),but I didn't I found myself reading this non stop. At work in between breaks, at home last night I spent all night reading this. What What What!!! 
 One thing this book is is addictive and defiantly got me hooked within a few chapters. 
 I won't go too much into the story as I think everyone has read this but me. 
 The one main thing that bothered me with this whole book was the society that Roth had created would defiantly NEVER happen. EVER ! 
 I had a hard time believing that people would just happily accept belonging to a faction and just act like everybody in the faction. No way would that happen. To be honest I think we would all be divergent if this ever did happen. How a person can only be one trait ! Just the whole concept seemed so not believable. But that doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy this I should n't have. One thing that I did have whilst reading this was questions heaps of them about why this society is this way. Like it is never mentioned really how this came to be that really bugged me. 
 This book did something to me : The plot would never happen, the daultless were idiots not brave but yet I couldn't stop reading. I found myself really becoming immersed in this world. I really cared what happened to Tris our main female heroine. 
 I think that is where this book succeeds is that,every character in this book you want to know what is going to happen next to them. 
 Tris or Beatrice as she is formally known is a breathe of fresh air. She isn't straight away unstoppable or the best at everything. She starts off quite weak and not that amazing at all. Which made me care about her more I found I really liked her character as there was many depths to her. She didn't rely on a guy to rescue her all the time. She was a very strong real character. Who develops through the book. 
 Four who is the love interest I really loved too, he is not all teen angst moody. He has a lot beneath the surface too. What I loved about him was he didn't try to control Tris at all. 
 I loved how their relationship built up slowly and was very real. I like how it developed over a period of time they really were a great team. The romance really was only in the background, it really does not take over was the right amount. 
 What I loved about this book is that this is shock after shock. I never knew really what was going to happen in the end. There was also quite shocking bits where I was like WHAT just happened. 
 What I'am about to say may annoy some people but I liked this slightly more than the hunger games. I don't know why but this felt more fun and exciting to read. Maybe it is because it's so unrealistic and unbelievable that I enjoyed it more. Who knows but I can see why people are obsessed with this series. 
 Will defiantly be continuing with the series and hope the film is as good as this."
4,really interesting premise. audiobook is great.
5,"Wow. I had never heard of this book or of Pickard, but I'm glad something about it grabbed me in the library. The first night I read the first 60 or so pages (basically all the history of the night of the murder). When I tried discribing just those first 60 pages to my mom, I found that so much had already happened it was almost impossible to tell her. It's not your average mystery, but it is tightly woven and full of suspense and anticipation. I highly recommend this page turner!!"
5,"I have a lot of thoughts about this, but nothing I can really wrap together to make sense of. 
 Was it a good story? Yes. 
 Were the characters likable? Not always. 
 It took a minute to draw me in, but once it did - I was pretty much done. It was like watching a car crash, you know you shouldn't be curious, but you can't look away. That's pretty much how I felt for 95% of this story. I couldn't stop listening, but I didn't know why. 
 I wasn't really rooting for anyone to ""win"" but I wanted everyone to get what they deserved, if that makes any sense. I think it'll only make sense if you've made it through the story. 
 The story was just winding enough that I couldn't predict what was going to happen, but just predictable (? I don't have a good adjective here) enough that I didn't feel like the events came out of nowhere. 
 It was a nice, refreshing story for the season."
2,"(Literati Book Club-November pick.) The number one reason I did not like this is because I could not care less about lace. The whole book revolved around 16th century France and King Louis ban on lace, a commodity more highly regarded than gold. It wasn't believable--even if it is based in truth--the way it was presented made me angry. The language was very flowery and I could tell that it was supposed to be ""lace-like"" but it wasn't fulfilling. I could tell that the purpose of the flowery language was to go along with the theme of lace in the book, but it wasn't giving me the intricacy that I wanted/ that lace is supposed to have. 
 The second big problem I had was that I did not care about any of the characters we saw--6 characters, the lace maker, her sister, a dog, a boarder guard, a young woman who has to pay for her life in lace, a man who is in love with the young woman, and the count--so many people, none of them really stood out or made an impression on me. They were under developed. I had high hopes for this and I'm sorry they fell through."
4,"Aaaargh! That ending!! These books are both absolutely wonderful and annoyingly frustratinat the same time. I want to both hug and strangle Maggie Stiefvater for ever getting me started on these stories. I gotsta know what happens!!!!! 
 I also really really hope there is some way for Blue and Gansey to be together without him kicking it, I love them together, their relationship has really grown and developed as the series has gone along, and The idea that their relationship might kill him is kinda heartbreaking. 
 I know a lot of people are shipping Ronan and Adam, but I don't really want them together, I quite like Ronan now and I can't work out how I feel about Adam, I'm still waiting for him to snap and go on a killing spree or something. 
 I absolutely love the cover on this book, I had to have a few minutes to sit stroking the cover before I read it, and I had a picture of it on my iPad about a month before for me to stare at. Pretty pretty pretty."
5,"Oh my god THIS BOOK. Absolutely the perfect conclusion to an incredible series and I loved it so so much. I was planning on reviewing this, but after reading it I just can't. I've loved these characters for so long and I now already miss them like hell <3"
5,"Being the last person on earth to read it, I don't feel I can say much in the way of a review that will help anybody! I liked it... lots of loose ends (many I had completely forgotten) tied up, lots of angst resolved. Of course, anybody who invested in reading Vols 1-6 couldn't help but want to read this, and nobody who hasn't read Vols 1-6 would make sense of it, so there's really no recommendation here, except to say that the 7 volume series is worth the time invested, right up to the final Muggle joke."
5,"Until about a third of the way into this book, I didn't think it was that great. I thought it was another of those books that I'd enjoy, but I wouldn't get the hype about. But I get the hype now. The characters are amazing and the friendships are amazing and the focus on that (and family, of course) is amazing. And having suffered with depression myself (I still am suffering, tbh) it really meant a lot to see it so accurately portrayed."
4,"3.5 stars 
 One thing I really liked about Lawhead's retelling is his fully fleshed out villains. We flip back and forth between Bran and the villain POV. Count de Braose is a very good henchman to the crown with complex flaws, and the lengths he went to surprised me on occasion. Some of the villains are strong and ruthless and some of them are weak and cringing, but in a totally believable way. Lawhead's villains are individuals, with individual motivations and allies, and I really like that realism. I feel like my taste for Paul Murray Kendall's complex historical characters carried over here into my liking of Lawhead's Norman characterizations. 
 One thing I particularly like about this book is that it's a more full-blooded kind of fiction that I'd love to see more Christian publishers dealing with. Bran has an understated faith arc, and the author is able to stay true to the rough-and-tumble soldier's world he thrusts us into. Lawhead deals with subtlety, and I like the variety that offers. Perhaps in fantasy it's a little easier, but this book reads like historical fiction, so as a writer of straight historical fiction, I like seeing his style on the market. While you will find brief instances of language/crudity and mature elements, it's not overwhelming to the good elements of the book. As a friend said, ""adult Christian fiction without being cheesy."" That sums it up perfectly. 
 Merian had the inner arc that sticks out to me most as I write this review. We start the book with her and Bran carrying on a borderline mistress relationship (though for those concerned, the beginning of the book is the most intense and never goes too far). Then as we go further, her romantic struggles get more and more complicated. No one else knows how deeply grief wounds her heart when Bran disappears. But as she goes on and meets different characters in the cast, she finds herself struggling with feelings she never expected. Her mother warns her against falling in love with the English, who are trying to take over Welsh lands. Merian has no intention of doing so, but her father keeps thrusting her and the rest of their family into the company of an English baron, and Marian can tell that the baron is eyeing her instead of his wife. Very slowly, she starts struggling with feelings for a Englishman, and a married man at that. And without really drawing attention to it, Lawhead writes a very good portrayal of a woman with whom life went differently than she expected, who had to struggle against an attraction she probably would never have wanted to deal with in the first place. It's a small side plot in it all, but I think it's Lawhead's most in-depth and skillfully drawn character in the story. 
 On the minus side: After Rosemary Sutcliff, I admit I'm spoiled for anything, but I thought the descriptions were bland and would have liked a more vivid connection with the deep forest Bran enters. Somehow the forests and waterfalls and rivers didn't grab me this time. There was nothing to make me hold my breath and linger in wonder, and in a fantasy that's what I really want to see. I'm a proponent for a fully fleshed out world. 
 Also, while we have a close connection to Bran's thoughts in his struggle and rebirth scenes, the author switches to omniscient view in the latter half of the book as Bran begins his upward climb to save his people. That sucked the personal stakes and foreshadowing out of the climax, and while the stakes were clearly there--getting money to buy back his kingdom--the personal meaning of it for him felt weak and disconnected. I would rather have had a plot that relied on gut-level connection with the characters for the final fireworks, not merely surprise and cleverness. Though I will say, that after the biggest climax, Lawhead reconnects us to Bran's heart and struggles. 
 Back to the positives, Lawhead's note at the end of the book about his research was fascinating. I loved his look into the history of Robin Hood and the geography and history of the Welsh people. He builds a solid, real-life case for his Bran ap Brychan, and since I'm excited about anything resembling a historical mystery, I loved the way he pieced together the premise for his book. I highly recommended taking the time to read it. 
 I'm a huge fan of Paul Creswick's Robin Hood, so any Robin Hood retelling has a longstanding fandom to live up to. Stephen Lawhead's rendition made for a mostly fun summer romp on my TBR stack. Adventure, character growth, and a touch of Celtic legend of the very best variety make for good ingredients to work with."
5,I feel a little guilty giving this book 5 stars because this is kind of a guilty pleasure series but I cant help it. it was all action and cuteness!! what more could I possibly ask for?! I am just a puddle after finishing this x-(
3,"I had high expectations with this book. Those were definitely disappointed. Gwen's constant self-loathing and the constant placement of guilt on herself were tiring. When she mentioned that she felt guilty for her mother's death over and over again, I just thought. ""Yes, we get it"". The book was also more high-school drama than Fantasy, which was disappointing, because I really enjoyed the mythology parts. I also really liked Daphne and the ending made me want to read more because I think there's great potential there. I just hope the other books are better than the first one."
5,"Perhaps the most beautiful and the purest, most honest book I've ever read. I want to tear out the pages and frame them on my walls"
5,"Love. I was worried when I saw the 823 pages. I'm a pretty big beliver that books don't need to be over 400 or 500 pages. But this kept my interest the entire time! Which is really impressive. I'm not a huge fan of Winter and Jacin's story. They were my least favorite actually. But I still liked them. I liked all the characters which again is surprising for myself. With dystopians I often feel they are a bunch of teenagers trying to play hero, but I didn't here. They took their time and planned and were smart about it. I also don't like when the climax of a series is one chapter and then its over. This fight scene kept going for several chapters and with each one my emotions kept going all over. (My favorite part of reading!) And the after part wasn't over too quickly either. I love LOVE a good fairytale retelling and this is a great one."
5,"Grapes of Wrath, China style."
2,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this just Moran's How to Be a Woman slightly (barely) rewritten? More autobiographical than fiction, it leads to a repetitive and limited main character and unremarkable (maybe, again, because I've already heard it) story of growth and development. Moran's bare honesty peeks out from this otherwise endless self-essay with its barest mask of fiction, and her humor survives the exhausting life-advice rambles, but this book is overall a disappointment."
5,I don't know what to say other than I AM SOBBING EVERYWHERE. This book was heartbreakingly perfect. I can't wait to see how it all plays out!
4,Two and a half years of waiting...it better be good!
3,"I pick up Stephanie Plum books expecting a few laughs, some Ranger, some Morelli and a car explosion. 
 I'll be honest, even the car explosion was a bit disappointing in this one. So was the sexual tension between Stephanie and the guys. Probably because there wasn't so much sexual tension as just random sex. 
 Even Lula and Grandma Mazur were a bit of a shadow of their usual selves."
4,"Twelve year old Meggie lives with her father, Mo, a bookbinder. Books have always been a huge part of her life; treasures that will share their stories and secrets with anyone will to take the time to read them. But Meggie had to teach herself to read as her father has never read aloud to her and swears he never will. 
 Meggie has never thought this to be unusual, until a strange man named Dustfinger comes to their door, wanting to know about a particular book. A book that Mo has never mentioned to Meggie or let her see. Soon, they have packed their bags and are on their way to stay with Eleanor, a relative of Meggie's mother. There, things get more complicated and soon Mo and the book, Inkheart, have been kidnapped. Meggie and Eleanor, with Dustfinger accompanying them, set out to find Mo and learn his secret and that of the book. 
 I debated whether or not to give up the secret of Inheart in this review. I know it has been done in some reviews and even on some of the book blurbs. It's brilliant, clever and wonderfully executed and I decided to leave it to the reader to decide if he or she wants to know in advance, or to discover the truth slowly as Meggie does. 
 Inkheart is technically a children's book, but it is as much a delight for adults as their children. I hope I'll get a chance to read it to my son one day as I also don't see this as a book that is going to date badly. It is a little slow to get going - I had to work on the first third or so - which is where it lost a point. But once the pace picks up, things roar along as we work out what is going on and our heroes all supply parts of the solution. 
 I have recently heard that there is a sequel in the works - I had wondered as I finished as some characters were left without their story completed - and I will be looking forward to reading it.

3,"I was given a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. To read more reviews like this one, check out Obsessive Book Nerd! 
 3.5 Stars (Goodreads, give us the half star...PLEASE!) 
 You can tell by the synopsis of One Day Soon, that this book wasn't going to be a light read. And it wasn't. Everything about One Day Soon is hard, dark and difficult. The story of Imogene and Yoss is heartbreaking. 
 The story is wonderfully written. Beautiful even. These two people meet during the lowest points in their lives and they fall in love. Falling in love is magical and wonderful but there were so many limitations to Yoss and Imi's love it was painful to read about. This story is a story about a second chance at love, but what happens if that second chance doesn't have a happy ending either? What if it does? 
 I loved both Imi and Yoss as characters. They were well developed with the right about of positive and negative qualities and growth. Chapters alternated between present day and fifteen years in the past. Because of this the pacing was a tad slow at times. However, the plot was very unique and is probably quite common. 
 I couldn't put this book down once I hit the 40% mark. It was a stay up until 2 a.m. to finish it kind of book. The only reason, I can't give this book a another star is because it literately broke my heart into a thousand pieces the entire length of the book. This last star is my happiness star...and I just can't give it up to this book."
4,"There's some terrible things talked about in this book, but god help me, I couldn't help but laugh. 
 Survivor is the story of Tender Branson, who, when we first meet him, is on an airplane minus passengers and pilot, the former having been deplaned shortly after takeoff and the latter having parachuted after giving tips to Branson about how to keep the plane in the air after the pilot jumps, the amount of time before all four engines flame out, etc. Branson is the sole occupant of the plane, and is now telling his true life story to the airplane's black box which will survive the inevitable plane crash. He wants to get it clear right away that he is no murderer; getting from the beginning to the end when he finally reveals the reasons behind clearing his name is the journey the reader makes through the novel. 
 And what a story it is. Prior to sitting in the cockpit, Branson's adult life was one as a ""full-time drudge,"" and part-time god."" His day job was slaving away at housecleaning for wealthy employers, guided by a day planner, so that at any given hour of his workday, he and his employers know what he's doing. He's interrupted periodically by calls from his boss, who asks him questions about such topics as how to eat lobster correctly at an upcoming dinner, which forks to use, that sort of thing. Tender Branson is a whiz at home economics; he spent his life being schooled in running the perfect home. He is also, as we discover shortly after meeting him, a member of the federal Survivor Retention Program, which affords him a caseworker with whom he meets each week, a tiny apartment with a shared hallway bathroom, free government cheese and a bus pass. Branson grew up in the Nebraska church district colony of the Creedish; at age 17 he was baptized and sent out as a labor missionary. This was the common practice of the Creedish; all boys but the first-born sons (all named Adam) went out into the world to work and shared the name of Tender. The girls who were not chosen as wives for the first-born sons went out to work as well, sharing the name of Biddy. Back home, the Adams and their wives had children, children and more children, and the children spent their lives learning a particular trade. There were rules for living on the outside, though -- no dancing, no listening to broadcast media, and the biggest one of all was this one: 
 ""If the members of the church district colony felt summoned by God, rejoice. When the apocalypse was imminent, celebrate, and all Creedish must deliver themselves unto God, amen."" 
 While Tender Branson is cleaning grout and getting bloodstains out of leather, the word comes that the Creedish in Nebraska have been delivered; he is taken into the Survival Retention program so that he doesn't off himself. There are rashes of suicides among the survivors, and at some point, Tender becomes the only surviving member of the cult (well, as far as the authorities know), and thanks to a savvy agent whose job it is to make cult suicide look ""fresh and exciting every time around,"" is turned into a new messiah for the people. 
 As Tender's lifestory is recorded for posterity, the author takes potshots at different facets of American culture that blend into Tender's experience. For example, while being refitted as a ""new guru"" for people who need to ""make sense of their risk-free boredom of a lifestyle,"" he climbs the ""stairmaster to heaven,"" and is wardrobed, told what to say, and pumped full of botox, steroids, drugs etc in order to make him media perfect. As his agent tells him, 
 ""Nobody wants to worship you if you have the same problems, the same bad breath and messy hair and hangnails as a regular person."" 
 Sitting in the cockpit, Branson reflects that ""Reality means you live until you die...The real truth is nobody wants reality."" 
 There are also riffs on diagnosing yourself via the DSM with the disorders of the day, things people pray for here combined into his ""Book of Very Common Prayer,"" people being so busy with working and making money that they don't have time to enjoy their gardens, but one of the biggest ideas that comes out of this story is based on how to find salvation in the face of boredom that comes from sameness and having no control over your own life. 
 As I said earlier, it's not all funny, because there are some pretty tragic things described in here, but I defy anyone not to laugh while reading this book. Fantastic novel -- if you haven't read it, go and get yourself a copy soon. I love Chuck Palahniuk because he's such a great satirist, expressing questions about life in terms everyone can understand and recognize. Another one not to be missed."
4,"The world-building of Updraft deserves all the stars. It's wildly unlike anything I've ever heard of before, much less read--there are no touchstones with historical cultures or literary tropes. Even if I have my doubts as to how a society could survive for so long without, you know, the ground, there was a ton of thought put into all aspects of this world, and the details are lovely. However, this makes Updraft a very dense read. I literally got a headache while reading it, because there are so many complex details to keep straight. 
 And it takes a while for the book to get going. I struggled through Part One--I didn't find the characters or the conflicts super-compelling. But rest assured, from page one of Part Two, the story is riveting. And all that complicated world-building means that by the last third of the book, I was completely immersed in the world and the story. 
 The characters could be stronger. The ending felt abrupt--it could have used another chapter. And I am not okay with the way the littlemouth was used. But the world is so immersive and the conflicts so compelling that I nearly gave this book five stars."
3,"It's Beauty and the Beast! I can't help but read B&tB retellings even though they always disappoint me (Disney and Robin McKinley make all the other versions look bad). However, remembering not to get excited helped a lot. 
 This one was good. For one thing, it had a reason for existing and it actually had something new to do with the story rather than ""just"" retelling it. It was also clever: Hodge comes up with a very good backstory for all her characters and, while the world-building sometimes feels more like window-dressing, it's very good window-dressing and I rarely notice that the world doesn't quite seem...flesh-outable. 
 And Nyx (beauty) has a personality! And she's not a goody two shoes. Her inner demons were my favorite part of her, although (first novel problems) Hodge had a tendency to have Nyx tell us what she was feeling rather than letting Nyx feel it on the page. 
 Anyway, definitely worth reading in my never-ending quest to read all the reasonably enjoyable YA fairy tale retellings (except the urban fantasy ones because I'm pickier about UF). 
 --- 
 Thoughts on the reread - holy toxic family dynamics batman! 
 I feel like there's a whole thing to be written about Hodge and trauma/culpability/forgiveness (and I'm also getting bitten by the unexamined Christian attitudes towards forgiveness and guilt that her stories seem to have). 
 Also, pacing is very different in audiobook form than print. Funny how much more sense the ending made."
4,The only bad thing about these books is that they end.
3,"A close-to-the-future dystopian YA where children are sent to workhouses if their family goes ""over the limit"" --- that is, if they spend too much. Our protagonist, a math genius, is taken up and sent to a seemingly luxurious complex where he does mathematical modeling to help his family get back under the limit. But is everything what it seems? Nah. 
 The math content, except for a fun game of horse basketball at the beginning, is fairly sparse, with a stronger focus on vague hacking skills. The plot moves quickly, and I liked the lives of the Top Floorers --- those geniuses who can solve big problems to raise money at the workhouse. But I don't really see this as a good option for classroom use. 
 (view spoiler)[ A basic premise of the book involves our basic disgust of the idea of a workhouse. Granted, the initial impressions of the workhouse is quite nice (until we see the underbelly), but part of the shock of the book is seeing children forced to work. However, the plot isn't about changing the system --- it's about exposing the corruptness of this particular workhouse. At the end of the book, children still work to pay off the debts of their parents. I would have preferred an ending with much more social change. (hide spoiler)]"
5,I don't read much YA/NA but this book drew me in and held me close until the very end. I LOVED every single second of it! I can't wait to continue the series!
5,"With an overcrowded market full of cheap reads and cheaper storylines, young adult supernatural romances are often regarded with a wary eye. Maggie Stiefvater's Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy--and her Books of Faerie--are truly an exception to every rule. Her prose is literally delicious; I smell the scents she describes, see the world as if it were before my eyes. Perhaps her talent is one of the reasons why some don't like the books--Shiver, Linger, and now Forever are all quiet, thoughtful reads. You can't just skip through a sequence, and there aren't random filler action scenes. Even the romantic bits usually serve a purpose--for the individuals as well as the couple. Grace may look at Sam and kiss him, but she's also fearing for their future. 
 As a devotee of Shiver and Linger, I ventured into Forever with both excitement and fear. I've read all of Maggie's books; she isn't one to give her readers a happy ending just because they want it. Nor does she spare her own feelings by ending with melodramatic sweetness. Endings are always difficult in this manner; you, as the reader, want a good ending, but you also want that happily ever after. In the same light, I, as a writer, know that it is hard to tie up a story the way it should be without hurting a character, a character that has likely become similar to a child. The ending of a series is its most integral part. It makes or breaks the entire saga. Many hated the Twilight saga before the release of Breaking Dawn. Although I won't pretend that it was amazing or well-written, I did love the first three books for what they were; however, the sappy, traitorous ending left me unable to re-read the books ever again. Maggie Stiefvater averted this sort of literary injustice in every way. 
 We return to our four main characters and find them broken. Forever isn't an easy read--because yes, they are hurt, and no, they don't have a lot of nice, light moments. Isabel and Cole's relationship is still tormented, and has a long way to go before one can even call it such. Sam and Grace are separated, as is the reality of their world. Forever offers resolution, yet leaves a lot of unanswered questions. Why? Because that is realistic. Because that is the way Maggie's world unfolds. She stays true to herself and her characters on every single page, through every line of dialogue. Though it's the last book, she doesn't cut straight to the action; much of it is in fact spent on character development, despite the fact that a threat looms right around the corner. This might frustrate some readers. Yet, the greatest demons for Sam and Grace, Isabel and Cole are not the small-minded townspeople or Isabel's vicious father, but something from within. They are all damaged people, and Maggie isn't going to neglect that in lieu of more physical issues ahead. 
 Speaking of, the parents of this series are always hotly debated. Perhaps, I suspect, because their reality hits too close to home for many older readers. The only thing the four main characters have in common--besides their friendships--is the fact that all of them have lacking parental units. Even Cole, whose past is a bit murkier than others, is clearly tormented about his father. He frequently refers to him in Forever, and despite their animosity, idolizes him in a way that is both subtle and painfully obvious. Grace's neglectful parents make their reappearance, and one is actually a bit more fleshed out--yet we, and Grace, still can't forgive them. I didn't want her to, and Maggie doesn't cop out with a sentimental reunion. Isabel's father, Tom Culpeper, remains as villainous as ever--but we do see some of his motivation. I can't imagine the pain of losing a child. But I was also surprised by how much I felt for Isabel's mother, a literal desperate housewife trying to make her own life. As for Sam--Forever actually dips into an issue even deeper than that of his murderous biological parents. I suspect that what hurts Sam even more than those memories are the secrets surrounding his foster father, Beck. Sam and Beck's relationship had me crying throughout Forever. Though he remains shrouded in mystery, Beck catches many heartstrings; we both loathe and love him, just as Sam does. 
 Sam, Grace, Isabel, and Cole all want different things. Maggie does not let them get what they want without sacrifices, and even then their happiness is elusive. That, perhaps, is what I loved most about Forever--besides the amazing little details and the characters that feel as real as my friends. I saw exactly how much these people cared about each other. Because they were willing to give up everything--and then I saw that, despite their terrible family lives, they had crafted a new family, and little separate relationships aside from that. Forever is not simply about Sam and Grace or Isabel and Cole. It is about all of them, and was executed as such with amazing believability. Thanks to Forever, The Wolves of Mercy Falls will always hold a special place in my heart."
4,Emotionally devastating. Feels a bit like KJ Parker. Awesome.
5,"Maybe not quite as good as the first one for me, due to a couple of issues I had with it, but still (just) warrants 5 stars for me. 
 Fitz is a great character and I loved how real his world seems to me, and this is enough for me to mostly overlook the slight issues I have. 
 Looking forward to the final part."
2,"I wanted to like this book, but as the story unraveled I found it harder and harder to pick up. Based on the description I expected so much more. But with the way the story was presented - one chapter of past events, one chapter of recent events - and just an all around unlikely storyline I just wasn't a fan."
4,"Excellent wrap-up of the series, though I'm more than a little sad that there won't be more of Daniel and Elijah. I was so caught up in their relationship and their lives that I ended up staying awake all night and reading the whole trilogy in one shot. 
 As much as I loved it, though, I do have some criticisms of this final installment in the story. The pacing felt off toward the end, like Price had too much story and too little time to tell it. (view spoiler)[So much surrounding the various legal issues was handled ""off-screen"" as it were, that they didn't feel as urgent or involving as they should have, and Meredith felt like a deus ex machina. (hide spoiler)] I couldn't help but wonder if Price had plotted the whole series arc at the beginning, or if she'd done each book as she went along; there's a mild sense of discontinuity, of things being created and added later as the plot required them, that suggests the latter. 
 Still, those problems are, for me, all outweighed by the enjoyability of the whole."
5,"Well, I must say that I was blown away by this one. Having read through some other reviews, I do agree with some of the criticisms, more specifically issues with the pacing in certain spots as well as the redundant use of incredulous. This book is certainly not without it's flaws. However, back to the meat and potatoes here, this book starts off with a kick to the chest and finishes with a stranglehold leaving you gasping for breath. I spent an hour after finishing reliving the ending over and over, I will leave that for you to discover yourself. What is even more surprising to me, was that the journey along the way was as good if not better. Our hero, Robert Neville, spends a good deal of time trying to explain the rise of the vampires, and even breaks into a library to steal some textbooks as he desperately searches for answers to the phenomenon. This was a great touch, as every other vampire novel I've read forces you to accept them for what they have traditional been. Not Richard Matheson. 
 Overall, great story, albeit it is only 160 pages. Matheson won't spend paragraphs explaining the lighting in a room, so get ready for in-your-face writing. I would have given 4 stars, but the vampire epidemiology was superb and left me no choice but the 5. A true must read. 
 My edition also came with a half dozen short stories. I really enjoyed Buried Talents, Witch War, and From Shadowed Places. All of which left me with a devious grin on my face. To note here, half of these short stories are also re-published in The Nightmare at 20,000 Feet, so be aware."

 https://amateurpoetbooknerd.wordpress... 
 I really enjoyed this book! It originally took me awhile to finish it because the beginning kind of dragged but once the main characters all clashed, the plot took better form. 
 You can only appreciate the cover of the book once you finish the book. I can pinpoint Raithe with the sword, Malcolm with the spear, Persephone in her widow-black garb, the amazingly quirky Suri, and the wise wolf Minna. 
 What I liked: 
 I loved all of the main characters-they had their own flaws, they were relatable, and were constructed masterfully. 
 Raithe: 
 This is not a fantasy novel that takes an eon to describe the world with great, drawling detail before beginning the story- we are immediately introduced to Raithe and are the audience to the horror as his father his slain before him. I liked Raithe a lot. There are times where I cannot relate to a male character or I want to roll my eyes at his machismo but Raithe is a reluctant hero-he does not want to be the ""God-Killer"" nor does he want to kill needlessly, Raithe just wants a normal life, a woman to share his life with, and a thriving family. Raithe is amazing in that aspect but other than that, he kind of falls behind as the plot thickens. His skills are necessary but as the story proves, you need more than brute strength to survive. When I read the originally synopsis, I thought the story was going to be all about Raithe and his exploits but I am happier that it unfolded this way. 
 Persphone: 
 LOVED HER! I think author's are following in George R. R. martin's footsteps and constructing such strong, amazing, dependable, dynamic, just UGH non-damsel-in-distress female characters who prove that women can and will do it better! All the female characters secondary and main are amazingly strong-from sassy Moya, Brin, Sarah, and of course Padera! Through Persephone's eyes, we are able to watch her fight to be heard as she loses power when her husband, the chieftain is slain by a bear. She does not quiet-she proves to be an awesome force that outsmarts the new chieftain. When her people turn on her, she does not back down ; she listens to Suri the mystic's warning and is able to utilize Raithe's strength. I am excited to see how with her as the new chieftain how she will prepare for the future battles. Also, though I LOVE a good romance, I was happy that Persephone did accept Rathe's affection but did not pursue it-the second book better be steamy though Sullivan! haha 
 AND-I love how Sullivan named her Persephone haha! In reference to the Greek Gods, Persephone is depicted as the damsel Kore before taken by Hades but this Persephone stands up to her enemies! 
 Suri: 
 LOVED HER! She is just this bundle of wild, quirky energy! As a mystic, she warns Persephone of the upcoming calamities and she introduces us to a new way of thinking. At certain points, I was laughing at how cut-and-dry she was! Unused to being around humans or Rhunes, she does not understand their customs and despite being covered in dirt and hanging around with a wolf, she thinks them backwards! Sullivan must have a blast constructing Suri-she is a delight. As she becomes stationed in the dhal I wonder about her roll in the future novels. 
 What I did not like: 
 I liked the book but there were times where I was just so confused with the different terms and races.These forgiven words are being thrown around and it was hard for me to follow. Overall, that is pretty much it! I will definitely be prepared for the next book! 
 4 stars! An amazingly fun summer read! The next four books are probably going to be awesome-can't wait to read them!"
3,"Okay so at first glance, for some reason I totally thought this was one of those books for teenage girls about 'finding themselves' in the cold, cruel world. hahaha Silly me. Yes, I didn't even realize this is the girl from The Office. 
 This was a cute, quick, funny, and quite enjoyable read."
4,"Is historical fantasy the proper name for this genre? I loved the setting, I loved the rules of the magic, and I loved the characters. This is a high recommend for teens."
5,"A Two-cent Review from http://jaemoranwrites.blogspot.com/ 
 I flat out loved this book. It's a sad reminder of the past and how far we've come since the early eighties. We sometimes forget how much has changed for the GLBT community in thirty years. The Return shows that beautifully. About 2/3rds of the way thru the book, I cried, sobbed really, for an entire chapter. The writing is stellar and the characters are complete and consistent throughout. The Return had a full sense of place, Austin felt different than NYC or Fire Island. I could say a lot about why I loved it and where I think the flaws are. I'm a Virgo I can pick apart anything, but that's not to say that The Return is anything less than sublime. 
 My quibbles are minor. First, the connections between the present and the past are a little heavy handed at times and there are too many for the reader to have any doubts about what's going on. It would have worked better, for me, if the answer could have been more elusive. The scene at the very end felt a little too concrete. The concept of reincarnation is too unknowable to be framed as fact. It would have been fun to argue with my friends about what I believe and what I think was happening in the book, but The Return doesn't allow much room for that which is kind of weird considering the ongoing debates about music that hold the frame of the book together. 
 And the music... In some ways, the integration of the music into the book is what made the book for me. I read a lot. A lot. It's not unusual for me to love a book, but even when I find a book I adore and will re-read over and over again, it doesn't usually change the way I think about things or affect the quality of my life outside the four walls of my kindle. The Return did that in a way I will always be grateful for. My relationship with music has been forever changed... or maybe renewed is a better word. 
 For most of my life listening to music was a passion. As much as I wanted to be a musician, it just wasn't in the cards for me so I was left with listening. I listened with my whole heart. I cared about what the singer/songwriter/musician was trying to tell me. For many years, when I couldn't sleep, I would take the quilt off the bed, curl up on a chair in the corner of the living room, plug the ""good headphones"" into the stereo and manually turn the dial to surf the radio looking for music that interested me. For hours, I would tune out the rest of my life and just listen. It was my way of connecting myself to something greater, the collective consciousness or God, if that makes you more comfortable. In that private cocoon I could listen to whatever moved me. I wasn't bound by expectations or the ridicule of my friends or my own preconceived notions of what I should be listening to as a teen and young adult. I discovered music and genres that were outside my little bubble in suburban Boston. From Folk and Reggae to Classic Rock and Opera, I found music that stirred my soul in a way that was otherwise inaccessible to me. Those were the times when music became transformative for me. 
 It took a while, but one day I grew up. I was an adult with a mortgage and a stressful job. Over that period, music dropped off my radar. It became background noise to the rest of my life. I still listened to it all the time. There is rarely an hour that goes by that I don't have my iPod in the dock or Pandora playing as I write or read or work or clean or whatever. I sang along and listened superficially but I stopped taking the time to listen as a primary activity. I lost the visceral connection to music that had so sustained me back in the day. The Return reminded me how important that connection was and how much I had missed it when it just wasn't a priority. 
 Brad Boney gave me the great gift of returning music to my soul. I won't forget that lesson again and if I do, I am sure to read The Return again and again and it will remind me what I almost lost forever. 
 Listen to the YouTube Playlist, that goes along with The Return... http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=... 
 If you love pop/rock music and haven't heard Bruce Springsteen's keynote at the 2012 SXSW, you missed something amazing. It is well worth the hour of your time. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvaRKl..."
4,"Glad to get all that background story sorted out. I feel bad for Mina though, being the incarnation of the goddess of love but will never find love herself. I've always wondered why the other sailors didn't get their own soul mates. That's a bit sad. Loved the last few moments of this and the twist reveal of who Ace was... didn't see that coming."
5,"This book is just BEAUTIFUL! A wordless story, told in some of the most beautiful illustrations I have seen in a while. This is a story of the power of imagination. 
 Lovely."
2,"This novel isn't told in a standard way. It is composed of police records, interviews, video transcripts, and diary entries. I felt that this was unique and it kept my attention much longer than a standard third person chronological novel would. 
 I really liked the beginning portion where the reader is trying to put together the pieces for themselves. It was mildly unnerving (but that could just be because I read it in a thunderstorm with the lights flickering.) I also thought the ending reveal was something I wasn't expecting and I appreciated the direction that the story went. 
 Some of the found footage aspects towards the middle and end felt a little forced, as did much of the teenage dialogue and emotional ranges. The middle pacing was bogged down, and I felt it was descending into horror tropes with standard ""crazy"" mc, stupid teenagers, and a ouija board (though not technically). The ending provided much more originality and I appreciated that. 
 I could see how someone a little younger than me with less of a horror threshold might really like this."
4,"Someone else said this book was Hunger Games for boys. Pretty much sums it up. Even bleaker than Hunger Games, though. I'll definitely read the next in the series."
4,"I read this so fast -- curled up with the last four books in the series, read them all in a week -- and I really didn't stop to enjoy it, just get to the end as fast as I can to find out if Harry lives or not. Definitely going to go back and read it again more slowly."
3,"As a huge fan of James Dasner's THE MAZE RUNNER, I was eagerly anticipating his latest series, which goes back to the days of Gibson and cyberpunk. 
 THE EYE OF MINDS is the first book in this new series, called The Mortality Doctrine, and it features a male main character, Michael, who, with his friends, spends a lot of time in a virtual reality network based on gaming. Via things called ""Coffins,"" games can immerse themselves in a game, with their sensory perception completely experiencing everything from the game. 
 Michael soon discovers a gamer who's altering the games, and through a series of events, is coerced into helping the government agency responsible for policing this online world to find this gamer for them. 
 For teens too young to have seen THE MATRIX, there may be a mystery here to solve along with Michael. For those who've already seen both THE MATRIX and the SPY KIDS franchise, however, you'll see the big twist coming from miles away, leaving not much here to be surprised at. 
 It's still a good book, and I'll be looking for the next one in the series, but after the originality and tension of THE MAZE RUNNER, THE EYE OF MINDS felt like a let-down."
5,"This book was absolutely sensational. I could not put it down. I read it within 24 hours. 
 The opening of the book was a little confusing as things were not explained, but in the end everything was explained. Some of the writing did not flow as well, especially in the beginning. 
 I really enjoyed the main character Laila and her introduction into the circus. The evolving of the relationships Laila made were fun to follow and I felt that I really got to know who she was. I really enjoyed the inner workings of the circus and what went on, especially since it was placed in the early 1900's. I have read many books by first time authors and this book surpassed them all. Chloe Kayne is an excellent writer and the book surpassed my expectations. Absolutely LOVED the book and cannot wait for the story or Laila to continue with the Marvelle Circus!!"
4,"D U D E. This was wicked cool. I wish that I had more time this week to read and gobble it up faster. Next one, please! 
 A note: the first 30 or so pages are rough to get through. There is a ton of info dumping and slang that I didn't understand but the glossary provided is full of spoiler-y type things (so really, only viable after you read the book or slightly halfway through.) But if you can muster through those first bits, the rest of the book is totally worth the initial frustration and confusion."
3,"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is one of my guilty pleasure authors. I have always loved Sherlock Holmes. Growing up I watched the black and white short movies starring Basil Rathbone. When the newer film came out with Robert Downy Jr. I celebrated the event by purchasing the massive hardcover collection from Barnes and Noble the very same day I saw the movie. 
 This novella opens with the feature character shooting up drugs. Oh yeah, Holmes is a huge drug addict. Apparently his life is so terribly boring when he doesn't have a case that he needs to get high to get through the day. For those of you unfamiliar with the Holmes books, they're told through the point of view of Sherlock's roommate, Dr. Watson, who you come to find is probably the only living human being who can stand to live with the man. 
 The problem with Holmes is that it's difficult to write a lengthy review on one of his novellas. They're pretty self-explanatory, and I don't know what else to say aside from telling you all to read it. The writing is wonderful, the characters are memorable, and the plot stands up to Doyle's reputation. 
 I'll have you know that I much rather preferred this novella as compared to the Holmes work done before hand, A Study in Scarlet. If you are going to read any of these works, which I hope you do, I suggest starting with this one. I haven't had the pleasure of reading all of his pieces, but I know from those I have read, this is my favorite so far. I think you get a better appreciation for the characters and it's a better representation for the rest of the works. 
 Holmes, if you've ever seen any of the films based on him, is a very fun character, the novellas are short enough to plow through in an afternoon, and the stories are exciting. All I can say is that there are no excuses for giving these books a try. It's just enough to read between your books that are as thick as bricks, and really, who doesn't love Sherlock Holmes?"
5,"This is either the happiest sad book I've ever read, or the saddest happy book. Either way, it brought me to tears while making me laugh... and either way, I simply loved it. 
 In One Plus One, we meet single mom Jess Thomas, in her late twenties, working as many jobs as possible to support her two kids, and just not getting by. The bills are stacking up, and there are always more. Plus, stepson Nicky is getting bullied and beaten up and daughter Tanzie is a math genius who should be in private school -- but private school is simply out of reach financially. 
 There were lots of awful things about the father of your children leaving: the money issues, the suppressed anger on behalf of your children, the way most of your coupled-up friends now treated you as if you were some kind of potential husband stealer. But worse than that, worse than the endless, bloody exhausting financial and energy-sapping struggle, was that being a parent on your own when you were totally out of your depth was actually the loneliest place on earth. 
 And then there's Ed Nicholls, software success story with oodles of money who makes a seriously bad decision while breaking up with a crush from his college days and ends up embroiled in an insider trading investigation that could cost him everything. 
 Worlds collide. Jess cleans Ed's house and has never been more than the unseen cleaner to him -- but when his world starts falling apart, he happens to come across Jess and her kids stranded on the side of the road, and in a burst of do-gooder repentance, decides to offer to drive them to Scotland for a math Olympiad competition that may provide Tanzie with the funds to get to the school she needs. 
 And thus ensues one of the funniest, most uncomfortable, and unluckiest road trips in literary road trip history. Car sickness, food poisoning, big drooly dogs, and cows in the road all play a part in Ed and Jess's big adventure. Yet along the way, some miraculous things occur. Jess has time with her kids, for the first time in years, in which she has nothing else to do and nowhere else to be. Nicky starts to smile again. Tanzie has a shot at the maths future she so craves. And Ed and Jess go from prickly antagonism to spiky friendship to maybe something more. 
 Jess is a ridiculously optimistic person who just doesn't give up, even when her kids are falling apart and she's down to her last few pounds. She believes that things will get better. She believes that good people eventually wind up getting the good fortune they deserve. 
 She wondered whether being able to sound cheerful about things that made her want to kick something was her superpower. 
 But when one thing after another goes wrong and she sees her children getting a raw deal -- again -- even Jess's unfailingly sunny outlook starts to wear thin. Ed certainly knows better. He knows that bad stuff happens, like it or not, and that momentary weakness can lead to ruin. The question is, can he and Jess somehow change their fates and find a way toward happier times? 
 As Tanzie muses: 
 The law of probability combined with the law of large numbers states that to beat the odds, sometimes you have to repeat an event an increasing number of times in order to get you to the outcome you desire. The more you do, the closer you get. Or, as I explain it to Mum, basically, sometimes you just have to keep going. 
 The chemistry between Ed and Jess is delightful, going from silent dislike to grudging acceptance to a reluctant attraction and then some. These two smart, lonely, often disappointed people manage to forge a connection during their few short days stuffed in a car together, and between their hurt and their sense of humor, a spark starts to catch: 
 Mr. Nicholls nodded toward the candle and the plates. And then he looked up at Jess and he was no longer scowling. ""This is actually the best pie and chips I've ever eaten in a weird bed-and-breakfast somewhere I've never heard of on the north Yorkshire moors."" 
 One Plus One moves effortlessly between points-of-view, so that we hear from Jess, Ed, Nicky, and Tanzie. Each has a unique and compelling voice; each voices his or her slightly different take on matters without feeling forced or artificial. The author skillfully weaves together these characters into one cohesive whole. There's momentum and there's real emotion. While many of the escapades along the way are kind of goofy, underlying it all is a story of good people caught up in situations in which it feels like the whole world is against them. How do you stay good when you can never catch a break? When no matter what, things don't work out? 
 There aren't easy answers here for any of the characters, but somehow, by putting them all together, one plus one does add up to so much more than it should. The group dynamics are fabulous, and each character in this lovely novel feels like a real person. The reader can't help but feel invested in them, individually and as a part of their interwoven relationships. 
 I've read one book by Jojo Moyes previously, her historical novel The Girl You Left Behind (reviewed here last September). I may be the last person on the planet who hasn't read the author's bestseller Me Before You, and I plan to remedy that as soon as possible. Jojo Moyes is absolutely gifted at writing that gets to the heart and soul of her characters, bringing them to life in a way that lets readers feel as though they're meeting real people, not fictional creations. One Plus One is a contemporary novel that conveys warmth and connection through characters who are sympathetic and likeable. You want Jess and Ed to succeed, and you want Nicky and Tanzie to be happy. Not every novel can make you care quite so much. One Plus One is a quiet book in many ways, but one that I recommend wholeheartedly.

4,"This is a really sweet and funny story. Sofia is a very likeable character, and Malik has a great comedic voice; although the comparison to Bridget Jones's Diary has been made many times already, it's definitely appropriate. At times I did find the whole 'Muslim dating book from the POV of a character writing a Muslim dating book' a bit too meta, but that's my only complaint. On the whole I'd say this is definitely worth a read, I personally didn't really know anything about the world of dating in Muslim culture before this book, so I found it really interesting."
4,"I was a bit confused before reading this book. I mean, on Goodreads the review rating was 4.16/5, which is really good! Yet in the comments and written review portion, most of them were ranging from 1-2 stars. You could see my dilemma, whether to read the book or not? Boy was I glad I did. Guys. I can't stress enough about how if you want to read the book, like the concept of the book and even love the cover of the book, don't listen to the reviews that'll put you off. You can never know how you'll like a book by just reading reviews, you have to actually read it yourself. And that's exactly what I did. 
 This was The Bachelor meets The Hunger Games. Yes, the names were ridiculous but besides that, I actually liked America's journey to find herself and to find true love that might not be Aspen. The Caste System was pretty interesting to me, how the amount of money you had would class your family by a number. So America was a 6, therefore her and her families last name was Cohen. Now, her family moved up to a 5, in which her last name has now changed to Singer. SO WEIRD, cool but weird. The fact your last name changes with your class. It was pretty cool to see how controversial the caste system was/is. It actually plays a huge role in the later books as America and plenty of other defiant citizens wish it gone, once and for all. Of course The king isn't too happy about that and it causes America some trouble. 
 Prince Maxon was everything you can expect from a prince who played in riches. Nice enough, handsome, ignorant towards the poor, oh yeah and sorting through 35 girls like a game to find his wife. Guys, I KNOW it sounds so foolish and dumb but once you get into the book, it's pretty hard to put down. Cass just sucks you in with all of this detailed information about the world and the history of how it's come to this way of monarchy. Among all of the hate and dislike toward this series, there are people, like me, who actually enjoyed this book and the others to come. Read it if YOU want to read it and judge it by your own personal experience, not by others.

5,"This book has such an interesting, intriguing concept on the whole angels and demons theme. As usual, David stepped completely out of the box with his original vision of the angel stories. I, for one, did not see the twists and turns coming... I love being pleasantly surprised and was not disappointed! 
 And again, you can't help but fall in love with the characters he creates. I can't help but think about them in the back of my mind while working, eager to finish my work day so I can jump back into David's world! I'm so happy to have all the books in The Evolution Trilogy so I can continue right away, not having to wait for the next book to be finished. 
 And with that, my adventure continues as I delve into Demon Evolution 
 P.S. I really love the covers of this trilogy! :-)"
5,"If you loved the previous books in the series, you will not be disappointed! To be honest, I think this novel had a better ending than Royal wedding. (view spoiler)[(Spoiler for BOTH Royal Wedding and Remembrance!!! So, both the mediator-series and The princess' diaries ends with a wedding, but in my opinion the ending in Remembrance felt a lot more realistic. I got a bit annoyed at the fact that Mia found out she was pregnant with twins, because I think it was too late for her to have an abortion if she'd wanted to. And the fact that Mia's mum and her dad finally got together again seemed a bit far-fetched. I enjoyed the wedding in Remembrance because it was a pretty small wedding and it was never a huge deal (though obviously, Suze isn't a princess, so her wedding didn't have to be a big deal). (hide spoiler)] 
 A thing that slightly bothered me was that I realized the only time I read about relationships where the girl wants to have sex and the guy doesn't, it has to be because the guy wants to be a gentleman (for example, he wants to wait until the wedding night) and never because he isn't ready to have sex. 
 Another thing that bother me a lot was Suze's comments about Becca's apperance. Like when Becca has self-harmed and Suze says: ""And don't try to tell me that you did this because you hate the way you look. You're a smart girl, and smart girls know how to change their look if they're unhappy with it. You obviously don't want to. So what's really going on?"". Like WTF SUZE?! Firstly, not everyone can afford plastic surgery and expensive make up-products or clothes (especially they're a teenager). And secondly, changing your appearance doesn't necessarily change the way you feel about yourself. Confidence come from within. And why the f- are you implying that Becca doesn't want to change her appearance, wth do you know about that? Maybe she doesn't wear make up and style her hair, but that doesn't mean she isn't unhappy with something that she can't change with beauty products?! 
 Suze should be telling her that beauty standards are bullshit, and not imply that there's something wrong with her appearance. I know main characters don't have to be perfect, but since Suze actually wants to help people (both living and dead) and aspires to be a counselor she shouldn't act like that?!"
3,Lies is the third book in the Gone series and the point where I started to lose a little interest in the story or maybe just tired myself out temporarily from reading them in such a quick succession. This one's set some 7 months after all of the adults disappeared and goes even further into the supernatural side of things than Hunger did. New characters are introduced and people start to come back from the dead; it's definitely more horror filled than the previous two books which gives it a different angle to work from but some of the new storylines are a little dull and not as engaging. I'll probably read the rest of the Gone series later this year as I feel like I need to take a mini break from it for now!
4,"Henry and Kate were childhood friends. On Valentine's Day, Henry made Kate a card and kissed her. Soon after that Henry moved and Kate never heard back from him again. Now years later, Henry is back. Kate and Henry are both seniors in high school. A lot has changed since that first kiss. Kate is not a happy little girl anymore. She is sad and hides from everyone. The kids at school torment her and when she goes home - there is not peace there either. Everyday is about survival for Kate. Henry tries to reconnect with Kate, but Kate does not trust anyone. Henry does not know what happened. 
 This is a sad but beautiful story. Heartbreaking and heartwarming. 
 This was not an easy read. The parts where there was abuse was difficult for me to read. There were some pages I found myself skimming. 
 I loved that the first and last chapter were in Henry's POV. Even though there was an epilogue, I would love for there to be a sequel. 
 Henry was just everything. I loved Henry and I loved his family. 
 It reminded me of another story I read awhile ago UNLOVABLE."
3,"Well, that was an uncomfortable experience. I am not sure I have ever read a book while saying, ""Nope . . . un-uh . . . OMG NO!"" every single page. This is not me saying that it was bad, just that every action, every suggestion, every idea presented made me squirm. 
 This book is less story and more about social media and technology taking over our lives. The characters in the book are brainwashed lemmings who are led to believe that giving up their privacy is the most important thing in the world. Every breath must be tracked. Every opinion must be tabulated. Big Brother anyone? 
 I thought the concept of the book was interesting, but I am not sure the delivery was all that great. The main character's actions were very unbelievable and her progression through the course of the story, far fetched. The overall ""story"" was more about presenting little anecdotes of where we could be headed as a society than presenting a cohesive and moving narrative. If it was presented better, I may have left with this book in my memory as a cautionary tale I must heed. Instead, I am just kind of, ""Meh, some food for though, but my brain is still hungry"" 
 The book is worth checking out, especially if you have an interest in cyber-thrillers or how social media is taking over our world. But, don't go in expecting to be blown away by the writing."
5,"This is one of the first books I remember owning. I read it so often that the edges and spine were worn out. After all these years, I still love the stories and characters in this children's book. Seeing it on stage reminded me of how wonderfully put together these stories are for children and grown-ups alike!"
5,"I loved this. The only thing I've read of Charlie's before was ""Mending Noel"", which I liked. But this is the start of what I'm sure will be a very successful new series. There was a lot of effort put into setting up this universe and this great cast of characters. I'm already looking forward to what I hope will be Ash and Cael's story. But in this book, Dex and Sloane were great together. I loved Dex's crazy sense of humor. 
 The book really kept me entertained and I was impressed by the writing, particularly the excellen t dialogue. Highly recommended."
4,Incredible. What a feel-good book! And the swoon.. ;)
5,"!!!!!!!! Let's just start with how amazing her writing is. I loved every part of it. We're finally a book where the male that was not abused sexually or physically. Loved it. I loved the characters, the flaws and everything else. This is one of the best adult fiction I've ever read. Not that I've read a lot, but this is good. But I wouldn't say this is an adult fiction since there was only 25% of sex maybe? Or less. It is more of about feelings. 
 Yes, this book made me cry. Joss' pass was unbearable. It is heart moving and emotional. How she tells herself that she didn't love anyone so she could not feel anything when something happen to someone she loves. How much pain does a person has to go through to get to that stage? The therapist was amazing, actually. I am actually kinda disappointed that there wasn't much stories about her. 
 The friendship between Joss and Elise, I think everybody adored and envied their relationship. 
 Really, I think this is one of the best adult fiction of all time. The drama, the love scenes, the romance, everything was fitted right in. There wasn't too much drama nor sex to irritate people. Very well done. Glad I finally picked that up and read. 
 Challenge completed: A popular author's first book"
4,"To be very honest I liked it, but there where parts that I rather not read about. 
 So I didn't love it. This was my least favorite of this series too just because of particular scenes. 
 But on the other side now I understand everything a bit better too. 
 But like the great author she is she makes you forget the things you dislike. So I enjoyed it and now I'm really looking forward to Quinn and Lucas their story but also Dylan her story. I must admit my heart hurts for Hunter. I don't know what's gonna happen, but knowing Penelope it's going to be fantastic! 
 This book is basically about Kat and Jason ( Quin her parents, Jared his mom, Madocs father. ). How they met and how their lives were. Told in pov from Quinn it's in flashback's. Maybe that's good to know before you go in. Because I got in and than I was confused but then my brain started to go with me, and I figured it out. I can be smart like that. ;) 
 I enjoyed this one, I didn't love it for some reasons, but this one told me just exactly how and why I fell in love with Penelope Douglas her writing. She always manages to pull you in and makes you exited to continue and don't want to stop until it's out. 
 She truly is my favorite author! If she would make a manual I would read it ( and I normally don't read it, I always start to make, build and fix things without a manual. )"
5,"Wow. I cannot believe that this was a debut novel. For such a short book, this one sure packs a punch. I wasn't sure at first what to think about it. As I got further and further into the story and the lives of these characters got more and more messy, it was difficult to even keep reading. But I did, and I don't regret it for a second. 
 The story takes place primarily in the late 70s, although there are flashbacks and entire chapters that take place as far back as the 1950s. It follows the story of the Lee family, and coping with the death of one of their three children. (This is not a spoiler...it's in the synopsis. The first sentence of the book is: 'Lydia is dead.') 
 This is a story about love, equality, regret, and forgiveness. The parents are really difficult to connect with. Lydia was their favorite child, and it wasn't a secret to anyone in the family. Their relationship with their other two kids was disinterested at best, and neglectful at worst. There is so much dysfunction within the dynamics of this family that it was truly difficult to read, especially as characters continued to make the same terrible choices over and over again. But at the end of the day, it felt authentic. 
 I also liked the discussion of race in this book. The author is of Chinese descent, and I don't feel like we have many stories with Asian-American protagonists, especially not in that point in time. 
 If I had to find something to critique, it would be that I was occasionally confused in the structure. There are several characters in this book, and it is told in 3rd person. I don't have a problem with this most of the time, but there were occasions where one paragraph would switch between several of the characters POVs. Also, there were countless flashbacks to different events and conversations, and at times I would be unsure of what point in time I was reading about. Again, this is a relatively nitpicky thing, but I did want to mention it. 
 This story is at times heartbreaking, at other times infuriating. But I really ended up appreciating it, especially as a mom. I do think that it is an important book to read for any parent. Of course, as a parent we want the absolute best for our kids, but at what point does it become overwhelming? 
 I will definitely pick up more from Celeste Ng in the future."
4,"I really enjoyed this book, so much that I read it all in one sitting because I couldn't bear to put it down. After finishing the Glass series by this author I had high hopes for this story and I wasn't disappointed. Except for the fact that I didn't wait for the whole series before starting to read and now I need to wait for the next one to be out. All the same, this was a really good, quick read--for all that it seemed like it would be longer, the time flew by."
3,"This book felt more like a placeholder than anything else. My least favorite part of the series is Allie's on-going Daddy issues, and boy-howdy do you get a lot of that in MAGIC AT THE GATE. I enjoyed the interactions with Shame, Stone, and Allie taking care of un-responsive Zayvion, but I hated the endless back and forth bickering between Allie and her Dad. For every hint of interesting backstory, there was three times as much anger and borderline TSTL, give-no-quarter pettiness on Allie's part. Yeah, I get it, you hate having your Dad in there, and legitimately, it's a huge violation. Perhaps you should focus on wresting control from him and exorcising him from your body some time *other* than when you're in the land of Death or in a fight with a magical being that's kicking your ass. Just saying. 
 Read my full review at All Things Urban Fantasy."
3,"The book is fun. Actually it's a little strange to call a book fun that involves a sadistic SoB who is protagonist, and the worst part I actually found my self liking him - which scared me for a momemt. 
 But the book itself as I said was not more than fun and the thing that disturbed me the the most is the uncertainty of his Jorg's (The little sadist) actions, because the author did not explained his plans (which I think he should have done - 'cause it's told from first person and Jorg suppose to know what he wants to do before he actually does it). 
 The second thing that botherd me is uncertainty about the genre of a book. It's not a fantasy world 'cause it mentions alot of names and nations that have exsisted, it's not urban fantasy because it's not happenig in our world, and it's not dystopia 'case it's has magic and creatures that does not exsist in our world - thus it can't be our world that had been destroyed - so for me it's unknown genre. 
 Other than that I did not felt any amotions as I read the book and I mean by that, that I had no thrill in ""supposed to be thilled moments"", I slightly chuckled in ""supposed to be funny moments"", but in the end of the book' I felt that I want to read more - thus I gave it a hard 3 stars, otherwise it was 2 - 2,5. 
 All in all the book was entertaining, but I think poorly written. 
 Pitty thst I had anticipated alot more than I've received."
2,"Confessions of a Gullible Reader: I totally got sucked into this book... I don't know, I wasn't around during the 60s and 70s - things were much more dramatic then. There was Russia. The Berlin Wall. Vietnam. People didn't know how things were going to end. But even on Perkins's own terms, why does he take the enormous retainer to keep quiet after he has had his awakening during a Caribbean sailing vacation and quit his terrible, no good life as an EHM? You're not really allowed two breaking points in one lifetime. There are some pungent ideas about power in a post-colonial world here, but, dude, nobody cares that you're related to Thomas Paine. Stop comparing your life choices to that of American Revolutionary war heroes, it's creepy."
4,"A broken man who desperately wants his life back 
 A bloodthirsty, sadistic and sick-in-the-head contract killer who tries with all his might to prevent this from happening 
 Two lost souls who eventually find true love and happiness after all they have been through 
 And a touching reunion of two best friends presumed to be dead (well, at least one of them...) 
 All of this should have set the stage for a solid 5-star-read for me, but somehow it took me kind of forever to finish this book. Don't get me wrong, the story was good, but not quite as good as the first one. Okay, I have to admit that I was in a shitty mood throughout the first half of the book... Of course, the book was not the reason for my mood, but it was kind of dragging and not captivating enough to pull me out of it, either, which is saying something. The second half, though, I enjoyed more and read it in just a few hours of my reading time, which is also saying something in turn. ;-) 
 But - goddamnit - the killing scenes were once again a bit too... detailed for me, so to speak. Normally, I'm not overly sensitive and have read quite a few books where a killer vents his anger and sadistic streak on someone else, but this was... way too much TMI! *shudders* So, be warned, this might be not for the faint of heart. 
 Damien and Sionn were adorable, the sex scenes hot and I loved the chemistry when the two of them were together. 
 Oh, and not to forget the Morgans... They are the reason why I gave this book 4 stars. I love every single one of them!!! Actually, this book felt more like a 3.5-4 stars read, but since I'm kind of the glass-half-full type, I always round my half stars up. ;-)"

3,"Just as I was starting to like America, she spends the whole of this book annoying me to no end -- and it would be a stretch to say I'm excited to read book three. If anything, I am at most just very curious to see how in hell she's gonna redeem herself. If even."
4,"In the rapture of my enormous humiliation I live in your warm life, and you shall die--die, sweetly die--into mine. I cannot help it; as I draw near to you, you, in your turn, will draw near to others, and learn the rapture of that cruelty, which yet is love; so, for a while, seek to know no more of me and mine, but trust me with all your loving spirit. 
 Carmilla proved to be a delicious detour. Such was a GR group read. I flashed from the gate on a rather warm October evening and finished the novel in a single vault. Unlike the more famous Dracula, Carmilla maintains a sustained focus on the titular creature. Her danger is not being simply a lesbian vampire but rather someone who saddles up to victims, recognizes their insecurities, their vulnerability and pursues and cultivates such to a slow boil and unseemly ends. The Central European milieu affords a pulsating menace whereas the novel's female protagonist proceeds blindly into the wicked endeavor. Her loneliness has been seized by the vampire and she's reluctant to acknowledge her peril. The conclusion is a fitfully bloody affair and worth anyone's time"
5,"Well... there were some things in this story that I saw coming (Rachel's destiny anyone) and then there were others that completely surprised me (Hades change of heart?). I will say that I thought that this was a brilliant end to the Percy Jackson quintet of novels. I will say that the fact that the entire thing was practically one long battle did have me missing the usual A-B-C quest type narrative, but the twists and turns were excellent and I especially liked how Annabeth and Percy got their acts together in the end. Rick Riordan is a brilliant Author and I can't wait to read the Heroes of Olympus series."
4,"I have to say, The Bazaar from Uncle Steve was a bit of a letdown. Stephen King is, obviously, one of the most-hyped authors of today, which is why the fall from so high can be so hard for his readers. This collection of previously published works, in itself, had a range like open arms - from eye-roll-warranting clunkers that never took off and seemed rather (dare I say it?) juvenile for such a master wordsmith to others that truly took my breath away and really explored the mental and emotional crevices of humanity in a way that was breathtakingly clear and surprising - similar to reaching the summit of a huge roller coaster and seeing the landscape around you for those vivid two seconds before being dragged back down again. Billy Blockade, Bad Little Kid and Under the Weather, I'm looking at you now. Overall, I will remember this collection as a hodgepodge that had some really great highlights - and those highlights are what I will take from it. The short introductions to each story were a real treat. Those anecdotes and revelations were the extra seasoning that this collection needed to thread it all together. However, it would've been cool if the original place of publication had been added to those intro snippets; after all, we all knew that most of them were previously published anyway. 
 Mile 81 - 
 This story was surprisingly and glaringly amateur. I appreciate that he led us into that with the knowledge that it was one of his earliest works, but it left an awful taste in my mouth and a hesitation to continue on with the collection. Not the best choice for starting out; better to bury that one somewhere in the middle. No stars. 
 Premium Harmony - 
 Deliciously dry and sardonic. The dialogue hit the nail on the head in that matter-of-fact sort of way that makes you laugh out loud, and the title - fittingly ironic indeed - tied the humor and storyline all together. Great story! **** 4 stars 
 Batman and Robin Have an Altercation - 
 The father-son storyline warmed the heart, but there wasn't much else here. * 1 star 
 The Dune - 
 This story had a setting and cadence that really made the story, but this one would've been more compelling if it had showcased action scenes (which King definitely seems to have shied away from in this collection on a whole). At minimum, it would have carried more resonance if the narrator hadn't described the deaths in such a half-removed-from-the-situation fashion. Nonetheless, the voice and pace were very steady and controlled, allowing me to trust both the author's hand and the narrator's voice. **** 4 stars 
 Bad Little Kid - 
 Awesome story! Sinister, slow and, at times, somber, but never too much. It was a true King story for his avid readers, his hand for the disturbing on full display here. ***** 5 stars 
 A Death - 
 A great ""period"" piece mixed with a little ""local color"" - sorry King, I know you have ""no use for that."" This one was an excellent example of how dialogue and regional slang can really set the scene and shape a work! **** 4 stars 
 The Bone Church - 
 I'm all for contemporary poetry that doesn't follow the rules, but the two poetry selections presented here proved that I am not a fan of King's attempts at that particular form of art. Disjointed and confusing, this one gets no stars. 
 Morality - 
 This story was very well written, but anti-climactic for sure, particularly the ending. Sure - it was a real-world sort of ending, but it didn't live up to the hype at all, and the ""crime"" that was so central to the story's theme was so minor, I couldn't believe all the hyperventilation they were doing over it! Good story telling, but not much there to sink my teeth into. ** 2.5 stars 
 Afterlife - 
 This story had a biting humor, juxtaposed by the two main characters' past interactions with women, that added a new an unexpected layer to this story. The 50s setting and various decades referenced as they discuss the mistakes of their past gave this one body and made it more memorable and 3-D. Good story. *** 3.5 stars 
 Ur - 
 UGH! This story was great for the sort of Super Bowl celebrity selling out that we expect to see in commercials, but this one SERIOUSLY took away a lot of King's street cred! Great for Kindle/Amazon propaganda, but an otherwise ridiculous attempt with a cop-out, oh-this-story-is-getting-to-be-way-to-long-so-let's-just-end-it-now sort of finale. Definitely warranted more than a few eye rolls. One star for referencing the cool possibility of authors writing new and previously unexplored works in other dimensions, but that's about it. * 1 star 
 Herman Wouk Is Still Alive - 
 I LOVED the blunt and unornamented examination of life that this one provided. It was so real, in fact, that it was almost pure. This look at real life aimed for the authentic and came from a character's POV who was really examining it all for the first time. Thought-provoking and funny, this one was a winner. The story would've really hit the mark if it hadn't been watered down by the elderly couple's POV. **** 4 stars 
 Under the Weather - 
 AWESOME story; definitely one of the best of the bunch! I felt a nod to ""A Rose for Emily"" in this one that I loved; it was macabre in a delectable way that resonated loudly at the end. It had all of the elements of a good short story and a King-worthy ending. The thread about the dream really tied this one together. ***** easily 5 stars 
 Blockade Billy - 
 This one was another long one, but I truly did not mind it being long at all! The jargon here was thick as molasses, which I didn't always get, but it didn't take away from the story; in a lot of ways, it made the story. I felt like I was a part of their world, which is the whole reason that people read when they could just watch a movie. The ending was KILLLER. Really. Killer. ***** easily 5 stars 
 Mr. Yummy - 
 This one didn't live up to the intro that King wrote for it; it was neither about desire nor AIDS (for that matter), which made it a bit of a letdown. The irony and humor of the ""grim reaper"" aspect made the story unique, but this one seemed like a failed attempt overall because those topics were just mentioned in passing, not really explored as the intro seemed to promise. *** 3 stars 
 Tommy - 
 No comment is comment enough. Not a fan of Uncle Stevie's poetry in this collection. 
 The Little Green God of Agony - 
 Umm, not a winner for me. This was like R.L. Stine's Goosebumps on steroids (mild steroids that made it appropriate for an adult, not extreme steroids that made it King-like). Enough said. ** 2 stars for the humor added by the nurse's thoughts and the dynamic between she and her boss. 
 That Bus Is Another World - 
 Good little short with a surprise ending. I'll tip a nod here to King for putting his characteristic examination of humanity into this one. *** 3 stars 
 Obits - 
 Didn't live up to the phenomenal story I thought I was getting (because of its length and premise highlighted on the jacket flap). You'd think that only the best stories would be highlighted there, but, in my opinion, the opposite happened. This one also veered towards juvenile at times and the ending was...whhhhaaaaat?... a letdown for sure. ** 2.5 stars for the premise 
 Drunken Fireworks - 
 This one had absolutely nothing to do with horror or even the vaguely macabre. Though King shared his distaste for the term, this one was definitely just an episode of ""local color,"" which is likely why he felt the need to defend against that. ** 2 stars 
 Summer Thunder - 
 Sure, what better way to end the collection than with the apocalypse, I agree. This, however, showed again how King didn't jump in to tackle the big action scenes but settled for examining the aftermath, or 3rd person removed version of them. Other than that, it was a solid story, worthy of the King brand, with an ending that was foreshadowed but...comme si comme ca."
5,"My kids enjoyed it. My 5 year old always asked to read another chapter of ""Ida B. Ida B. I-da-Beeeee"" :)"
4,"I watched the movie based on this book in July and really liked it, so I figured I should read the book as well :) 
 You know how often the book is better than the movie. Well, in this case: IT TOTALLY IS!! 
 Some things that bothered me in the movie were much better explained in the book and I really enjoyed seeing more of Henri, I felt he was a bit lacking in character in the movie. In the book he is awesome. AWESOME! 
 And Bernie Kosar. The dog who may or not be a dog is beyond AWESOME! I have such a thing for fictional animals, it's a bit embarassing. 
 The only thing is, I wasn't completely sold on the romance. I mean, I know most romances start out with physical attraction and continue because of personality, but well, this didn't really feel real to me and I thought Sarah's character wasn't as well-developed as it could have been. 
 But the legacies, they were AWESOME! (I've been saying awesome a lot, but it just feels like the right word for this book) I loved that John had visions John of his home planet and we get to see more of what it was like before the Mogadorians invaded. 
 The last battle was way more epic than in the movie and I really enjoyed it. Major event that had been in the movie a lot sooner finally happened here and it made me sad. I'm so trying not to be spoilery, but it's hard. 
 I'm really looking forward to reading The Power of Six, the next book in the series, because I'm dying to know what happens next! 
 My rating: 4 stars"
4,"I really like this book even though it gets a lot of crap about the BDSM element, which is not overwhelming. Christian is so great and is what every woman hopes for, a man who will change something about themselves just to be with you."
4,"I have had this book in my TBR list for a long time, it sounded interesting but the book blurb didn't really grab me. I finally read it and I ended up really liking this book! 
 (view spoiler)[ 
 Alayna- I rooted for her the entire story. I felt her struggle with her addiction, I cringed when she nearly ""relapsed,"" I loved when she told off Sophia. 
 Hudson- One of the reasons I didn't read this right away was the whole billionaire business man and the poor girl angle- but Hudson is a great character. I hope we learn more about him in the next few books. I know there is a Hudson POV book that came out a few months ago, that's exciting.

5,"Love this series! How can I resist a book that uses my favourite novel as a plot device?! I can't! If you haven't started The Shadow of the Wind series yet, you need to. These books are phenomenal, and even if they set up more mysteries, it doesn't seem forced at all. Amazing."
1,"I was looking forward to reading this one based on the amazing summary and it was a huge disappointment. 
 Okay, first of all, this book needed more editing. 
 Now, am I the only one that didn't like it? I guess... 
 About Mia, girl, you don't go on a vacation with a that you only know for three freaking days and sleep with him after you have both confessed that 'this relationship' is too much too soon. Just NO. 
 You can't let your best friend/roommate/only friend ever/one night stand/occasional fuck slap your ass in the office, on your first day while your boyfriend and boss watches you. WTF?! 
 SO many things wrong with this book I can't even remember all of it. 
 How is Marcus a mob boss? 
 Mia, while your having a miscarriage and bleeding all over the freaking place, you don't have the time to snoop around your boyfriend's office and read papers WHILE bleeding, instead of going to the FREAKING HOSPITAL."
2,"I generally like historic mysteries, especially Victorian ones, but this one had periods of very good writing, and periods of meandering plot. The basic mystery that Thomas Pitt has to solve is the disappearance of a Spanish woman who has arrived in London to preach, what many people consider, blasphemous ideas. She has plenty of enemies who might want to tarnish her reputation or kill her. Thomas must dig into her history in both England and Spain to solve this crime. Although the summary sounded interesting, the execution was mediocre and definitely not as good as Anne Perry's mysteries typically are."
4,"I'm definitely gonna keep things vague here, but if you enjoy space operas - or even urban fantasy - with a good dose of romance, you should be RUNNING to the closest possible place you can pick these books up! I mean, there are space pirates, big blobs of death, hot dudes with black scales and creepy, insane little girls. What else could you ask for? 
 Check out my full review on the blog!"
5,"FREDRIK FREDRIK FREDRIK FREDRIK. 
 IF YOU ARE SO SO SAD JUST TAKE ME. TAKE ME AND I WILL LOVE YOU FOREVER. 
 TAKE ME NOW FREDRIK GUSTAVVSON!!!"
4,"This book was the best one out of the series, everything finally starts coming together! 
 This was the best book in my opinion because everything we've found out about and waited to see what would happen finally finds a way to get resolved. The way that the team bands together through these times just goes to show how far they've come since the beginning. 
 But be warned there were some really fucked up moments that happened in this one..."
3,"Idk, I liked The Thin Man well enough, I found Norah and Nick very charming, plus I really liked the movie with Humphrey Bogart too but eh... 
 - while the maltese falcon, idk i loved the movie, but it was SUCH. A. CHORE. just getting through it 
 - i feel like dashiell hammett is the very epitome of male novelist jokes http://the-toast.net/2013/11/04/male-... 
 - also missing is the iconic last line of the film, w/c is actually from the tempest. i was waiting for it the whole book and i feel cheated 
 - but apparently it's just something humphrey bogart suggested while filming so ok 
 Fave line: 
 ""Jesus God! Is this the first thing you guys ever stole? You're a fine lot of lollipops!"""
4,"I like this series. It had a lot of interesting world building dynamics mixing machines and magic together. Unfortunately for me that felt like a mixed bag for some thing remained a little confusing through the first book and into this on. This book does clear a little bit dynamics of the world only to add more questions. I did like the relationship between Javier and Kiram although once again the world building left me confused how each of their worlds could live so closely together with the religious persecution the they faced in the Cadeleonian society. 
 I liked the adventure and the bonding of the characters. I love the idea of two societies that are like mirrors to each other. I enjoyed reading the story and didn't really think about the things that the book didn't flesh out of explain better. But after I got to the last page I felt like there was something missing. Now after finishing the book I can think of a dozen unanswered questions and places in the story that needed more attention."
5,"Wholly satisfying. I would've enjoyed an epilogue, but that's just me being greedy. The writing is fabulous, and I love that so far the author's alpha heroes develop without being OOC and the heroines are strong, self-aware, and realistic. If not physically strong enough, they will do their damnedest to survive, using wits and only a women's strength until help arrives, or fight and die trying when they think all is lost. The appearances of previous characters and hints of what's to come with the upcoming ones are just enough without overshadowing the main characters. Definitely an author to look out for. She's going on my auto-buy list."
4,More of our questions are answered in this third book in the series... but are they the right questions? That remains to be seen.
2,"2 Zorn Star's 
 Ral's Woman 
 is the first book in the sci-fi romance 
 Zorn Warriors 
 series. Well I've not read much sci-fi alien romance love stores, so I don't have much to compare this too, though I have read other Laurann Dohner works and I must say Ral's Woman was poorly done. 
 Ral is a Zorn alien. Him and his people have been cavorted and in slaved by the lizard aliens to mine the astroid/ship. When he meets Ariel he is really curious about her and is eager to learn the ways of pleasing a woman of her species. He's very partitive of Ariel: 
 ""She is mine. Don't touch her. You touch her. You Die."" 
 Ariel well first I thought of the little mermaid and had a good laugh, but moving on. Ariel is human and she has been kidnapped from Earth by lizard type aliens who want to breed her. As it turned out she is not compatible to breed with the lizard guys, so instead they give her to the Zorn who they have in slaved to mine their astroid/ship. The Zorn must fight and the winner gets her. Ral wins and takes her to his room caveman style where they have hot sex. Then he starts saying that she is his. 
 ""I think you don not understand. You are mine for life. I claim you. I won you. I will keep you. We will breed often and I am hoping you will take my seed to root."" 
 It's a very simple read, short, not very well done, and predictable. Not much world creation, but maybe in the other books it comes out. The description of sex scenes was poor, character development is nell, and I never felt a connection between Ariel and Ral. Maybe it was supposed to happen when they locked eyes at first meeting, but I felt nothing and as the book progressed I still did not feel that love connection even when they mentioned love."
